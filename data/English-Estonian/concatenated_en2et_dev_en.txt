on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (NL) Ladies and gentlemen, as you have probably seen, in the last couple of weeks the Commissioner and I have come in for a great deal of criticism from certain circles in Turkey.
It is claimed that we do not understand Turkey properly, that we do not really realise what is going on in Turkey.
I must admit, sometimes there are a number of things in Turkey that I do not understand.
For instance, I cannot understand that many people in Turkey have no problem with the fact that the governing party, which won 47% of the votes in the last elections, is in danger of being banned by the Constitutional Court.
What I also do not understand is that the Council of Europe recommendations on the prohibition of political parties were so easily passed over, because it is clear that the case against the AKP in no way meets the criteria.
What I also do not understand is that it is so easily overlooked that, by banning the AKP and the DTP, about 90% of votes in the south-east were declared invalid, with all that that entails.
What I also do not understand is that so much fuss was made in Turkey about the Commissioner and I criticising the fact that, in our opinion, a political case is one that, if it leads to the banning of the governing party, will really have serious consequences.
In my view, it is our duty to say that and we should continue doing so.
However, there are other things I do not understand.
What I do not understand is why it was impossible for the authorities to allow the trade unions to demonstrate peacefully in Istanbul on 1 May, even in Taksim Square, such a symbolic place since 1977.
What I also do not really understand is why it was impossible for the authorities to distinguish between rioters and trade unions seeking to exercise their democratic rights.
I also do not understand why so much excessive violence was necessary against peaceful demonstrators and innocent passers-by.
I shall end by expressing the hope that this Parliament will continue, as in this report, to encourage reforms, but also to criticise the government and the opposition if these do not take place, in a way that I would describe as clear, explicit, with respect for each other's views, but without taboos.
I firmly believe that, if that happens, we in Turkey and the European Union will in the end understand each other better.
<D>
Mr President, I object to a report on the Lisbon Treaty being rushed through this House before Members are given the Treaty in a readable, contextual form.
We have been sent amendments that, in that form, are nonsense.
Would we vote on other reports in this House based on amendments, without having seen the document?
Should we take this report on faith?
As legislators, this is not what our constituents have sent us to Strasbourg to do.
I come from Ireland.
We are having a referendum.
As news of this spreads, I am receiving requests for the Treaty every day.
When I have to tell people there is no readable version, they are incredulous.
But when I tell them that this is by decree of the Intergovernmental Conference, they are angry.
I have no doubt this feeling is even more intense for other frustrated peoples of Europe, who are denied a referendum.
But I can only imagine how people will react when they hear that their MEPs passed this report on a Treaty that they have not read.
I will let you in on a secret.
Our citizens are intelligent, thoughtful and well capable of playing their democratic role in their own governance.
And what we are doing here today, and throughout this Lisbon process, is a betrayal of our citizens, the very citizens whose cooperation and hard work we will need to further the European project.
I warn you: do not be surprised if, some day, these same long-suffering citizens refuse that cooperation.
<D>
in writing. - (PL) I am glad that the European Parliament is dealing with lobbying.
This cannot be a taboo subject for public opinion.
Certain rules are required, and transparency is essential.
This is a sensitive area in political and economic terms.
We are aware that lawmakers benefit from the subject-specific knowledge gained from contacts with experts.
This is also a type of dialogue with society, and has a kind of reciprocal effect.
After all, Members and officials of the European Commission and other institutions do not operate in their own isolated world.
The knowledge gained enables them to create better and more user-friendly legislation.
On the other hand, the question of unfair influence on lawmaking arises.
There are also instances when the law is slanted so as to favour the interests of specific pressure groups, such as pro-abortionists and large corporations.
This leads directly to corruption and the final outcome is not genuine legislation but a hotchpotch of provisions.
Will we really contrive to make legal provisions stricter and tighten them up so as to prevent inappropriate lobbying and corruption?
Sadly, the answer is obvious.
We will be unable to do so.
It will always be possible to find a loophole in the provisions or a way around them.
We should also bear in mind that so-called bad lobbying is also possible through direct contacts in the Member States.
I am positively inclined towards the report, but cannot accept the amendments whereby churches are deemed to be lobby groups.
We must consider ethics, compliance with transparency and morality as well as the letter of the law.
Morality can never be the enemy of democracy!
<D>
Madam President, tobacco growers are being cruelly persecuted, as the anti-smoking campaign is tantamount to an anti-tobacco policy.
As a result, tobacco grown in the EU is considered unhealthy, while imported tobacco is not.
This is inconsistent, unscientific and unfair.
The results of this policy are well known: despite the campaigns, smoking is on the increase, whereas production in the EU is in sharp decline.
Jobs are being lost, tens of thousands of small and medium-sized tobacco growers are being ruined, yet tobacco imports have risen to more than EUR 1.2 billion a year.
Tobacco growing in Greece has declined by 73%.
Ever-increasing numbers of tobacco growers are unemployed.
Whole areas are being abandoned because no alternative crops are grown there.
We consider it essential to repeal the regulation transferring 50% of direct aid to the second pillar from 2010.
All deductions from subsidies should be abolished immediately to allow tobacco growing to continue, since 70% of demand is met by imports.
Subsidies should be linked to production; they should be an integral part of the guaranteed minimum prices corresponding to the production cost of each variety.
As the Berlato report contains positive elements supporting all of this, we, the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece (KKE), will approve it.
<D>
Madam President, in March 2007 under the German presidency, and again in March 2008 under the Slovenian, Europe's leaders committed themselves to achieving a target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 20% by 2020, an already limited ambition.
Let us be under no illusion: in order to secure a post-2012 international agreement on climate change at Copenhagen, we will have to make a clear and unambiguous statement through our legislation.
The current international financial liquidity crisis and the economic backdrop has allowed many to grow cautious of setting long-term CO2 targets or of committing industry to achieving the necessary greenhouse gas reductions and thus driving Europe's economy forward towards the low-carbon, sustainable economy which we so desperately need and which, I agree, will spark a third industrial revolution with exciting first-mover advantage for Europe in the whole area of new technologies.
However, the EU's post-2012 targets should not be seen in the light of the current economic crisis.
I believe our governments will be able to resolve that in the shorter term and we must deliver now so that future generations will not bear the brunt - including the economic brunt - of any delay in terms of the climate and energy package.
We cannot pay the higher price in the future for our inability to act now or history will not be kind to us - or as President Sarkozy said, we will miss our date with history.
The European Parliament has given me, as one of the rapporteurs on the climate package, a strong mandate to lead negotiations with Council in the trialogue, and I take this responsibility seriously.
We must maintain the targets and timetable and, as Mr Sarkozy said, major ambition with some compromise will be the order of the day.
I look forward to a very close cooperation with both the Commission and the Council under the French presidency.
I believe that together we can and will find an effective and workable agreement on the climate and energy package by this December...
(The President cut off the speaker.)
<D>
(DE) Mr President, as transport policy stands today, Europe is aiming at more transport software, i.e. more intelligent solutions to improve efficiency, but also to serve the interests of the environment and health protection.
We will not go into the detailed reasons for this change, although surely it has much to do with the fact that we do not have the money for large new infrastructure projects - see, for instance, the rather modest funds allocated to the TENs and suchlike.
Under these circumstances it is most important to ensure that new hardware is not let in through the back door on Austrian and European transport routes.
I, like a number of others, am referring to the 60-tonners or gigaliners or whatever we call them.
At any rate, they can certainly not be authorised in an infrastructure that is not appropriate for them; they might be a good solution on flat land where there is little traffic, but they would be totally misplaced in mountainous and densely built-up areas.
Austria in particular is in no way equipped for superweight trucks.
Over the past few months we have seen again and again what they mean in terms of bridge construction and the weight they can bear.
We have no interest whatsoever in landing ourselves with new problems here.
It is not in the interests of transport policy either, and especially not in the interest of health and environmental policy.
If we cannot produce any extra European funds to pay for the external costs of the existing infrastructure, then we should leave things as they are or, in this concrete case, leave the gigaliners in northern Finland.
<D>
Vice-President of the Commission. - (DE) Mr President, honourable Members, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Neris, for her efforts in working on such a comprehensive and technically complicated proposal.
This is a law-making process that has created great challenges for us all, but we must be clear that what we are talking about here is the future of an extraordinarily important sector.
Construction products alone already make up 3% of internal European products, and if we include construction activity, the construction sector amounts to 10% of the total economic output of the European Union.
It is absolutely clear, therefore, that efforts to improve the competitiveness of this sector - especially in the current crisis - are particularly important.
With this proposal, we are aiming to create a solid basis for the consolidation of the internal market for construction products.
Only in that way can we secure the necessary growth and jobs beyond the recovery phase.
In order to achieve this goal, the current Construction Products Directive must be brought into line with the principles of better law-making.
I will now set out what we were trying to achieve.
We wanted to clarify the basic concepts and the use of the CE mark, simplify the procedures in order to reduce costs for businesses, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises, and to raise the credibility of the entire system.
For me, it was about avoiding any unnecessary additional burdens for businesses, especially for the smallest companies.
I therefore think it is important that no new administrative or assessment procedures are introduced, something that is of vital importance, above all, for the smallest local companies.
In accordance with the principles of the Small Business Act, which was, I would point out, given an extraordinarily warm welcome by this House not long ago, the Commission proposal puts forward simplified procedures for micro-businesses when it comes to products that do not give rise to any serious safety concerns.
I do not want to see this approach changed - it is one of the key points of the proposal.
This is because, in practice, it is the case for a number of families of construction products - such as windows, internal doors and floorings - that the existence of very small manufacturers is extremely important for the functioning of the market and is in the interests of consumers.
The potential of these small manufacturers must be exploited efficiently for the benefit of the European construction industry.
I do not share the opinion that it is necessary to prescribe the declaration of hazardous substances going beyond the rules that we have already put in place under the REACH regulation.
I assure you in all earnest that the rules laid down under the REACH regulations cover everything - there is nothing more that we would need to do for the construction sector - all the concerns that I have heard are comprehensively covered by the REACH regulation.
I really do wonder what point there would be in having comprehensive, integrated legislation on chemicals if we were then to go and introduce new and deviating regulations for individual products.
There is no way that the Commission would support such an idea.
Finally, I will deal with CE-marking and the abolition of national labelling.
Let me be quite clear on this: where prescribed, national labelling adds additional testing requirements for construction products over and above the provisions of harmonised European standards, but it does not give any added value at all in terms of content.
All it adds is more red tape and more work for the businesses in question.
That is directly opposed to the main goal of the proposal.
The construction sector's situation is different from that of the traditional areas of what has been called our 'new approach law-making', which was recently the subject of the internal market package.
We cannot simply copy the solutions implemented in the other sectors of 'new approach law-making' in the construction industry as it has a completely different structure and works with completely different materials.
For understandable reasons I have not gone into every amendment.
We will inform Parliament's staff in writing of the Commission's position in relation to the rest of Parliament's amendments.
The proposal for a regulation on construction products is a very important proposal, in my view.
I consider today's debate important and I share the view of the rapporteur that, with a little more time, we still have a good chance of achieving a result together and reaching a sound compromise.
<D>
(PL) Madam President, political and economic relations with Ukraine are of great importance to us.
Each year we can see a rise in investment in Ukraine, and this includes a European dimension.
These investments are having a beneficial effect in many sectors - including on consumers in Ukraine - by increasing levels of consumption.
The involvement of foreign banks in the Ukrainian banking sector has already reached 35%.
The services sector is of fundamental and vital importance for the Ukrainian economy.
It needs further reform and investment if it is to reach the level of development of this sector in EU countries.
The same is true of other areas of the Ukrainian economy, including the health-care and tourism sectors.
We need to develop and reinforce our economic relations between Ukraine and the European Union.
We must bear in mind that Ukraine is an important transit country for us from the aspect of energy security in Europe.
We also appreciate the efforts being made by Ukraine, including legislative efforts, linked to the expansion of economic dialogue with Europe and the recently attained WTO membership.
<D>
(NL) Mr President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, if we look at the agenda of the spring summit we find an almost complete list of the socio-economic and ecological challenges facing our generation: that is, if we want to take responsibility for those who come after us in a time of globalisation, climate change, technological advances and an ageing demographic.
Without doubt we are responsible for the objectives and the approaches necessary to achieve this, and of course we expect everyone to do what they have said they will do and that sufficient pressure will be exerted at all political levels to achieve results.
As group coordinator for the Lisbon Strategy I want to say how much we value the fact that the Commission has presented the Community Lisbon Programme.
Each of the 10 points gets our full support, and the same goes for the announcement of the Small Business Act.
This is on condition, however, that the Small Business Act pays more than just lip service to SMEs.
This Act, Mr President, must therefore become more than the SME Charter, which was approved in Santa Maria da Feira some years ago.
To do its job, the Small Business Act must ensure that the best possible operating environment is created for SMEs, and that applies to very small, small and medium-sized enterprises.
To this end, one condition is absolutely necessary and must apply at every stage, to substantive measures or mere simplification measures: think small first.
Take the SME as the point of departure and not as an exception, and let us take this as a binding criterion so that it at last becomes more than just a slogan.
It is only in this way that we will truly succeed in getting through to the firms that form the bulk of our business environment, but, more importantly, that provide the greatest number of jobs and the jobs that are currently being created.
It would be a very good thing, Members of the Commission and of the Council, if tomorrow at the spring Council this binding principle could be agreed upon once and for all.
Thank you for your attention.
<D>
Mr President, by lifting the ban on the import of chickens from the United States, the European Commission is once again showing that it places the interests of the food multinationals above the health of the people and workers.
For decades, the United States has been pushing for the import of hormone-treated meat.
Now it is doing the same for its chickens.
In previous years the ban was based on the danger posed by the chlorine and chicken dips.
According to the scientific community, chlorinated chickens endanger the health of consumers and slaughterhouse workers and make for dangerous waste material with carcinogenic residues.
The substances used in the United States have obviously not stopped being carcinogenic, just as the scientific community has not changed its mind.
The question is, then, what has led the Commission to give in to pressure from the United States and the multinationals, and what does it get in return for this change in position?
The food production chain is increasingly in the stranglehold of the food multinationals.
Just a few days after the scandal of sunflower oil mixed with mineral oils, and the discovery that legislation allows the transportation of oil in the same tankers used to carry fluids dangerous to health, the European Commission did not bat an eyelid in announcing the lifting of the ban on chlorinated chickens.
One food scandal follows another.
The EU is shifting the responsibility of inspection on to those who should be inspected; it is abdicating its own responsibilities, just like the governments of the Member States; it is transferring responsibility to consumers, on the grounds that they have the right to choose, provided the products are labelled.
The workers demand properly inspected, healthy foods at affordable prices.
The opposition by the workers, their organisations and the scientific community to the lifting of the ban must oblige the Commission to revise its decision.
The ban on chlorinated chickens for consumption must continue to pertain.
<D>
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the IAS system makes sense for big listed companies that operate worldwide.
That is why, during Parliament's last term, we decided, on the Legal Affairs Committee's proposal, to adopt the IAS Regulation.
The ultimate aim - as Alexander Radwan has said - was indeed to achieve convergence, at least with the USA and if possible worldwide.
The system makes no sense in the case of small and medium-sized companies because, as a rule, they have no need of international financial markets, no need of Wall Street and the rest.
For that reason alone, the necessity of developing IFRS for small and medium-sized companies is highly questionable.
On top of that - and I think Commissioner McCreevy was entirely right here - the current proposal is for nothing more than a slimmed-down version of what are, by any measure, extremely complicated international standards, entirely unsuited to the structure of small and medium-sized companies in Europe.
They are particularly ill-suited to family companies, which have been run by their owners for several generations; which have already written off property belonging to them; and in which the application of fair-value rules would simply encourage greed and, in the end, could very well jeopardise the companies' chances of survival.
On the other hand, we must be realistic.
Ultimately, the question of accounting standards for SMEs in Europe will not be exempt from some form of pressure for harmonisation.
Our demand is for comparability, at least within the Single Market.
So I think it is important that we should seriously consider how to develop European alternatives to the proposals from London, with the aim of achieving greater standardisation in this area too - but standardisation that is sensible and appropriate for SMEs and geared to the long term, rather than short-term valuation.
I have one further point to make about the IAS bodies.
There is a real problem here, as Alexander Radwan has outlined.
There may be a certain geographical balance but there is no balance in terms of economic weight.
Europe is by far the largest bloc, the largest region in which the IAS rules apply.
That is why we must have a commensurate say, and we simply cannot be compared with somewhere like Australia.
Australia carries the same weight as a middle-sized EU country or, indeed, a big region like North Rhine-Westphalia.
The balance needs to be improved in this respect.
<D>
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, a whole series of neighbouring countries are physically involved in this war and there is, above all, direct participation from Congolese government troops, together with militia and Angolan troops on one side, with General Nkunda, Tutsi soldiers and Rwandan support on the other.
It is a regional war which does not just concern eastern Congo.
One key point is clear: the Congolese government has thus far not been prepared to negotiate directly with the rebels.
That is a point on which pressure must be applied.
It is very important to examine the real background to this conflict.
The Federal President of Germany himself has made reference to the fact that this is a conflict about raw materials.
Crude oil, gold, diamonds, copper, cobalt, coltan, zinc, tin and so on play a very important role here.
Above all, it is also about who actually holds the relevant licences to exploit these materials.
Action really has to be taken against these companies.
I just want to name one of these companies: Gesellschaft für Elektrometallurgie mbh, based in Nuremberg, is clearly the direct owner of one of the central mines over which this conflict is being fought.
I would like to talk a little about the role of the United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUC), since everyone in the House seems to be calling for MONUC to be re-supplied.
According to what I read, it is the case that MONUC is part of the problem rather than part of the solution, because MONUC itself describes its situation as having developed into fighting on four fronts.
MONUC's role should actually be quite different.
In the meantime, we have found out from Human Rights Watch that Indian or Pakistani MONUC soldiers are conducting direct weapons trading with irregular militias and are clearly involved in the conflict for raw materials.
That cannot be allowed to happen.
MONUC's role must be something else entirely and completely neutral.
That being the case, calling for MONUC to be re-supplied is not all that helpful.
I would also like to again point out that Congo played an important role once before in a previous European Union operation.
At that time, it was the security of elections that was our role and Mr Kabila was installed as president - the same Mr Kabila whose troops are now a significant escalating factor.
With that in mind, there should be close scrutiny of the actual role played by the EU in Mr Kabila's installation.
I find what the EU did to be very problematic.
The point must clearly be made that Mr Kabila and his troops must also be criticised in this respect.
The report by the local correspondent of the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper, who was captured, made very worthwhile reading.
He described the set-up of the conflict very well.
His article shows the interaction between official and unofficial troops, which is to say that calling for the re-supply of MONUC alone is pointless, as what is really needed is to get to grips with the causes of the conflict.
<D>
Mr President, the Goldstone report is exceptionally unbalanced and unfair.
It comes from the United Nations Human Rights Council, whose members include countries such as Iran, Nicaragua, Somalia and Libya.
What right do those countries have, where respect for human rights has been reduced to zero, to evaluate Israel, the only democracy in the Middle East?
The report comes from a very suspect source which is obsessively ill-disposed towards Israel.
Out of the 25 resolutions on human rights which the UN Human Rights Council has adopted, as many as 20 are devoted to Israel.
Not one of them is about the countries which are members of the Council, countries which, and I stress this, have an awful human rights record from women's rights to electoral rights.
I stress that this report is completely unbalanced.
It attempts, in fact, to absolve the terrorist activity of Hamas.
The report does not state the fundamental fact that, in the eight years before Israel, in its own defence, took action in the Gaza Strip, thousands of rockets were fired at innocent Israeli citizens.
Every country has the right to defend itself against terrorists.
Israel, too, has that right.
It should also be said that 150 criminal investigations of the actions of particular Israeli soldiers are currently under way in Israel.
In Israel, there is a free parliament, and there is a free press which often criticises its own government and its own armed forces.
None of these features is to be found, unfortunately, on the terrorist side.
I think, therefore, that this unbalanced and unfair report, which, in my opinion, attacks our main ally in the Middle East in a shameless fashion, should not be taken seriously.
<D>
Mr President, I should first like to thank Mr Arnaoutakis for his question on the ever topical issue of food safety.
The Commission has many ways of ensuring that consumers and European citizens are protected against a possible food crisis.
Firstly, the Commission ensures that the competent authorities in all 27 Member States are promptly and simultaneously warned via the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF).
Secondly, the Commission's Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) carries out systematic inspections in the Member States and in third countries.
Thirdly, the Commission carefully examines all information received from the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the international media or other sources.
Where necessary, and especially when food or feed might seriously threaten public health and that risk cannot be dealt with effectively at Member State level, the Commission takes the necessary measures at EU level.
For example, in the case of the Ukrainian sunflower oil contaminated with mineral oil, the RASFF received notification from the competent French authorities on 23 April 2008, which was received by all the Member States.
The Commission, through the RASFF, at once notified the other Member States of this incident, and on 10 June 2008 it issued Decision 2008/433/EC imposing special conditions governing the import of sunflower oil originating in or consigned from Ukraine due to contamination risks by mineral oil.
Investigations were also launched to locate the source of the contamination.
In addition, the traceability system provided for in Regulation (EC) No 178/2002, better known as the General Food Law Regulation, makes it possible to carry out targeted, accurate product withdrawals or recalls, to supply adequate information to consumers and food business operators, and to evaluate the risks and avoid unnecessary disruption to trade.
The Commission also systematically checks the ability of the Member States' competent inspection authorities to ensure compliance with food legislation, both within and outside the EU.
In Malaysia, for example, the Commission's Food and Veterinary Office identified significant problems in relation to compliance with the requirements for the export of fish products.
In the EU, the Commission reacted immediately, prohibiting the import of fish from Malaysia.
This is just one of many examples of how the Commission effectively manages to protect the consumer and prevent a food crisis.
The Commission therefore believes its existing legislation provides the necessary mechanisms for effective management of food crises and effective consumer protection.
At the same time, however, we are taking care to ensure a steady improvement in the channels of communication and cooperation with the Member States for this purpose.
For example, we are providing new guidelines on using the RASFF, which the Commission is to adopt shortly.
<D>
in writing. - (PT) We believe the report presents a range of positive measures that must be built upon and which the Commission should take forward, in particular:
the need for a substantial Community contribution in respect of major diseases in order to ensure equal treatment and opportunities where these are beyond the resources of the countries and producers concerned;
acknowledgement that EU producers face higher costs due to the higher EU standards in place and that they must be protected from imported animal products produced subject to lower standards;
the need for the Commission to help farmers cope with the high costs incurred through the procurement of the equipment required to register animals.
We still have some criticisms, particularly in the area of public funding, which must be stepped up to avoid the establishment of private insurance to remedy losses due to disease eradication.
We cannot agree with the possibility of farmers being given total responsibility for eradicating diseases by paying for private insurance.
<D>
I think that we have learnt from the failure of Copenhagen.
As proof of this, we must review our strategy so that we can achieve a legally binding agreement in Mexico.
Prompt action is required to translate the political agreement reached into action, as well as to put into operation the EUR 7.2 billion earmarked for 'fast-start financing' for developing countries.
The EU has made known its wish to be associated with the Accord and has made, by way of information, a unilateral commitment to reduce the EU's global emissions by 20% on 1990 levels and a conditional offer of raising this reduction percentage to 30% if other major producers of emissions also agree to contribute by an equivalent proportion to the global effort to cut emissions.
As of 18 February, 40 states have made known their reduction plans and 100 have signed up to the Accord, but this is not enough.
I urge the High Representative and Commissioner for Climate Action to present to us urgently a climate diplomacy strategy and the EU and Member States to include climate change policies in all bilateral and multilateral strategic partnerships in order to achieve this major objective.
Strategic partnerships for combating climate change must include NGOs and civil society.
<D>
Madam President, every week, the press is filled with news of a new or modified proposal from a country, the European Council and the President of the Commission.
I commend the President of the ECB because he has paid heed to the discussions and reports in the Parliament and recognises our direction and determination.
The competitiveness pact and its evolution is a case in point.
We already have a richer tapestry of ideas in our amendments to the economic governance package, so we will have little difficulty in moving into codecision to merge the outcomes of the positions that we take in Parliament and Council.
But we should not cherry-pick from the single market, nor continue to get it wrong.
The single market is not about a fortress with a level playing field inside.
It is about the external competitiveness that a large single market can generate, so it is intimately mixed with the recovery side of economic governance.
We also need a permanent financial stability mechanism capable of evolving over time, subject to governance and priorities.
To the German people, convulsed with the 'transfer union' issue, I say 'look at what accompanies the demands of your own government - recapitalisation of banks and purchase of sovereign debt in a secondary market'.
Germany's banks will take ten years to recognise their impaired assets from the crisis, and that includes sovereign debt.
Germany's banks will not meet new international rules for bank capital, so transfer to German banks should also be the issue on your lips.
That is why you need the mechanism, like all the eurozone.
Finally, on interest rates, there is a balance that has to be struck between sustainability and moral hazard.
(The President cut off the speaker)
<D>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I appreciate the great interest in this proposal, the proof of which lies in the large number of amendment proposals it has given rise to.
This shows that the fight against discrimination in everyday life is a constant priority for most of us, even during a serious economic crisis.
I also welcome the excellent report submitted by Mrs Buitenweg and approved by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, as well as the remarkable contribution from Mrs Lynne and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
The draft report supports the ambition and the attempts of the draft directive submitted by the Commission.
In my opinion the rapporteur has managed to reconcile different viewpoints and to achieve a broad consensus between the various political groups.
I would like to applaud the supporting role played by Parliament in submitting the draft directive.
As far as the proposed amendments are concerned, I agree with many of the improvement suggestions contained in the draft report.
Nevertheless I would like to say that this draft requires unanimous consent in the Council and we must therefore remain realistic.
I know that the problem of multiple discrimination is fundamental to you.
I am fully aware of the fact that people who are victims of multiple discrimination are very seriously affected.
However, at the same time I do think that as this directive applies to only four possible causes for discrimination, this problem cannot be definitively resolved at a legal level.
In the Commission Communication on non-discrimination of July 2008 we committed to launching a discussion on this issue among the newly-established groups of government experts.
The discussion has been launched.
So the question of multiple discrimination is not being neglected.
I could agree to a reference to multiple discrimination in the areas covered by this draft directive.
I agree that we must define the division of powers between the EU and the Member States more clearly.
The directive will not change the definition as such, but our aim is to achieve the greatest possible degree of legal certainty.
I also accept that freedom of expression must be taken into account when considering cases of alleged victimisation.
However, we ought to be aware that the concept of victimisation requires strong proof.
Human dignity must be at stake and there must a hostile or humiliating environment.
I agree to the inclusion of the concept of 'discrimination' by association” in the sense of the recent judgement in the Coleman case, but this concept should be applied only where there is direct discrimination and victimisation.
As far as financial services are concerned, I agree that there is a need for service providers to implement a certain level of transparency, but I have certain doubts about the formulation used in your draft.
I fully agree that the directive should not apply to purely private transactions.
The positions of the Commission and Parliament are very similar here.
As far as the physically disabled are concerned, I can support a reference to the open definition of physical disability used in the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
I also agree in essence with some of the comments on the concept of physical disability that are included in your amendment proposals.
However, I think it is necessary to point out that the wording of the legal regulation must be very precise.
I agree with some of the other ideas that were expressed, but in my opinion it is necessary to ensure that Article 4 is concise and intelligible.
Ladies and gentlemen, I look forward to hearing your opinions, which I will respond to in the debate.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, Madam Vice-President, I would like to water down, if only slightly, the praise you have received from the House, at least as far as the issue of passenger rights is concerned.
We urge the Commission to submit a comprehensive package of proposals for passenger rights throughout the transport sector.
It is gratifying that we already have passenger rights in the air transport industry, although these require urgent review, given that a number of airlines are not applying the relevant regulation in the way that we would wish.
This year, we have also agreed a package of passenger rights for rail users, to be implemented next year.
However, Madam Commissioner, it was announced that passenger rights for people taking long-distance buses would be introduced, and a debate about passenger rights for ferry services has already started.
We do not see either of these proposed measures included in the work programme.
We need these proposals, as we want to have passenger rights for the entire transport sector, for we agree with the Commission: if we want to put the citizen first, one of the best ways of doing this is to introduce passenger rights that apply right across the transport sector.
The second point which I would briefly like to mention is this: we hope that the Commission will implement the planned traffic management systems as envisaged.
Specifically, this means SESAR for a single European sky and ERTMS as the single European Railway Traffic Management System.
With these systems, Madam Vice-President, we are not only making transport safer and cheaper, we are also helping to protect the environment.
You therefore have our full support for the rapid deployment of these systems.
<D>
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my Group does not usually like first-reading agreements, because the quality of the law is often compromised in the rush and pressure to reach agreement.
I have to say, Mr Nassauer, that if you had asked me a year ago whether in my opinion we would reach a bipartisan agreement on protection of the environment through criminal law, with Mr Nassauer as rapporteur and at first reading, I would probably not have believed it.
Nevertheless it has happened, due to excellent teamwork, made possible through strict observance of the informal dialogue procedures with the Commission and the Council who, whenever possible, have involved the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs, and due also to the valuable work of the Environment Committee.
I would therefore like to thank the rapporteur and his colleagues most sincerely because this is an important achievement, as indeed all the other speakers have said.
Mr President, the Court of Justice ruling has clearly prevented us from establishing penalties and this has clipped our wings somewhat but, as a result, I hope that after the vote we, the European Union, will collectively keep this issue in mind.
I think we should pay serious attention to this matter when the Lisbon Treaty has been ratified.
Of course, as with everything in life, this directive is not perfect.
For example, we are not very happy with the complicated annex which gives a long, albeit exhaustive, list of the directives to which this new law is to apply.
We would have preferred simply to have a system proposed by the Commission and approved by the Environment Committee, which made it perfectly clear that a whole series of offences were automatically classed as punishable under criminal law in addition to the directives in question.
Nor are we all that happy with the fact that the transition period is two years.
We feel that this could have been improved and, like Mrs Wallis, we are very pleased about the obligation placed on the Member States to provide correlation tables, in other words States must inform us swiftly of how they are applying the laws, which they often fail to do.
However, we fully support the move to ensure that a series of offences can no longer go unpunished.
I come from a country, Italy, where there has been a temptation to do this, where it has actually been done, and I am pleased that this directive rejects the possibility and that the destruction of natural sites, vandalism and other similar matters will no longer go unpunished.
<D>
(DA) Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Bowis for doing an excellent job in conducting these not-so-easy negotiations.
One of the difficult issues has been help for patients with rare diseases - a topic which we will be discussing here in the latter part of the morning.
We all want to give these patients the best treatment options available and, naturally, we see that close European cooperation in this respect will bring us huge benefits.
However, it will be of no help whatsoever if we merely let patients travel across Europe, without empowering their countries of origin to control such travel, both medically and financially.
If the text is adopted in its current form, it will give all patients suffering from a rare disease the option of travelling abroad and receiving any treatment whatsoever, which their country of origin then has to finance.
However, how do we control spending and how do we ensure that patients do not receive inappropriate or excessive treatment?
After all, they are at the mercy of their care providers.
They also run the risk of coming into serious conflict with their countries of origin, which may refuse to pay up, under the excuse that the disease which they suffer from is not rare enough.
We have not yet reached any agreement on how to identify that section of the patient population.
We would vastly prefer a separate piece of legislation in this area so that we are able to help people with rare diseases in the optimal way possible.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking Parliament for including Lebanon on today's agenda.
Many other developments in the Middle East - especially events in Gaza - have recently occupied our attention.
This should, however, not make us forget the strategic importance of Lebanon for the region and as a partner of Europe.
The present situation in Lebanon is extremely worrying.
The deep political crisis continues: on 24 March, the parliamentary session to elect a President was postponed for the 17th time since November 2007.
The Summit of the Arab League in Damascus has not delivered a solution either.
While the security situation has remained relatively calm with no major incidents, public tension and anxiety have increased.
Violence could break out at any moment as the political crisis goes on, with unforeseeable consequences for the country and its people.
Indications that Hizbollah has replenished its military capacity since 2006 are worrying, especially in the light of the recent threats against Israel, following the death of Imad Mugniyeh.
Moreover, the protracted crisis is having a very negative impact on the socio-economic situation in Lebanon.
As you are aware, Europe is active at many different levels to help Lebanon: we remain the biggest contributor to UNIFIL, and the European Union has also been the most important donor at the Paris III Conference.
We have been firmly supporting the Arab League's Initiative since it was launched in January 2008 and our Community instruments have allowed us to provide a targeted response to some of the major challenges.
The European Neighbourhood Policy has developed into a major instrument to support Lebanon's reform process and to contribute to economic and social stabilisation, even though reform efforts are severely hampered by the current political stalemate.
What are our priorities for the immediate future?
Continued support for the implementation of the Arab League Initiative remains our key priority.
Despite all difficulties, this initiative enjoys broad support and it represents for the moment the only option to find a solution.
An important date in the process will be 22 April, when the next presidential election session in the Parliament is scheduled.
The idea of a special Lebanon Summit within the Arab League framework has recently been floated.
If it materialises, we should see how we can best provide support for this initiative.
We should note, however, that it is Syria that currently holds the Presidency of the Arab League.
A clear and continued commitment to the full implementation of the Security Council resolutions relevant to Lebanon also remains essential, indeed crucial.
The publication of the next implementation reports on UN Security Council Resolutions 1559 and 1701 - in May and July 2007 respectively - will therefore be essential milestones.
We should also continue efforts to maintain momentum in the Middle East peace process, which has an impact on Lebanon.
I remain in close contact with my Quartet partners and am looking forward to the Middle East conference planned by the European Parliament later this year.
<D>
rapporteur. - Mr President, the potential for carbon capture and storage technology to achieve vast reductions and abatement in CO2 emissions into the atmosphere is something we simply must grasp.
I have to say that the idea of storing CO2 underground forever is not my ideal option.
I would like us to move straight to a different age, one where our power comes from renewable, clean and green forms of energy.
But we cannot ignore the reality of coal.
China is getting 80% of its electricity from coal.
It is soaring ahead with renewable energy programmes and, yet, it is also expanding its coal-fired power stations week in, week out.
In my own country there is a big argument about building one new coal-fired power station at Kingsnorth.
The CO2 emissions from that one power station will be the equivalent of those saved by every single wind-farm we currently have in the country.
People will say: why bother with all these renewables, why bother with all these other things if you are still building coal-fired power stations in this way?
We have to develop CCS.
The International Energy Agency says that by 2050 it could be responsible for abating up to 50% of the emissions that would otherwise take place on a business-as-usual scenario.
Now our number one concern in dealing with this legislation has been to deal with the issue of safety.
Some of those concerns may be easy to exaggerate.
After all, CO2 is natural: we breathe it in, we breathe it out.
We pump an explosive gas like methane into our own homes, where we set light to it.
So, by comparison, CO2 needs to be put into perspective.
But we have tried to address the issue of leakage in this report, making clear that it is absolutely unacceptable if there was a risk to human health.
We have tried to improve the regulation, introducing clarifications to avoid contradictions and to speed up the application process, while emphasising that Member States are ultimately in charge of their own destiny.
They decide whether or not CO2 will be stored on their territory.
The Commission's initial proposals were good.
I hope that Council, Commission and Parliament have collectively improved upon them.
But there is not much point in storing CO2 - or making provisions for the storage of CO2 - if we are not capturing it in the first place.
So we took on the challenge, over the past few months, of introducing a financial mechanism to drive forward construction of the demonstration projects promised by heads of government last year.
I have to say that at times it has felt like an uphill struggle.
People were dubious about the proposal to use allowances from the New Entrant Reserve of the Emissions Trading Scheme.
But we got there in the end, with the Council deciding last week to allocate 300 million allowances.
How much that will raise depends on the carbon price.
But I am told it could be anything from EUR 6 billion to EUR 9 billion of support for capital investment.
That is a major step forward - one of the real achievements of these negotiations.
I think all my colleagues in this Chamber should be pleased that the proposal came initially from Parliament.
It was on the Council's agenda because we placed it there.
The presidency took it and, if not with enthusiasm, it at least accepted that it offered a solution to a very real problem.
Let us now go forward.
Let us see these demonstration projects put out to tender as soon as possible.
Let us see construction begin.
Let us test this technology and let us pray that it works.
<D>
(SK) The Slovak Republic applies a high standard in relation to ethnic minorities and, at the same time, one of the most moderate national language laws in Europe.
Despite this, it is under permanent pressure from Hungarian Members who do not hesitate to employ lies and fabrications in order to influence European public opinion.
We have witnessed this at almost every session of the European Parliament since its expansion in 2004.
Hungary is a country that has almost completely eliminated minorities in its own territory and is attempting a gross intervention in the affairs of the Slovak Republic.
This is totally unacceptable.
I believe that the European institutions will not charge into this affair like a bull in a china shop.
Slovakia will resolve problems relating to use of the national language by cultural means and in accordance with European traditions.
The implementing regulation for the amendment to the language law confirms the sensitive approach to all of the ethnic groups and nationalities living in Slovakia.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, nobody can underestimate the importance of water and the need to manage our water sources well.
However, as I said in my introductory remarks, we also need to assist the poorer parts of the world in gaining access to clean drinking water.
The Commission will continue to assist these countries.
Water is a primary human need, as was recognised and reaffirmed during the Fourth Water Forum in Mexico in 2006.
Of course, as I said before, the EU will be represented and will put forward a strong case on all the points I have made at the forthcoming Forum in Istanbul.
Mr Bowis referred to another very important question - and I agree with him - namely that, because of climate change, we see other parts of the world being flooded with water.
We really have to take action about that.
As he said very clearly, forestation is one of the solutions to the problem.
<D>
(PL) In times of crisis, when the integrity of the European Union is under threat, we should, in supporting economic growth, pay particular attention to the cohesion of the Union.
We still do not know if the crisis will act to deepen the differences between different regions of Europe.
Historical differences in the level of development of regions may grow, and we may also witness the appearance of new differentiating factors.
In this situation, what is particularly needed are mechanisms which reduce differences between regions, and continuation of strong regional policy is the way to achieve this objective.
It would be unwise, in this situation, to give up this policy and reduce significantly the financing available to local and regional authorities, for this would pose a serious threat to the stimulation of economic growth, but would also be a threat to European unity as such.
Both the Europe 2020 strategy and Cohesion policy aim to achieve the same goal.
They have a crucial effect on economic revival and huge significance for European solidarity policy.
However, what is needed is better coordination between them.
Creating new and separate thematic funds to respond to new challenges would be a waste of time and money, and would also delay realisation of the 2020 strategy and condemn it to the fate of the Treaty of Lisbon.
We must ensure the financing of key infrastructure projects and reject the renationalisation of regional policy.
At the moment, we often hear of strong pressure from governments of certain Member States and also from the European Commission to cut or reduce expenditure on regional policy.
However, the message of the European Parliament in the report, of which I was shadow rapporteur, is clear.
We need stronger, not weaker, Cohesion policy.
We need true European solidarity.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, my justification is as follows.
Unfortunately, no plenary debate, the result of which we could have taken to the trialogue, was held on ETS.
Trialogue negotiations merely on the basis of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety are not representative of Parliament.
Now, we are supposed to endorse the amendments to the Commission's proposal; but what we are supposed to be deciding on today matches the Council paper one-to-one.
There is not a single alteration by Parliament, even so much as a comma.
What is the reason for this time pressure?
After all, we are talking about a period from 2013 onwards.
With the ETS proposal in its current form, inconsistencies and ballooning costs will catch up with us.
The subject of emissions trading is the most important industrial policy decision for years, if not decades, to come.
We are not prepared to hand in our democratic right of codecision at the Parliament cloakroom.
After all, what is it that many Members have successfully fought for in this House for almost 30 years?
Have they fought to see climate policy left almost entirely to the Council through a simplified procedure?
As an elected parliament, we wish to engage in democratic debate and to do so specifically in view of the consequences of our actions.
Thank you very much.
<D>
rapporteur. - (EL) Mr President, the 29 European regulatory agencies constitute what at first sight appear to be micro-institutions but which, in essence, have an obvious macro-impact and which have already become an accepted para-institutional component of the European Union.
The excessive increase in the number of regulatory agencies has undoubtedly resulted in inflated European regulatory intervention, the fragmentation of and a lack of transparency in European policies and, by extension, has made operational coordination more difficult.
For all European agencies, the urgent question arises of the need for an interim review of their work and performance.
What is required is a minimum total of common principles and rules relating to the structure, operation and control of the regulatory agencies, so that they integrate harmoniously within the framework of fundamental principles which derive from the Treaties.
Following the Council's refusal to accept a legally binding instrument and the rejection of the proposal to conclude an interinstitutional agreement, the Commission decided to propose the establishment of an interinstitutional working group tasked with drawing up a common framework for the regulatory institutions and defining the competence of each of the European institutions vis-à-vis those agencies.
I consider that this proposal falls short of the European Parliament's expectations of achieving an interinstitutional agreement.
The common approach is indeed an interim step towards the adoption of a legally binding text.
I do, of course, appreciate the Commission's wish to find a way out of a situation of protracted interinstitutional inertia.
The setting up of an interinstitutional working group which will carry out a collective policy review of the experience gained from the activities of the regulatory agencies and whose mandate will be to clarify their position in the multilevel system of European governance is welcome.
The proposed approach - a common approach as far as possible - to the structure and workings of the agencies concerned seeks to restrict bureaucratic rigidity so that they can play their regulatory role correctly and effectively and can be supervised and so that the current requirements for auditing and accountability can, at least partially, be satisfied.
The priority of seeking a common framework for an interinstitutional understanding and approach lies in maximising the added value of the regulatory agencies in the European structures of governance in general by creating greater transparency, visible democratic control and improved efficiency.
Finally, I should like to point out that the establishment of parliamentary control over the structure and the work of the regulatory agencies is consistent with the classic democratic principle requiring political responsibility of any body wielding executive power.
The possibility of the European Parliament assigning political responsibility to the agencies concerned touches on a core principle of representative democracy, which consists in examining the legality and expediency of the choices made by the executive power.
<D>
in writing. - (PT) With regard to the second round of talks on a new partnership and cooperation agreement between the European Union and Vietnam, which were held yesterday and the day before that in Hanoi, a majority of this Parliament has adopted a resolution which seems more like an exercise in hypocrisy and instrumentalisation of human rights.
On reading its content, we could question why this majority in Parliament has not also proposed making the future agreement dependent on a clause ensuring respect for democracy and human rights on the part of the EU.
How useful and educational it would be for the EP, for example, to 'ask' the Member States and the EU to refrain from collaborating with and/or whitewashing the criminal CIA flights, to respect the human rights of immigrants, flagrantly violated in the 'return directive', to respect the democratically and sovereignly expressed will of the French, Dutch and Irish people who rejected the proposed 'Constitutional'/'Lisbon' Treaty, to respect international law, particularly with regard to Kosovo, and to stop pretending that they can give lessons to the world ...
What would happen if Vietnam were doing all this?
Would the EP agree to negotiate under those conditions?
Would it agree to reciprocally apply this clause?
Obviously not, because 'dialogue' and the 'clause' are only for others ...
<D>
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Madam President, the text before this House is the result of collective work by the Climate Committee.
That committee, set up on ad hoc basis with a mandate of great importance, has undertaken major consultation and discussion initiatives, and has drawn up an instrument which Europe can use to play a major role in the thirteenth Conference of the Parties in Bali.
The crux of the policy proposal is clear and forceful.
What is needed is a political and multilateral approach which is based on the UN, and takes account of the IPCC and major changes not just in technology but also in the social model.
Technology transfers, cooperation and a new environmental and development approach are needed.
The proposal of 3.20% by the Commission and the Council is only a starting point in this sense, albeit a positive one.
Our thinking needs to be wide-ranging and forward-looking, and frankly the future cannot involve a return to technologies of the past which are old, dangerous and controversial, such as nuclear technology.
We also need to start thinking about innovative proposals that we ourselves have put forward in our parliamentary debate and which are now being taken up in a more authoritative way by leading figures such as Chancellor Merkel.
I am speaking of the per capita calculation of emissions, which we have proposed, together with Mr Prodi, and which is very important in the light of the current situation in which there now seems to be an inequality in emissions and in which those emissions all have to be reduced in an egalitarian way.
<D>
The common position on working time that the Council put to the vote by Parliament was a real step backwards for workers' rights and a genuine threat to our European social model.
Gathering a strong majority behind him, the socialist rapporteur, Mr Cercas, whom I supported with my vote, has managed to bring down this conservative and reactionary vision of the world of work, which is worthy of the 19th century.
Along with all socialists, I supported a series of amendments that guarantee essential advances for workers' rights.
We have thus obtained the repeal of the opt-out clause, which allowed people to break away from the limit on working time and impose up to 65 working hours per week.
Similarly, because we cannot consider on-call time as rest time, we have enabled it to be counted as working time.
We have also obtained guarantees with regard to compensatory rest time and the reconciling of family and professional life.
This great victory of the European socialists, supported by the unions, is a victory for all Europeans.
The Europe that embraces the major social advances such as those today is the Europe that protects its people.
<D>
The Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left voted against this report on speculative funds.
Despite its number of pages and the energy that its rapporteur seems to have put into it, this report is incredibly weak.
Its content is really no match for the challenges we have to face.
The proposals announced are even frequently at odds with what ought to be done to prevent a repeat of the subprime financial crisis of autumn 2008.
The report will therefore not enable the European Parliament to put pressure on the Commission and the Council to make them stop this budgetary restraint policy that is gradually destroying all our social policy instruments.
This is a bad signal to be sending out on the eve of the G20 summit chaired by Nicolas Sarkozy.
<D>
(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, as my fellow Members who signed the oral question have emphasised and as distinguished speakers stated in greater detail at the public hearing in Brussels last week, we all need to look on public-sector television as a medium for supplying a service to our citizens which will, to a great extent, coincide with the obligation to operate it.
The public dialogue, the independent supervisory authority and the diversity of programmes, in keeping with the history and culture of each Member State, need to be protected in the wake of the development of new technologies and the host of companies that spring up on a daily basis.
Within the framework of healthy competition, the Commission needs to promote new ways of protecting the public interest and public broadcasting.
Mainly, the definition of the public mission of broadcasters needs to be made clear; we need a better evaluation of state aid but also, as regards the rule of transparency, we must not impose pointless administrative and financial burdens on the Member States and public broadcasters in the ex-ante evaluation carried out by the Commission.
More effective control mechanisms also need to be adopted in the new mass media environment.
Furthermore, given that public broadcasts play a decisive role in cultural and linguistic diversity, all these media, as well as the public corporations and public television, are obliged to provide quality programmes and, at the same time, within the framework of competition with other similar bodies, they must be able to respond positively to the challenges of the times by broadcasting events of global interest, such as the Olympic Games, the World Cup and so on.
Unfortunately nowadays this is something that tends to be prevented simply by reason of the fact that, as private companies have more money, public television cannot afford them.
Consequently, citizens will not be able to watch these events alongside other programmes.
To finish, I should also like to point out that what is currently available on the market and the interests of commercial media in defining the scope of the competence and activity of public broadcasters is not, by the same token, conducive to the more general interest, with of course a few exceptions, and the Commission needs to take serious account of that fact.
<D>
Mr President, any health check needs measurement and assessment.
For the CAP, I suggest that the measure is funding and that the assessors are the auditors.
Does the Court of Auditors find the CAP to be healthy, when 28.9% of single farm payments are erroneous?
Does it find it healthy for the CAP to fund farmers not to grow food?
Does it find it healthy to turn farmland over to biofuels, just when there is a world shortage of cereals?
Does it find the CAP healthy when genuine farmers - in the UK at least - are struggling to make a living?
Does it know that farmers in New Zealand are not now subsidised but are doing very well and that only 3% of them went under when subsidies were withdrawn?
Since it sounds to me that the CAP is very unhealthy, is it not time to turn off the life-support machine and let European farmers make their own way?
<D>
Mr President, following on from Ms McGuinness's reference to the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty in Ireland, I comment that in my own country, the United Kingdom, good progress is being made in both Houses of Parliament and it is anticipated that the United Kingdom will ratify the Treaty in good order shortly.
I do not wish to score points against political opponents, but it was disappointing to those British Conservatives who favour the Treaty that the British Liberal Party abstained.
However, I am sure Mr Watson could explain the reasons for that.
At this Spring Council there will presumably be reference to the recent change of government in Russia.
It is very important - and increasingly in this House - that the European Union has a common foreign policy with regard to the Russian Federation and to some of the proposals, for example the Nord Stream pipeline.
Again, I do not want to anticipate, as this House will be debating the Russian elections on Thursday.
However, the motion for a resolution, which apparently we will be able to approve, raises concerns about the treatment of the electoral observers and about what happened to those opposition candidates denied the ability to stand in those elections, and calls for the immediate release of some 50 demonstrators who were arrested in a violent way by Russian Interior Ministry men.
I hope the Council will take this extremely seriously.
Obviously, we wish to congratulate President Medvedev and Prime Minister Putin.
We look for good and harmonious relations, but we cannot have them if this House and this European Union is divided.
Germans, Dutch, British, Poles - all of us - must have a common view about our relations with the Russian Federation and about how we go about ensuring the energy supply.
We do not have to approve Nord Stream; we might well approve the Amber pipeline.
I look forward with great interest to the Council's conclusions in relation to the EU common foreign policy and common foreign energy policy, and in particular to good relations with the Russian Federation.
<D>
(LT) The battle against the harmful effects of alcohol is as old as time.
The Dry Law and various prohibitions that were applied in some countries did not produce positive results.
However, the Commission Communication on an EU strategy to support Member States in reducing alcohol related harm is a very important initiative.
The Commission, having generalised the experience of the Member States and identified the problems common to them all, has introduced the priorities for reducing alcohol-related harm.
It is believed that implementation of the important priorities introduced, such as the protection of young people, children and unborn babies, the prevention of drinking when driving and other restrictions will make our society more responsible, healthy and abstemious.
I wish to emphasise the huge risks faced by young people drinking alcohol.
It is sad, but the permissible age for drinking alcohol is getting lower and lower in many countries.
Good practice is therefore very important.
I would like to propose linking the practice of reducing alcohol related harm in young people to EU programmes for young people.
The development and implementation of such programmes would help to occupy their leisure time and help to protect them from malignant alcohol consumption.
<D>
Mr President, I will stick specifically to agriculture.
First of all, I have to admit that I am a farmer but I do not have pigs, I do not have poultry, though I do have a greenhouse in the garden.
I think it is very important that the Commissioner realises that, as has already been said, it is specifically designed for industry.
Commissioner, I beg that you rethink the situation when it comes to the directives on agriculture.
We already know that agriculture is under huge pressure.
We have heard many times in this Chamber the question of food security.
Please reconsider the amendments which are particularly damaging to it.
I think that many of the amendments that are not connected with agriculture are extremely good and I congratulate Mr Vernola on his report.
Commissioner, you talked in your presentation about distorting competition.
I am going to ask you a simple question, and please try to answer it today.
Will you put in place legislation to stop imports of foodstuffs coming into the European Union which are not reared to the same standards as we have in the European Union?
<D>
My sincere thanks, President of the European Council, Janez Janša, for your report.
However, not only do I wish to thank you on behalf of Parliament, but I should also like to offer you my personal thanks.
I should like to add - and this is also a very personal comment - that, when I was first elected to the European Parliament in 1979, I would not have thought that we would see the day when the Prime Minister of Slovenia - a free, democratic Slovenia - would report to this House on the European Council, and yet, here we are!
What I would like to say is this: it is a miracle of our time that the Prime Minister of Slovenia has spoken in this House on behalf of the European Union.
We would also draw from this courage and strength at a time when a mood of disappointment has pervaded the debate because of the referendum in Ireland.
What is important is that progress will continue to be made if we remain determined.
I should like to thank you sincerely for your determination.
I can assure you, on behalf of the European Parliament, that we shall remain determined.
We shall remain patient but also determined, and, on that basis, may I now ask the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, to make his concluding remarks.
Many thanks once again, President Janša!
<D>
The international situation has recently been changing ever more rapidly.
The rising economic importance of Asia, the revolutionary movements in Africa, the increased terrorist threat, the need to establish joint and sustainable European raw materials strategies and ever more frequent violations of human rights are just a few of the problems with which EU diplomacy has to contend today.
Experience has taught us that it is powerless in many cases.
The European Union's foreign policy appears to be poorly thought-out and poorly coordinated.
Furthermore, the idea of joint and sustainable European policies has lost out on more than one occasion to the interests of the largest countries of the 'old' EU.
A perfect example of this is the lack of a rule ensuring geographical balance when filling posts in the European External Action Service.
This system needs to be changed, and it was for this reason that I did not support the Muñiz De Urquiza report.
I believe that it identifies key conditions which the EU and the Member States should meet in order to be able to perform better the tasks enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon.
However, we should not endeavour to replace NATO with a new EU army, but instead concentrate on the appropriate division of tasks during international crises.
The EU's role could lie in the provision of humanitarian aid, while the North Atlantic Alliance would coordinate military aid.
This distribution of tasks could also make it possible to strengthen cooperation with the EU's most important trade and military partner, namely the United States.
<D>
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, my group had a vigorous debate about this compromise resolution yesterday.
On some essential points, it deviates from the text that we as the Socialist Group in the European Parliament originally contributed.
By this I do not mean in any way to call the negotiations into question or to minimise negotiators' success in achieving a compromise resolution with the other groups, but there is one element that we cannot get through, but which plays a key role in our resolution.
Even though this element, which I will name in a minute, is no longer included in the text, our group has decided to vote in favour of the compromise resolution because we believe that it is important that the European Parliament sends a unified signal.
However, I want to make it clear here that we would very much have liked to see President Saakashvili's aggressive attitude restrained and also, at the start of the conflict, a firm hold put on a totally inappropriate ...
(Protests from the right and applause from the left)
We would have liked to have seen what happened at the start included in this resolution, if only to make it plain that the very people who are protesting so loudly here now are the same people who want to intensify the conflicts rather than reduce them.
(Applause from the left and protests from the right)
<D>
Madam President, the initial goals of the Lisbon Strategy committed the EU to creating a knowledge economy, an innovative economy, a digital economy, by the year 2010.
Well, I have news for us all here in this packed Chamber: we are running out of time.
You may not have noticed, but we have made very little progress so far.
Before I became a politician, I used to work with a lot of innovators and help lots of start-up companies.
It was a real contrast, coming to the world of European politics, to see how we dealt with innovation.
When we deal with innovation here, we have committees, we have strategy documents, we have votes, we have everything but innovation, unless you consider more paper creation to be innovation.
When you talk to the innovators out there, the people who are going to create wealth in the European Union and across the globe, what they want is for governments to keep out of the way.
It is time the looters of government stopped draining the life-blood of companies.
<D>
in writing. - I voted for this report, not because I consider that the Lisbon Treaty amendments offer the way to a European Union which is firmly based on a commitment to sustainable development, peace and human rights rather than the market and competition, but because I consider it does have factors which are more positive than our current Treaty arrangements.
The Charter of Fundamental Rights is an important addition.
All EU legislation and its implementation at Member State level will now have to be checked against the Charter and can be challenged if it falls short.
Greater codecision will mean more scrutiny and more daylight in the decision-making process.
The Citizens' Initiative is an important step forward.
I have grave concerns about greater military cooperation, which is already under way, and want our national and European Parliament to closely scrutinise this development.
It is crucial that the EU builds on its strengths as a diplomatic and peace-building power.
I believe it is important that EU citizens are involved in the ratification process through referendums and that those results should be respected.
It is the task of governments and the Council to respond practically to that general principle, not this Parliament.
<D>
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, paragraph 41 of the report reads: 'urges that under no circumstances should European space policy contribute to the militarisation and weaponisation of space'.
So far so good.
Yet the entire report contradicts that statement.
It actually lists military measures.
Paragraph 5, for instance, states that there is a need for telecommunications, information management, observation and navigation in the military area.
The report even underlines the necessity of the Galileo satellite project, which is quite clearly a civilian project, for autonomous ESDP operations.
I am grateful to Mr Verheugen for clarifying the budgetary aspects again.
The European Union's current Treaty provides quite clearly that the EU budget cannot be used for military purposes.
That is why the GUE/NGL Group has tabled amendments to rectify the legal situation, to the effect that space may be used only for explicitly civilian purposes and that Galileo is an explicitly civilian project.
Looking at the other amendments tabled, it is interesting to see how contradictory some of them are.
My favourite was the amendment by the Greens, which begins by stressing that Galileo must remain a space project for civilian purposes and continues by nonetheless acknowledging its importance for autonomous ESDP operations.
That is clearly a contradiction in terms.
We should make it quite clear that the issue here is the militarisation of space by the European Union.
It is easy to keep pointing the finger at others who are (also) pursuing the militarisation of space.
Such military use is precisely what we do not want to see!
That is why the content of this report, taken as a whole, as it is worded, is wrong, because it calls for precisely that militarisation.
We reject that.
We want space to be used for civilian purposes and want Galileo to remain a purely civilian project.
We have now shifted the burden onto the taxpayer - EUR 3.4 billion - with this latest call for tender.
We keep saying we want a system that is independent of the USA, but now Boeing is clearly interested in this tender, so that does not seem quite true any more either.
We want the purely civilian use of space, no militarisation!
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, we are also looking forward to continuing to work closely with the Czech Presidency, the Czech Government and specifically with Minister Martin Bursík.
I am sure that during the first semester of 2009 we will advance the negotiations considerably.
I would like to thank all the speakers in today's discussion for their positive contributions.
As the title of your report indicates, what happens to the world's climate in 2015 and beyond will depend on what action the international community decides now.
Building on the solid scientific advice at our disposal, and insisting that negotiations must be guided by science, remains vital.
We need to communicate the scientific findings to a broader public, and enhance consumer awareness of greenhouse gas impacts on lifestyles and consumption patterns.
Such increased awareness, however, needs to be accompanied by strong economic incentives for business to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the goods and services they provide.
A transition to a low-carbon economy is needed at a global scale, and can only be achieved through comprehensive and integrated action to address emissions in all sectors.
Only by being ambitious now can we keep the door open to stabilising concentrations of greenhouse gases at lower levels, should the IPCC in future indicate that this is necessary.
Together with the Commission, I am convinced that you also have an important role in echoing these important messages.
2009 will be a crucial year for the global climate change negotiations.
For the Commission, 2009 will be a year of implementation: we are working on an implementation road map.
There are about 15 measures that we need to take through comitology; there is a list of deadlines in the revised ETS that we are going to meet: for example, the list of sectors for carbon leakage should be ready by December 2009.
There will be a big stakeholders' meeting on 30 March 2009.
The bulk of the work will be done during the summer and, by the end of 2009, we shall have this list dealt with.
The harmonised rules on auctioning should be ready by June 2010.
There will be a big stakeholders' meeting in February, and all these deadlines and work programmes are available to you.
But 2009, as I said, is going to be a crucial year for the global climate change negotiations.
The world is expected to agree on further international action to tackle climate change at the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference in December.
However, a deal in Copenhagen is by no means a given: much work remains to be done.
The climate change and energy package gave us a head start in this transition and provided an excellent basis to prove that ambitious climate policy is not only possible but also broadly beneficial to our economies and societies.
The Copenhagen Communication is the basis for further elaborating the European Union's positions on those key elements, enabling us to maintain our leadership and help lead the negotiations to a success in Copenhagen.
It is clear that the climate change challenge cannot be solved without significantly stepping up the financing of, and investment in, clean technology, as well as measures to adapt to the inevitable climate change impacts.
Required amounts for developing countries are estimated to go up to EUR 120-150 billion annually in 2020.
Until 2020, this financing can, for a large part, come from the private-sector households in developing countries.
For instance, the major part of reductions in the energy sector will come from efficiency improvements that will pay for themselves.
These may partly be supported by international loan arrangements in order to mobilise international private finance.
Another significant part of additional financing and investment will be mobilised through the carbon market, both from the proceeds of the future auctioning of carbon allowances and via carbon credits under the CDM.
The European Union in its climate and energy package has created significant demand for CDM credits until 2020.
This is likely to spur the deployment of clean technologies in developing countries.
However, the poorer the developing countries are, the more they will require further public financial assistance from developed countries.
Without this assistance they will not be able to sufficiently reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.
Without this assistance the poorest and most vulnerable will suffer the consequences of climate change.
Without this assistance there will be no deal in Copenhagen.
The question is: how can we make sure that these additional public financial flows will be predictable, be spent transparently and effectively, and that the contributions to those flows will be shared internationally?
In addition to our contributions to the United Nations negotiations, we see that, following the success of the European Union's emissions trading system, carbon markets are being established in many parts of the world.
Australia has announced the core elements of its system.
In autumn 2008, shortly after his election, US President Obama reaffirmed his goal to create a US-wide carbon market.
Together, these trading systems could form the nucleus of an evolving future global carbon market.
As I have already stressed, the European Union's challenge now is to facilitate the development of such linked carbon markets, in particular among OECD countries by 2015.
In the Copenhagen Communication, the Commission has addressed these questions by putting forward concrete proposals - proposals that are not only ambitious but also realistic, and will make a significant contribution to the success in Copenhagen that our planet so desperately needs.
Let me conclude by taking this opportunity to thank the Temporary Committee on Climate Change, Mr Florenz and Parliament for their strong support for our proposals and for the seriousness and speed with which they have handled the package.
(Applause)
<D>
(PL) Mr President, the Council regulation represents a further attempt to achieve a balance between the current state of knowledge concerning the actual state of resources and the natural desire to discharge the obligations relating to the stewardship and management of European fisheries.
The rapporteur has clearly identified the new manifestation of this age-old dilemma.
He has pointed to a clear contradiction between the noble intention of protecting resources and the actual possibilities of establishing their state.
On this occasion, the authors of the regulation agree as never before with the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries that there is still a lack of sufficiently reliable information to be passed to fishermen in the form of comprehensible opinions on the TAC.
At the same time, however, the Union's institutions, doubtless not wishing to be seen as inactive, are recommending development of provisions ensuring consistent implementation of the TAC, even when, as stated, the data is known to be inadequate.
Fishermen expecting verification of fishing effort perceive this approach as being unduly cautious and as inappropriate in terms of a rational fisheries policy.
I have endeavoured to try and understand the peculiar methodology adopted by those in authority in this area.
Nonetheless, I feel it incumbent upon me to caution the rapporteur regarding the social and economic consequences of a proliferation of limitations on catches, and of irritating and bureaucratic restrictions on the activities of fishermen.
Increasingly, the latter are supporting scientists as regards establishing the true state of the marine biomass.
Polish fishermen have joined the increasing criticism of the archaic data base that is too heavily based on estimates.
Now is perhaps the time to take greater heed of fishermen's opinions, based on centuries of knowledge and an awareness that fishermen can only survive if they respect the interests of the marine environment.
<D>
Mr President, as British Conservatives, we are generally strong protagonists of open markets, but, as a number of speakers have confirmed, the underlying thrust of this report is strengthening ESDP and EU integration rather than any real economic benefits.
It certainly has nothing to do with strengthening defence capabilities.
I can see that there could be some marginal benefits in easier UK access to some other European countries' markets in defence-related procurement.
But there is a far greater advantage for others to access the UK market, which has the largest defence spend - and, by the way, the UK already has the most open defence procurement market in Europe.
Of particular concern is that, under the proposed rules, a government or firm that has made huge investment in some aspect of defence R&D may no longer be in a position to recoup this investment in the development and production phase.
Development contracts are expected to be opened up to European competition, leaving a national government with no means of protecting intellectual property, jobs or export opportunities.
It will be a brake on R&D.
There are other concerns as well, but I have to say that this report is not really necessary from a defence, industrial or, indeed, economic point of view.
<D>
(SL) I think the resolution which was prepared by the Committee on Climate Change reflects the essential decisions of the Bali negotiations as well as the opinion of the European Parliament.
My evaluation of the Bali timetable, i.e. the deadline for concluding the agreement for post-2012, is very positive.
Only a clear working plan can secure continuity after expiry of the Kyoto Protocol, for which this Parliament has constantly striven.
I am pleased that the developing countries also undertook part of the responsibility for reducing CO2 emissions and committed themselves to sustainable development.
That, of course, means strengthened international cooperation in the field of financial and human resources.
I truly hope that the existing and currently implemented mechanisms in Europe, such as the carbon market, will be successfully translated at international level.
However, we must simplify them and prevent them from becoming a disproportionate bureaucratic burden in relation to their potential advantages.
Only in that way can we expect to succeed in reaching the set targets.
I see the current situation primarily as an opportunity.
I see successful, sustainable development depending mainly on increased research capabilities.
For example, the global investment in research into the energy supply has been reduced by 40% since the 1980s.
The situation in the European Union is not much better.
We need more money and more educated and creative people.
I congratulate the negotiators from the European Union and I hope that, in future, we will always be represented by such persistent, sharp and successful negotiators.
Finally, I would like to say that, usually, when it comes to climate change all eyes turn towards politicians, but action in the field of climate change does not involve politicians alone.
This is a time for a fruitful reaction from industry, business people and researchers.
<D>
The next item is Question Time (B7-0563/2010).
The following questions are addressed to the Commission.
Subject: Young people in precarious employment
As the Commission notes in its communication 'Youth on the move', young people are often trapped in a chain of temporary employment contracts that reduces their chances of moving on to more stable contracts and exacerbates their job insecurity.
The problem is even more acute in Member States where labour law is particularly protectionist.
Can the Commission answer the following questions:
Does it believe that the often doubtful quality and uncontrolled duration of traineeships exacerbate this problem?
Will it take specific action as part of the objectives set in the Europe 2020 strategy and the Youth on the Move programme to support youth employment and strengthen their job security?
Will the Commission pursue specific and even more targeted policies to promote and strengthen youth employment in those Member States that are facing an economic recession?
<D>
(LT) Today we have voted in favour of the resolution, drawn up on basis of the report by Mr Cornillet, on a European Consensus on Humanitarian Aid.
I would like to thank the rapporteur and confirm once again my approval of this important document.
We are well aware of the fact that the European Union - and here I am thinking of the Commission and the Member States - is the leading provider of humanitarian aid.
The EU contribution for 2006 amounted to only EUR 2 billion.
I completely agree with the opinion that the EU should determine where to set the limit for the new level of humanitarian aid.
On the other hand, the EU has to define its position in view of the new international initiatives and the implementation of the reform initiated by the United Nations.
As a member of the Committee on Budgets, I would like to point out the third problem that the EU needs to solve, namely improving the coordination of Community and Member States' resources with a view to making them easily accessible for the victims of humanitarian disasters.
I hope that Parliament's concrete and precise position will facilitate the achievement of our common objectives and help find consensus on the subject of humanitarian aid.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, recalling our excellent cooperation on the Western Balkans, I want to thank you for the opportunity to inform Parliament on the Commission's standpoint on the Kosovo status process.
Kosovo's Assembly declared independence last Sunday in a climate of dignity.
In its declaration, Kosovo committed itself to fully respecting extensive rights for Kosovo Serbs, especially with regard to local self-government in education, culture and health, in line with the comprehensive proposal presented by UN Special Envoy Martti Ahtisaari.
Celebrations in Kosovo took place in a joyful but responsible manner.
However, there have been acts of violence in Belgrade and North Kosovo.
We condemn the use of violence and call on all leaders and people of the region to remain calm and maintain peace and stability.
As Foreign Minister Rupel explained, the EU Foreign Ministers on Monday responded to developments in a united way.
European unity is indeed essential to enable the European Union to successfully steer the ongoing stabilisation in the Western Balkans and to help bring the Kosovo status process to a conclusion.
After the prolonged talks in the United Nations Security Council failed, the European Union was bound to steer the process to a conclusion.
The Union has already taken the essential decisions to send an ESDP rule of law mission to Kosovo.
On Monday, the Council also provided a platform for dealing with recognition.
It will be up to each EU Member State individually to establish relations with Kosovo in accordance with its national procedures.
Several Member States have already recognised Kosovo.
I expect most of the others to follow suit, at their own pace.
The Council rightly reiterated the EU's adherence to the principles of the UN Charter and the CSCE Helsinki Final Act and to all UN Security Council resolutions.
It underlined that 'in view of the conflict of the 1990s and the extended period of international administration, Kosovo constitutes a sui generis case which does not call into question these principles'.
The Commission fully shares this position.
In line with Monday's Council conclusions, the Commission stands ready to provide its full support to the EU's effort in Kosovo.
This must be the hour of European unity also between the institutions.
By using Community instruments, the Commission will support institution-building in Kosovo and foster its political and economic development.
On 5 March, we shall propose concrete measures for the broader region in order to advance its European aspirations.
In Kosovo, many areas are in need of development, and we must strive together to help Kosovo to help itself, to stand on its own feet as quickly as possible.
In this context the Commission is working on organising a Donors' Conference that should help alleviate the most pressing financial challenges concerning Kosovo.
I expect the Conference to take place before the summer.
I know this is a difficult moment for Serbia.
I am very conscious of Kosovo's historical importance for the Serbian people.
However, I find that the time has come to turn the page on the past, and to look to the future.
And Serbia's future is in Europe.
Serbia and the whole region of the Western Balkans have a European perspective, with the ultimate goal of EU membership.
This EU perspective functions as the glue that keeps the countries of the region on a peaceful and reformist track, which is extremely important in these sensitive and difficult times.
Finally, I want to reiterate my appreciation for the unwavering support of the European Parliament for the EU perspective of the Western Balkans.
We count on your continuous support, so that the citizens of the region can fulfil their aspiration of becoming, one day, part of the European Union.
(Applause)
<D>
The Commission's annual report on the progress made by Turkey in 2008 as a candidate state is balanced.
Although the reform process should be given a boost and eight negotiating chapters are still blocked, the Commission has welcomed in particular Turkey's recent diplomatic activity and its role in promoting stability in the region.
The events of summer 2008 highlighted Turkey's strategic role, including in the energy sector.
In the area of regional cooperation, the constructive role which Turkey played in its relations with neighbouring countries and in the Middle East through active diplomacy was noted.
The developments in the Caucasus highlighted Turkey's strategic importance for the EU's energy security, especially through the diversification of transport routes.
The document emphasises the importance of close cooperation in the energy sector between the EU and Turkey, with the Nabucco project being a key element in this respect.
Following the initiation of negotiations between Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders on reaching an understanding on the Cypriot question, it is vital for Ankara to continue to support finding a solution, along with the efforts which the UN is making to this end.
The expansion of the EU and the continuing integration of Western Balkan states into the EU are priority dossiers for Romania.
Romania supports the substantial progress made in the negotiations with Turkey, a process which is dynamic enough to encourage internal reforms.
<D>
Mr President, Commissioner, I would prefer to use five minutes to start with and leave one minute for my conclusions.
The draft regulation sets out the conditions in terms of location, character, financial situation and professional competence which a person must fulfil to be able to perform the occupation of a road transport operator.
The regulation which we are discussing has also established the terms under which a company can employ a transport manager, has reinforced authorisation and monitoring procedures, has provided regulations for electronic registers and the protection of electronic data, has dealt with the issue of penalties for non-compliance with the regulation and has set up a system of mutual recognition of diplomas and prior rights.
At first reading, which ended with a plenary session vote in May last year, Parliament insisted that the transport manager have a proper contractual link to the company and imposed an upper limit on the number of vehicles one manager could manage.
Amendments were also introduced to tighten the requirements for the company to have a fixed location.
The company's good reputation may be lost as a result of its involvement in human or drugs trafficking.
Parliament has drawn up a list of serious infringements leading to exclusion from the profession in conjunction with removing provisions on minor infringements.
Insurance has been accepted as proof of financial standing and the quick ratio of assets to debts has been dropped.
A compulsory written examination in the country of residence has been retained as a requirement to practice this occupation, with the possibility of an exemption for 10 years' continuous practical experience.
Finally, previous rights have been rescinded and the Commission has been asked to report on the likely impact of extending the regulation to commercial transport using vehicles with the appropriate design and equipment, intended to carry up to nine persons including the driver.
The Common Position has adopted in whole or in substance 70 of Parliament's 113 amendments.
These include amendments on minor infringements, the definition of the link between companies and transport managers, the right of appeal of those subject to decisions on operating as a transport manager, mutual recognition of certificates, prior rights, the exchange of information between the competent authorities, as well as drugs and human trafficking as grounds for exclusion from the profession.
Concerning the registers, both Parliament and the Council agree on a stepwise approach.
In fact, the Commission will define the data structure for national electronic registers by the end of 2009, but the two institutions have proposed different timetables for implementation, with the Council requesting a longer period of time.
There have also been other issues where the Council's initial stance was different to that of Parliament, but after long, fruitful negotiations, an acceptable compromise was reached for both institutions.
As a result, Parliament has accepted a more flexible timetable for implementing and interconnecting national electronic registers (31 December 2012).
It has been agreed that major infringements will only be incorporated in national electronic registers after 2015, the limit on the period of validity for authorisation to perform the occupation of road transport operator will be removed, the examination will be retained in the Member State of residence, the structure of the electronic registers will include a public and a confidential section, the references in the regulation's content to restricting licences for accessing the road transport market will be removed, where virtually all the references to the licences for accessing the road transport market are only contained in Mr Grosch's two regulations.
I await fellow Members' comments with interest.
Thank you.
<D>
(ES) We have to acknowledge the fact, ladies and gentlemen, that there is a somewhat bittersweet flavour to today's debate and tomorrow's vote in this House, which have both a light and a dark side.
The dark side is that the intensity and speed of this procedure that we have undertaken have left a large number of Members of this House feeling cut off and excluded from much of the debate on a package of measures that we all know is surely the most important one in this parliamentary term.
On the light side, I am convinced that the outcome of these marathon negotiations is, we can finally say, satisfactory.
This is a joint debate on the whole package, but right now we are talking about the renewables directive, and I would like to highlight some points specifically about this subject.
First, it rightly keeps the proportion of biofuels at 10%, because if we have a problem in Europe it is the problem of security of supply.
The national support plans, which are continuing as well, have been very successful in certain Member States, particularly in Spain.
The fact that these are being maintained is, therefore, also very good news in my view.
The flexibility mechanisms are aimed at helping those Member States with less potential to take part in this ambitious project to boost renewables, by joining forces with those Member States that have great potential.
This too is a highly positive contribution.
Furthermore, this renewables directive is surely sending to Europe's industries a very strong, clear message that will encourage them to act with confidence and certainty.
That will open up huge business and job creation opportunities, both within Europe and globally.
In short, this package of legislation is opening up a new era of commitment to environmental quality of such size and scope ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
<D>
I abstained from the vote on further mobilisation of the Globalisation Adjustment Fund.
The vote concerns, among other things, two payments of almost EUR 24 million in total to the car industry in Sweden and Austria.
Another request concerns a construction company in the Netherlands.
The car industry is the main beneficiary of this fund, even though it is constantly closing factories, relocating its production, laying off a substantial amount of its workforce and placing its subcontractors in a vulnerable position.
In addition, it has received other types of financial aid from the Member States within the context of economic recovery plans, as well as other forms of support granted specifically in connection with the policies to combat climate change.
These funds, which are intended to be used to train people who have been made redundant - a necessary measure if they are to find a new job - are not being granted in return for a commitment by the European car industry not to lay off any more of its workers.
There is no question of my supporting a policy such as this, since it actually endorses relocations.
<D>
Ladies and gentlemen,
¡Bienvenido al Parlamento Europeo, señor Rodríguez Zapatero!
Es un gran placer contar con su presencia.
I would like to express my sincere thanks to you for accepting the European Parliament's invitation to attend this debate on the future of Europe, a debate which is a very significant one for this House.
Several Prime Ministers from around the European Union have already visited us to discuss the issues that are important for the future of the Union, including Guy Verhofstadt, Romano Prodi and Jan Peter Balkenende.
We have had an opportunity to listen to their views and debate matters with them, even at times when there was great uncertainty about the future course of the European Union.
Today, we are here in order to listen to you.
Based on a decision by the Conference of Presidents - the chairmen of the political groups - this form of debate will conclude with a speech by the Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt.
Prime Minister, I think it is important to mention that Spain was the first country, in 2005, to hold a referendum on what was then the draft Constitutional Treaty, and 77% of Spaniards voted in favour of this draft.
(Applause)
It is therefore a particular pleasure to be able to welcome you, Prime Minister, here today, shortly before the signing of the Treaty of Lisbon which comes after a long period of reflection and, indeed, crisis: a Treaty into which the substance of the Constitutional Treaty could be incorporated.
Spain is an important country within the European Union and has long made a valuable contribution to the European Union, not only since its accession in 1986 but long before then.
Spain has always demonstrated - and this applies to all the major parties - that it is a country with deeply held European convictions, a country which takes the initiative and is willing to show active commitment to the shared future of our continent.
The next item is the debate on the future of Europe with the participation of the Spanish Prime Minister and member of the European Council.
<D>
Muammar Gaddafi's departure is a matter of urgency today.
Yet there is everything else, too, and what matter are the people.
We focus on the dictators, but we often overlook the people, who are the first to suffer the consequences.
The process of liberating the Libyan people cannot be undertaken without a genuine political transition within the country.
However, a democratic transition will never succeed without real opposition leaders.
At the moment, that opposition is very weak.
Giving it greater visibility is a first necessary step towards creating momentum.
On the other hand, a strong regional strategy is also necessary.
On the refugee issue alone, the neighbouring countries cannot reach an agreement so as to prevent the influx of refugees from being held up at the borders.
The result: health conditions are worsening, which is fuelling intracommunity tensions.
If this humanitarian crisis is not tackled, we risk being faced with a situation that quickly spirals out of control.
<D>
The regulations for the application of the CAP 'health check' are a decisive step in the control of agricultural production by monopoly business groups, in the aim of increasing their profits.
At the same time, they are paving the way for an all-out attack in 2013 on small- and medium-sized enterprises, which have already been weakened.
Big business is exerting pressure for greater and faster reform of the CAP and for it to be adapted to the rules of the WTO, so that the multinationals can garner even more land, consolidate their sovereignty in the production and marketing of food and strengthen their position in international competition.
The consequences of the CAP are already visible to small- and medium-scale farmers, especially following the decoupling of aid from production in the 2003 reform: the abandonment of farms, the decline in the rural population, grubbing up, the abandonment of the countryside and adverse environmental effects.
They are also visible to workers, who face the unbearable cost of higher prices for foodstuffs and increased risks to public health arising from dangerous substances and dubious raw materials and production methods.
We are radically opposed to the proposed regulations, which reveal the anti-rural character of the CAP.
We call on small- and medium-scale farmers to join with the workers in the common fight against the anti-rural policy of the EU and capital.
(Written explanation cut short in application of Rule 163 of the Rules of Procedure)

(ET) Ladies and gentlemen, European Union Member States from Estonia to Poland lost millions and millions of their most talented and enterprising citizens to Nazi aggression and the decades-long Soviet terror.
The European Parliament report 'Citizens for Europe' established the action entitled 'Active European Remembrance'.
It was aimed equally at preventing Nazism and Stalinism and at commemorating the victims of the Nazi and Stalinist regimes.
Now, 70 years on from Stalin and Hitler's secret pact, there is still a lack of awareness in Europe of the outrages of Stalin's apparatus of coercion.
The Member States should establish a standing inter-governmental working group with the task of carrying out an impartial examination of the crimes of the Bolsheviks and the KGB and assessing them using European values.
Today, however, the date 23 August should be designated European Day of Remembrance for the victims of Stalinism and Nazism.
On 23 August 1939 the Nazis and the Bolsheviks carved Europe into two spheres of influence.
In so doing they inflicted a terrible wound on Europe which has not totally healed to this day.
<D>
(FR) Madam Speaker, I should like to commend Mrs Trautmann, Mrs del Castillo, Mrs Toia and Mr Harbour for a job well done.
How do we reap the full benefits of the digital dividend?
That is the question.
It is certainly the case that digital broadcasting is releasing and will be releasing frequencies.
I deliberately use both the present and future tenses of the verb 'to release' in order to emphasise the fact that this change is not going to come in a flash, with a snap of the fingers; this is something that many players seem to have forgotten when arguing their case.
In addition, the amount of investment is likely to frighten off many investors before they can even think about recouping this EUR 250 billion providential windfall.
The distribution of these constraints must therefore be factored into our policies.
I should like to use this rather short speaking time to emphasise the compelling need to establish a European frequency policy in which Parliament will be involved as a major player: as such, it will need to be aware of the limitations imposed by the physics of electromagnetic waves, be mindful of the need for frequency spectrum management and show due regard for the role to be played by standardisation bodies in making optimal use of this scarce resource, whilst always bearing in mind the general interest of our fellow Europeans.
I should also like to remind the Commissioner that the roll-out of fibre-optic networks, to paraphrase Jean Cocteau, certainly needs grand declarations of love but it also needs tangible acts of love, accompanied by European funding included in the budget in order to carry them out, to build these broadband networks and to prevent the digital divide in Europe.
<D>
It is now a good two or three years ago, in 2005 and 2006, that a delegation from the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs visited various refugee centres.
After Lampedusa, visits were also made to places including the Canary Islands, the Netherlands and Poland.
The reports on those visits resulted in heated debates, and this Parliament urged the Council and Commission to take action.
This morning, we discussed the proposal to tackle illegal employment in the absence of the Council.
The period within which the Member States have to transpose these directives into legislation is two years.
The issue of immigration is urgent, though, and a two-year period is too long.
We have been debating Lampedusa for three years now, and each time, we discuss measures to drive back illegal immigration.
After each measure, though, it turns out that, after a brief reduction, there is an increase in immigrants.
It is shocking that the reception situation at Lampedusa should need to be discussed in this manner again.
Parliament reports regarding the reception situation appear to be completely ineffective.
I would therefore call on the Council Presidency to make this a priority.
I understand that, in 2007, more than 12 000 immigrants arrived at Lampedusa, and this figure rose to more than 30 000 in 2008.
The detention centre was not built to cope with this capacity.
We have known this for three years.
The old NATO base is being rebuilt to house more immigrants, but this is not an adequate solution.
I should like to hear from the Council what you will do to back the Italian initiatives for better reception facilities.
Is this, perhaps, something Frontex could do, and are other Member States prepared to support Italy financially and equipment-wise?
Last night, on the 8 o'clock news, the whole of the Netherlands witnessed what the situation at Lampedusa is like, but the door has now been closed again to journalists and NGOs alike.
I would call on Italy to be open and transparent about the treatment of immigrants on Lampedusa.
<D>
The report on the European Commission's discharge for 2007 shows some progress, even though we still need to properly harmonise actions and control mechanisms in order to achieve a more efficient use of resources, reduce the number and severity of the infringements and offer greater transparency and determination, especially on gender budgeting.
The Commission's responsibility to cooperate with Member States and institutions must not be ignored.
Cooperation and communication are important tools and we often witness the results of omissions in this respect.
Without making light of some of the infringements in the newest Member States, Bulgaria and Romania, I think that it is necessary to guarantee equal treatment for all Member States.
A special cooperation mechanism is being applied to both these countries, which must not be made complicated.
Some of the texts in the report are unacceptable, in particular, suggestions for a mechanism for drafting quarterly reports for Bulgaria and Romania, as well as special reports on the use of Structural Funds.
I urge these texts to be dropped.
This will offer the countries the chance to focus on overcoming the problems which have arisen.
<D>
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, we expressly welcome this report, which is excellent.
The term 'own-initiative report' is not quite accurate.
What we are doing here is persevering with the subject of Parliament's first Committee of Inquiry - and we shall continue to do so.
I do not want to complain, but it is a shame that we have to do this at such a late hour.
I note with interest on the list of speakers the groups that have asked to speak on this subject today.
It seems it is always somewhat easier to complain about the scandals in the EU than to work on specific, positive solutions.
The road there is sometimes long - we are talking about cigarettes - but it is a good one to take.
We are making progress, and the Staes report shows this very clearly.
Of course, we have the incompleteness of European integration to contend with in this field.
Various Ministers for Finance still cannot resist simply raising the tax on tobacco a little when the treasury is starting to look a little empty, wrongly earning praise from some health politician or other in the process.
I say 'wrongly' because consumers of cigarettes simply switch to smuggled cigarettes or, increasingly, to counterfeit cigarettes.
The profit from this kind of fraud goes directly to organised crime.
The fact that there is cause for us all to celebrate progress this evening makes me even more inclined to remind the House of an episode that does less credit to Europe, and particularly the Commission.
There is evidence that, in the period 1992-2001, approximately 10 000 lorry-loads of cigarettes were smuggled into the EU via Montenegro, particularly heading for Italy.
This is probably the biggest fraud against the EU budget of all time.
The public prosecutor's office in Augsburg, Germany, has made 60 requests for legal assistance in this connection.
There have been confessions, convictions and all such things in Switzerland.
Yet the European Union has not submitted any claims for recovery of own resources against the Republic of Montenegro.
Commissioner, I should like us to be able to stand before our taxpayers and say, 'We have looked into this matter, too'.
There are petty customs officials in Germany, Austria and Central Europe who have done great work in this field, but who it seems have been rather let down by the European Commission.
We must deal with this mammoth affair, for which the limitation period is not yet at an end.
That would be my wish in connection with what is by and large a very pleasing occasion for today's debate.
<D>
Madam President, I would firstly like to thank the rapporteurs, Mrs Lambert and Mrs Bozkurt, for their detailed and painstaking work, as well as for their outstanding cooperation with all the shadow rapporteurs and for their efforts to make good use of our proposals and of our contribution.
These are exceptionally difficult reports containing a great deal of complex technical details, but they are also exceptionally useful for European citizens.
Citizens have seized every opportunity, including the recent referendum in Ireland, to protest over the great social deficit seen in the policies of the Council and the Commission.
They seek a European Union that safeguards their rights, and here we are now, debating Regulation 883/2004, which, thanks to the Council and the Commission, not Parliament, has been on stand-by for years, waiting for the implementing regulations for the annexes to be adopted.
This results in red tape, lack of information, confusion, violation of the fundamental social security and social rights of employees, who are caught in the middle; an à la carte Europe, the way the neo-liberals and the large corporations want it, with a single currency but no coordination or harmonisation of the social and social security rights of employees.
In the midst of this legislative gap, the Commission submits its proposal for a 'Bolkestein directive through the back door' for health services.
These reports reveal another way.
We do not need a Bolkestein directive on health services; we need an improved Regulation 883/2004, through which, according to the reports, all the issues that come to light can be dealt with, by safeguarding the rights of employees and their families while also supporting the necessary mobility.
Therefore, Commissioner, please stop the Bolkestein experiments on health services and promptly proceed, together with the Council, with the procedures for the processing of the remaining chapters and annexes of Regulation 883/2004 so that it can enter into force as soon as possible.
I urge you not to vote in favour of any amendments that weaken the content of the reports by Mrs Lambert and Mrs Bozkurt.
<D>
in writing. - (HU) I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and the Committees for their successful and eminently social work.
At the same time, I was sorry to note that there was not a single reference in it to the question of developing information and communication skills.
We should just think of how much legislation we have created over the years that recognises new rights for European citizens and in how many cases we have prescribed that workers, consumers, pensioners or even tourists should have the relevant information and channels on the Internet.
All these things make sense if the beneficiaries can access the information.
The development of 'eskills' in lifelong learning and in general basic education will assume vital importance, as the foundation stone of a knowledge-based information society.
Another key task for Member States will be promoting equal opportunities in IT and electronic inclusion.
I am delighted that every Hungarian party agrees on this, even if they do not agree on many other things.
Modern information and communication technologies in themselves present an unprecedented opportunity to really promote cohesion and equal opportunities, but we can only use this opportunity if we guarantee the conditions to include everyone throughout their lives, so that, even for 'eskills', the title of the Committee's opinion will inevitably be true: 'It is never too late'.
Thank you for your attention.
<D>
I did not vote for the general revision of Parliament's Rules of Procedure because, in seeking to avoid having an oldest Member by the name of Le Pen in the chair, an inelegant, indeed counter-productive solution has been found, despite there being a solution that would have been acceptable to all those here who are in favour of the policy of gender mainstreaming.
We could therefore have replaced Article 11 with the following text: 'Alternately, the oldest male Member or the oldest female Member from amongst the Members present will, as oldest Member, take on the role of President until the proclamation of Parliament's choice.
The alternating order will begin with the oldest female Member.'
In this way, we could have avoided having a Le Pen as the presiding oldest Member without this House murdering the Rules of Procedure and adopting a procedure that exists in no other parliament of a democratic country.
That is a shame.
Personally, I have more confidence in the French electorate.
I hope it will prevent the election of Mr Le Pen and that this exercise will thus prove pointless.
<D>
(RO) Mr President, just as in the case of Belarus, I wanted to give my reason for the way I voted on the EU's Black Sea strategy.
I want to start by saying that the timing of the idea from my colleague, Traian Ungureanu, to draft an own-initiative report is extremely apt when the European Union is strengthening its regional policy by devising strategies for coastal regions such as the Baltic Sea, the High North and, in this instance, the Black Sea.
I also wish to say how pleased I am that the amendments which I tabled have been included in the resolution text.
These amendments highlighted the need to create a network of NGOs in this region, encourage programmes promoting intercultural and inter-religious dialogue, as well as initiatives such as the Black Sea Universities Network.
In my view, all these measures are good examples of the way in which interaction between civil societies can generate positive synergy in the region.
Finally, I wanted to stress not only the need to strike a balance between economic development and environmental protection, but also the need to implement fully the Convention on the Protection of the Black Sea against Pollution.
I hope that this initiative adopted today in Parliament will receive the attention it is due from the Council as well, which ought to deal with this matter as a priority issue for the European agenda.
Written explanations of vote
<D>
Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, Mr Lobo Antunes, I definitely think that you should take all the credit that you deserve for hopefully being able to conclude this particular file before the end of the year.
Then I think we should have a glass of wine, or port, to celebrate what the Portuguese Presidency has achieved on this very important file.
If Mr Helmer had remained in plenary, I would have turned to him and said that he is a living proof of how European democracy works because European taxpayers pay his salary to be here to oppose, to be against the European Union and all the rest of us.
We welcome him here, we accept him here because his voice is also necessary in this debate.
So those who oppose also play a very important role in this Chamber in the European political debate.
This is exactly the idea behind giving all the political parties the possibility of forming and contributing to the European political foundation, to have a lively debate where both sides and all the different views can be expressed.
And we do it in an open and transparent way about the criteria, about the rules, about exactly what legal base to apply for all of this.
There are no secrets in this particular proposal.
As the situation is right now, all the 10 currently existing political parties at European level have set up political foundations which represent a very wide range of political views and programmes.
This can only stimulate this lively and diverse debate on European policy issues, and it will contribute to bringing Europe closer to its citizens.
<D>
The European Council recently debated the legislative energy and climate change package.
The main concern was the financial and economic crisis.
We cannot, however, overlook the food crisis related to this.
Nowadays in Europe, economically viable agriculture is a requirement for ensuring food security for its population.
I understand the concerns of my fellow Member, Mr Turmes, with regard to biofuels and his opposition to the aim of using these fuels as 10% of the total fuel consumption, which is supported by the Commission.
There are those who consider that energy crops are responsible for the food crisis and the rise in food prices.
However, these crops account for no more than 2% of Europe's current agricultural production.
There is the risk that an unjustified increase in the production of biofuels will compete with food production.
This risk can be counteracted by clearly defined legislation and by laying down precise objectives in the national action plans.
We must not ignore the benefits of using biofuels, such as the reduction in dependence on fossil fuels and in greenhouse gas emissions.
In countries with significant agricultural potential, like Romania, Bulgaria or Poland, using biofuels presents a viable socioeconomic alternative for developing rural areas and promoting environmental protection by utilising the potential offered through energy efficiency and renewable energy sources.
<D>
Mr President, I should like to talk to the Commissioner about one of the reports on food additives, and in particularly about the food colourings known as azo dyes.
I am extremely pleased that we have some very good news: from now on they will have to be labelled on all food products.
I want to congratulate Åsa Westlund, who has worked very hard to get this.
When she started out on this work, nobody was suggesting there could be such progress, and yet we have got progress.
It is a real improvement on the status quo.
But I do not think it goes far enough.
You will be aware I am sure of the study by Southampton University last Autumn which shows a link between the behaviour of children who are fed a cocktail of different sweets and soft drinks and azo dyes.
It is a very serious study; it was published in The Lancet.
It is peer-reviewed and it is so serious that the United Kingdom, through its Standards Agency, has now called for a ban on these colourings in food products.
Many companies in Europe are voting with their feet and are actually phasing them out voluntarily.
The single market is failing on this issue already.
It is quite well known that these products have no dietary value, and there are natural flavourings available.
I saw something in one of our newspapers asking: 'Do we need an end to Smarties?' (these are very brightly coloured sweets), but there are perfectly good natural alternatives to those colourings available.
We do not need to have these colourings.
We welcome what has happened today but hope you will keep working with the European Food Safety Authority to speed up its work on reviewing these substances.
I do not think people in Europe want these artificial colourings, and I think we should be looking more at what people need to have in their food, not what companies want to add.
I hope you will push the EFSA to work more quickly and to get a resolution to this problem.
<D>
in writing. - (BG) First of all, allow me to congratulate Mr Beaupuy on his excellent report.
As shadow rapporteur for the PPE-DE Group, I voted in favour of this report, in support of good governance and partnership in regional policy.
I would like to use this occasion to remind you that in July, after the Commission's critical report on Bulgaria, funding under the three pre-accession programmes, PHARE, ISPA and SAPARD, was suspended.
At the same time, procedures were put in place to enable the operational programmes for the use of funding from the structural and cohesion funds to start.
This placed my country in a very difficult situation.
I would like to use the adoption of this report to express my hope that the frozen funds for Bulgaria will be unfrozen and Bulgarian citizens will be able to make full use of the benefits of their country's European membership.
In line with the appeal the report makes to Member States, I would like to call for a strengthening of the decentralisation process for implementing regional policy in Bulgaria, in order to ensure that the system of multilevel governance functions in the most effective way on the basis of the principles of partnership and subsidiarity.
Thank you for your attention.
<D>
On 19 May 2008 the European Ombudsman, Mr Diamandouros, submitted his report to the Committee on Petitions.
In it, he presented a detailed account of his activities together with data expressed in terms of figures and percentages.
According to the report, the number of admissible complaints addressed to the Ombudsman has risen.
It increased from 449 in 2006 to 518 in 2007.
Compared to 2006, the number of inadmissible complaints fell last year.
The reasons for lodging complaints were various.
They included lack of transparency, unsatisfactory procedures, avoidable delays, discrimination, failure to ensure fulfilment of obligations and legal errors.
Most of the complaints, as much as 65% of the total, concerned the European Commission.
Only 9% of the complaints lodged with the Ombudsman concerned the European Parliament.
The European Ombudsman also mentioned errors on the part of the European institutions.
Mr Diamandouros criticised the European Commission for failing to comply with the legal requirement to publish in 2006 the 2005 annual report on access to documents of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
<D>
Madam President, that is a good question.
Mr Schulz, you are quite right that Belgium was a British invention, and a British mistake.
We have made many over the years.
We have got some things right and some things wrong, just as your country, Germany, has.
Germany's history has not been whiter than white, I think you might agree.
You are quite right.
Actually, holding together the United Kingdom has been something that has been deeply troubling.
Indeed, Ireland went its own way, back in 1921, I think, when independence for Ireland was established.
You are right.
It is very difficult to hold together different cultures.
I do think that the Union of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland works, at the moment, because it has consent.
If it did not have consent, then there would be popular calls for referenda and those nations would be able to break away.
But my point is that in this European Union, nobody is being given that opportunity.
<D>
Madam President, infrastructural development is crucial to our economic recovery.
Whereas in the past it was the construction of road and rail that helped stimulate economies in recession and lead the way to future prosperity, nowadays we must focus on our information and communications technology infrastructure as a driver of future growth.
In this context, I wish to draw attention to the appalling situation in Ireland of the so-called 'digital divide'.
Due to years of government neglect in boom times, we are now left with broad areas of rural Ireland with sub-standard, slow connections and, worst of all, in 28% of cases, without any access to broadband.
How are we to bring prosperity and opportunity to our rural communities without bringing them the means of achieving these goals?
How can we tell our young farmers that they cannot benefit from ICT to develop their agri-business industries because we have not provided them with the connectivity?
I welcome recent statements by the Commission which detail the disbursement of EU funds to address this huge challenge.
To conclude, we must not lose sight of eliminating the digital divide, even in the midst of economic crisis.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, first of all allow me to thank the rapporteur for his work on this report.
Since the adoption of the Council Regulation on fisheries outside community waters in 1994, many conditions have changed and international obligations have increased for the authorisation of Community vessels outside Community waters.
This proposal has, therefore, been put forward as part of the 2006-2008 Action Plan for simplifying and improving the common fisheries policy.
The aims of the proposal reflect that spirit by integrating existing legislation into one regulation, while ensuring that the rules applying to Community vessels in third-country waters are applied equally to third-country vessels in Community waters.
Many provisions are unchanged regarding the current system of issuing fishing authorisations.
The major new points of the proposal can be summarised as follows.
Firstly, all fisheries agreements under which Community vessels fish are included in the scope of the proposal, those being fisheries partnership agreements, bilateral fisheries agreements, agreements in the context of regional fisheries management organisations and private agreements.
This wide scope is essential, as all flag states under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea are responsible for the vessels flying their flags.
Consequently, vessels fishing under all kinds of agreements should be included.
Secondly, a mechanism to reallocate under-utilised fishing opportunities has been introduced in order to optimise the utilisation of fishing opportunities under the fisheries agreements.
This point was raised during the discussions on most fisheries partnership agreements and is now integrated into each of them in order to increase the value for money under each agreement.
As a last point, I would like to mention the proposed provisional application of fisheries agreements, which will grant the Commission the necessary legal basis to transmit licence applications to third countries prior to the adoption of the Council Regulation concluding the agreement.
This will, in most cases, ensure that Community vessels can continue their fishing activities in third-country waters without interruption.
Turning to the report, I would like to comment on the amendments proposed.
The Commission can agree to Amendments 1, 3, 5, 11 and 16.
As for Amendments 7 to 9 concerning the eligibility criteria, this list has been transformed into a positive list, rather than a negative one, in the first Presidency compromise text.
In general terms, the compromise text, however, covers the Committee's concerns, except for the extension of the eligibility criteria regarding infringements in the past 12 months, which is Amendment 8.
The Commission finds that this provision should remain unchanged, believing it important as a precautionary measure in case of possible serious infringements.
The Commission cannot accept Amendment 2 on the definition of infringements, as the definition of serious infringements is clear and is set out in Regulation No 1447/99.
Regarding the amendment concerning non-transmission of all applications, which is Amendment 12, it should be noted that Article 10 has been deleted as part of the Presidency compromise text.
This was done on the basis of the opinion of the Council's legal service, which stated that the Commission has no legal basis to penalise the vessels of Member States as proposed in this article.
The Commission also finds that the Member States' possibility of giving their opinion on any decision is already provided for in Article 9(2) and that any informal procedure prior to or after a negotiation should not be contained in this regulation.
Therefore, Amendments 6 and 10 cannot be accepted.
Before closing, I would like to stress the following.
Firstly, the daily transmission of catch data is required under the Regulation on electronic logbooks.
Secondly, closing a fishery implicitly means that fishing authorisations are no longer valid for the stocks or areas concerned.
Thirdly, all fishing activities in mixed fisheries must be considered as affecting the stocks concerned.
Fourthly, national legislation determines what can be used as evidence in a court of law.
This is why the Commission cannot accept Amendments 13, 14, 15 and 17.
Amendment 4 and Amendments 18 and 19 cannot be accepted, since the text proposed by the Commission is correct - in the case of Amendment 4 - or is sufficiently clear - in the case of Amendments 18 and 19.
Equally, I cannot accept Amendments 20 to 24, since the scope of the proposal is to cover all agreements and not just third-country agreements, as I said at the outset.
In addition, the reallocation of unused fishing opportunities is necessary in order to ensure the best possible utilisation of the fishing possibilities under the agreement.
Such reallocation is best dealt with in the context of the issuing and renewal of licences.
Finally, I would like to stress that this proposal is part of a package containing the proposal on combating IIU fishing, as well as the revision of the Control Regulation to follow later this year.
As referred to by the Committee on Fisheries, the Commission will, while keeping transparency and simplification in mind, aim to harmonise these proposals and avoid any overlap between them.
<D>
(HU) Madam President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Romeva i Rueda for his report, which takes a position on an important problem.
I am very pleased that, as a fellow member, he is taking the situation of women so seriously.
Violence against women is a violation of human rights that prevents women from exercising their fundamental rights.
It therefore counts as one of the greatest global barriers to equality of the sexes in society.
This phenomenon occurs to differing extents but is present globally, and so action must be taken against it globally, in harmony with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
States themselves, Mexico in this case, are responsible for respecting and creating the freedom and safety of their citizens, so they must guarantee the instruments necessary to prevent, shed light on and punish violence against women, even if the violence occurs within the family.
I think it is very positive that Mexico has taken legal steps towards equality for men and women.
Nevertheless, the fight against violence against women cannot merely be restricted to the use of legal instruments, since this is a complex phenomenon that requires complex treatment, legal, administrative, preventive, advisory, victim-support, dialogue and monitoring tasks and obligations for the state in question.
The European Union - which has committed itself on several occasions to ensuring global equality, and which has defined the road map for equality for the period 2006-2010 published by the European Commission, and to which the Commissioner referred as one of its main priorities, as well as the halting of violence against women - cannot remain silent in the face of such atrocities.
When forming external relations, developments in human rights and the equality of women must be considered as emphasised criteria.
The report is excellent, and I recommend that it be adopted.
<D>
I would like to start by making some comments and passing on some information.
On 26 April, 25 years will have passed since the Chernobyl disaster, which was the most serious nuclear accident in the history of humanity.
We still remember those who sacrificed their health or even their lives while battling the disaster, and also the hundreds of thousands of people who had to leave their homes.
The then authorities of the former Eastern Bloc countries spent too long concealing information about the disaster from the world and, above all, from their own citizens.
This made it much more difficult to take any measures to mitigate the effects of the disaster.
Later, however, Chernobyl became a symbol of effective cooperation between the authorities of the countries affected by the disaster and the international community.
While we remember the Chernobyl disaster today, our thoughts are also with the Japanese nation, which is struggling with the aftermath of the tsunami and the accident at the Fukushima nuclear power plant.
Next comes a second piece of information, which is also a painful reminder.
In several days' time, on 10 April, a year will have passed since the Smolensk air disaster.
Ninety-six people died in the disaster, including the Polish President and his wife and 18 members of the Polish Parliament.
One of the members was ready to take a seat in the European Parliament, as one of 18 extra MEPs.
The majority of those who died held high-ranking positions within the state.
They were known personally to many present in this Chamber.
I myself knew at least half of them.
The reasons for the disaster are not yet entirely clear, and we are still waiting for information in this respect.
At this time, we once again join those still mourning their loved ones.
The third piece of information relates to the fact that the European Parliament is alarmed at the US Supreme Court's rejection of Troy Davis' request that his execution be delayed, and that it be made possible for his case to be reopened.
I would appeal to the relevant American authorities of the state of Georgia to make use of their right to commute the death penalty imposed on Mr Davis 20 years ago to a punishment of life imprisonment.
Death can never be an expression of justice.
The next piece of information relates to the fact that we are also deeply concerned by events in the Republic of Côte d'Ivoire.
The presidential elections brought terror and violence to the country, instead of the peace, future and prosperity awaited by its citizens.
Laurent Gbagbo must recognise the results of the elections and hand over power.
We call on both sides to put an immediate stop to the use of violence against civilians.
The international community must do everything in its power to stop the massacre of the population.
All those guilty of crimes will be brought to justice.
This is our deep conviction, and the European Parliament will do everything possible in this regard.
The final piece of information concerns the fact that, in line with my promise to keep Parliament up-to-date with the progress of investigations into the allegations of corruption against certain Members of the European Parliament, I would like to remind you that on Thursday, after a meeting of the presidents of the political groups, you received a letter from me with the latest information on this matter.
We are also taking firm action with a view to drawing up a code of conduct for interest groups and lobbyists, as well as for Members of the European Parliament.
During today's meeting of the Bureau at 18:30, we will discuss this matter and decide on the next steps to be taken in this regard.
Mr Nicholson has asked to speak.
Please take the floor, Mr Nicholson.
<D>
In the area of security and defence, the actions carried out by the European Union as a global player have taken the form of intervention to prevent conflict, thereby giving it the status of the main promoter of peace in the world.
While, at the end of the Cold War, there were questions raised about NATO's role, the new threats to security and progress noted by Europeans in the area of defence and the implementation of civil-military operations in different parts of the world highlight the need for a new arrangement for EU-NATO cooperation.
In the present context, the lack of any common European foreign policy and discrepancies between Member States in the area of funding and military technological capacity make NATO a vital partner for managing military crises.
Adopting a division of labour whereby ESDP supports civil operations and NATO ensures the rapid deployment of numerous military forces should guarantee that both organisations complement and not compete with each other.
Consequently, the rapporteur's suggestion to create an EU operational headquarters could serve precisely this objective by complementing the current NATO command structures in the area of joint civil and military operations.
In addition, we must also take into account in future EU-NATO relations the situation of states in Eastern Europe.
With this in mind, it is important to promote an open-door policy and support a constructive dialogue with Russia aimed at establishing collective security in this part of Europe.
<D>
(FI) Mr President, first of all I wish to thank the rapporteurs and the Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control for doing an excellent job.
Now before us are 30 reports on discharge pertaining to the year 2006.
The most important of them is the Commission's, which relates to 97% of the EU's budget.
The rest relate to the EU's other institutions and separate agencies.
In my opinion, the way the matter of discharge is dealt with by Parliament should be improved.
The Committee on Budgetary Control cannot be a Court of Auditors and still less a firm of accountants.
It is a physical impossibility for it to conduct a detailed examination of the administration and accounts of 30 units.
Parliament has to put its trust in experts and the opinions of official bodies.
Of these, the European Court of Auditors, internal monitoring bodies, and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) are the most important.
Even the most stringent detailed examination of accounts and administration only results in what is an apparent degree of accuracy, and that does not make the outcome any more reliable.
There is no direct correlation between the way discharge is dealt with and the number of reports produced.
On the contrary, when Parliament grants discharge to a single agency, for example, that might be too strong an assurance that the accounts and administration were meticulously attended to.
If Parliament really wants to strengthen its role in the discharge process it should revise its practices.
Otherwise, the Committee on Budgetary Control will be inundated with work.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, we need to overhaul the democratic process.
As a young author and journalist, I used to pay 62% tax out of conviction, because I was convinced, and had the impression, that we were governed by good people.
However, since becoming a Member of the European Parliament, I have seen what actually happens to tax revenue.
Back then, we used to pay millions of schillings every year.
What bothers me in this debate on the promotion of good governance in tax matters is the fact that we are not looking at our own spending, but simply talking about evil tax fraudsters.
Back then, when the tax rate was 62%, my tax adviser was Christoph Matznetter, who later became Austria's Secretary of State for Finance.
He told me: 'you are from Vorarlberg, go across the border, to Liechtenstein or Switzerland!'
I did not do it, but others did.
However, if, in the light of these experiences, you approach this with the sober and rational mind of someone who was not a civil servant, who was not an expense to the social security system, who was not active in any public domain, as the majority of Members here are, then you have to ask yourself how in all the world can I my save my hard-earned money from this wastefulness?
My suggestion therefore is as follows: let us begin at the point where we can demonstrate that a sensible administration will use money sensibly, that is, with ourselves.
Why do we need another 200 new jobs?
Why do we need to fund school skiing lessons this week?
What is all that for?
If you really want to take the fight against tax havens, the recovery of tax claims and the attraction of people to the project of the European Union seriously, then we have to begin with ourselves and show people that the institutions we stand for are spending the taxpayer's money responsibly.
Otherwise, we will continue to lose tax revenue, without any justification for calling those people to account.
<D>
author. - (FI) Mr President, Commissioner, Burma has no respect for human rights or civil freedoms.
As many here have said, it is not for the first time that we are adopting a position on a the lack of freedom of expression, suppression of information, a ban on freedom of assembly, a violation of very basic principles of the rule of law, and a ban on opposition.
The Burmese nation's worst enemy is its own country's leadership, which, with the support of the army, by force of arms and through violence, forces its people to be controlled by its state monopoly.
The junta's prisons hold more political prisoners than ever.
The junta also works against its own people, by preventing international emergency aid from reaching areas where natural disaster has struck.
The international community is powerless as it witnesses the Burmese people perish because of their leaders, who are repressive but do nothing at the same time.
In our statement we appeal to the ASEM Summit, so that the other countries in the region might exert pressure on the junta to work towards the release of political prisoners.
We are being a little sanctimonious in insisting on this, of course, as we know that Burma is not the only country in the region where human rights are being trampled into the mud.
Our group supports the joint resolution.
<D>
I endorsed the EU strategy for youth with complete conviction and with certainty as to its success.
It is one of the key areas of the work of the Committee on Culture and Education, on which I serve.
It is imperative to improve the situation of young people and their educational and vocational chances.
Three matters are crucial in this regard.
1.
Young people in the EU, and also in Poland, are making good use of EU programmes, such as Comenius, Erasmus and Leonardo da Vinci.
Therefore, it is very important to increase funding for these programmes and to recognise them as the basis for development of a multiannual EU strategy for youth.
In the future, these programmes should receive greater financial support.
Investment in the education of young people is the best possible use of the EU budget.
I also appeal for improvement and full implementation of the Erasmus Mundus programme.
2.
As a socialist, I also stress the need to create equal opportunities for young people in their access to education.
It is essential to give financial assistance to those who cannot afford to complete tertiary education.
It is also important to help young people by making their access to the labour market easier.
3.
In view of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, I would like to draw attention to the obligations of Member States concerning implementation of the strategy, which includes encouraging young people to participate in democratic life, paying special attention to young sportsmen and sportswomen and the legal enforcement of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
<D>
(FR) Mr President, I would first of all like to thank our two rapporteurs for the excellent work that they have done, and then hope that, under the French Presidency, this very important road package will obviously have a future and come to a conclusion.
I would first like to focus on two subjects.
The first is cabotage and the date that the European Parliament deemed right to set, in other words automatic liberalisation in 2014.
From this point of view, there is a natural distortion created between the peripheral countries and the transit countries.
Countries such as France, Germany and probably Austria are by nature the most cabotaged countries, and the fact that we have just chosen a definition of cabotage that involves cabotage following an international journey is a good thing, but it means that the social issue is definitely going to create considerable distortions, while in carriage by road, it is the principle of the country of origin that applies, once one is mobile.
I therefore think that it would have been much wiser to wait, as was initially planned, for a report from the Commission enabling us to take stock of the social distortions before deciding on automatic liberalisation.
My second point relates to the derogation concerning driving time for buses.
As I have already said, without going into the subject in depth, I find this procedure detestable.
Under pressure from pressure groups, an amendment has been tabled which is an amendment to a text that is not the original text.
This issue should be resolved by a new proposal from the Commission, amending what we called here the 'Markov report'.
I would also like to remind you that we are tabling an amendment to the Markov report in the form of a regulation when the Markov report was a directive.
Ladies and gentlemen, I am not - ah, it was a regulation, you are right, it was a regulation - but, in any case, I think that the formats need to be the same and that we should not get into this habit of tabling amendments, under pressure from pressure groups, to texts other than the original text.
<D>
(NL) It is to be welcomed that a directive will be introduced that will penalise employers of illegal immigrants.
It is stated, with good reason, that the possibility of finding a job in the European Union is an attractive factor for illegal immigration.
We should, however, be consistent and also tackle the other factors that attract immigrants.
The most important of these factors is the impunity with which aliens can come to Europe illegally.
There are, in fact, Member States that reward illegal aliens, the mass regularisations in Spain, Italy and Belgium, among others, being a case in point.
There is also the hypocrisy of the so-called individual regularisations on humanitarian grounds.
Last year alone, there were no fewer than 12 000 in as small a country as Belgium.
Illegal immigrants should be deported, not regularised, for indeed, every regularised illegal immigrant attracts a multitude of new immigrants.
Every Member State that regularises them does so on behalf of the other Member States.
It is therefore not enough to tackle the employers.
We must address illegal immigration in its entire context.
<D>
(EL) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is true that commercial transactions at European and global level have increased significantly in recent years.
While this development encourages the economic development of nations, it has a significant impact on climate change.
I am therefore expressing, on my own account, my concern about this particular problem.
We need to decide how trade policy can contribute positively towards solving the problem of climate change.
The target we have set for a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 is quite ambitious.
I hope we will win this bet, because the cost of losing will be enormous.
Here I would like to underline the Commissioner's contribution and congratulate him on all his initiatives and efforts in this direction.
Greater support and a greater effort are needed in the transition to means of transport which are more environmentally-friendly; the promotion of industry which is more climate-friendly; the development of new technologies and the creation of financial disincentives for activities with a negative impact on the climate; effective cooperation between the United Nations, the World Trade Organisation and the European Union; and ongoing consultation and the participation of civil society and non-governmental organisations operating in the environmental sector.
The European Parliament has an important role to play.
I hope the results of the Bali Conference, in December, will send the optimistic messages which we are all hoping for.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, we are, I hope, all clear on what the priorities are here: energy efficiency, energy saving and renewable energy.
Nevertheless, we cannot get round the fact that we will need to worry about our gas supplies for many more years yet.
So, what lessons can we learn from the dispute between Ukraine and Russia, and from the crisis that arose from that dispute?
In my view - and I am sorry to have to say this, Commissioner - it seems to me that we will be no better, or at least not much better, prepared the next time this happens.
Neither can it be said that the crisis is over, and I have seen little sign that a strategy is really being developed, or that any conclusions have been drawn from this dispute between Ukraine and Russia.
Certain Members of this House believe that we should conclude bilateral agreements with Ukraine, but it should be pointed out that Ukraine has to bear at least some of the blame for the situation that arose recently, and I would really rather not make myself dependent on arguments between Mr Yushchenko and Mrs Tymoshenko, or Mr Yanukovych, or whoever.
Ukraine would, quite naturally, clearly much rather buy the gas from Russia and then sell it on to us, naturally for an additional charge, as would Turkey in relation to Nabucco, but I will return to that later.
If, then, we want our gas to be just as insecure, but more expensive, we should make a bilateral agreement but, if we want to find a real solution, we need to make a trilateral agreement encompassing Russia as the supplier, Ukraine as the transit country and ourselves, and come to an agreement in this connection, particularly with regard to transit and infrastructure.
I have heard nothing from the Commission on this or on what alternative suggestions it has.
With regard to investments in infrastructure, if we look to the east, there are basically three pipelines up for discussion: Nord Stream, South Stream and Nabucco.
Nord Stream is a supply pipeline in the north; it solves the transit problem, but will not reduce our dependency on Russia.
South Stream may also solve a transit problem, but again will not reduce our dependency on Russia.
On top of that, if one looks at the costs involved, South Stream is actually somewhat more expensive than Nabucco, at least according to a number of studies, which suggests that we need to invest massively in Nabucco.
When I consider - and I have mentioned this on a few previous occasions as well, Commissioner - how quickly the United States constructed the PTCP oil pipeline and how long we are taking over the Nabucco gas pipeline, I really do think it is scandalous how little Europe has achieved: it is a sign of our weakness.
We need to act quickly, not just with regard to Azerbaijan or Turkmenistan - which we will be discussing shortly - but also in relation to Iraq.
The fact that gas there is simply being released into the air as exhaust, with no consideration being given to how it could be transported to the Nabucco pipeline, really is a big mistake.
I would ask you, Commissioner, to negotiate quickly and clearly with Turkey, in order to ensure that we also get their agreement to this.
We will, of course, also need to convince Cyprus to stop blocking the energy chapter: their insistence that we cannot even negotiate on this chapter shows a lack of solidarity, because it quite naturally causes difficulties with Turkey.
You are nodding, Commissioner; I see that we are in full agreement here.
Turning finally to nuclear energy, there are some very different opinions on this subject in this House.
Unfortunately, I too cannot vote in favour of the Laperrouze report, for example because it is too one-sided in this respect.
The thing that disturbs me about this whole debate is that we now have a new development in France, namely a reduction in atomic waste, but, when you look more closely, you find that this atomic waste is more radioactive.
That is not the way to solve the problem, particularly with regard to waste.
We will need to apply a lot more energy and brainpower to solving the problem of waste and disposal.
<D>
Vice-President of the Commission. - Well, of course this is a constant struggle to make sure that we can provide information - that we can provide interpretation and translation in all 23 official languages.
Sometimes we are not able to respond fully to that because we lack interpreters, for example, or we have not yet a full staff that can respond to this request, but I take note of your comment on that and we will look into it as well.
I will also make a visit soon to Lithuania and I am sure I will hear more about this, but this is not due to a lack of will from the Commission.
It is the starting point for any communication that you can communicate, hopefully, in your own language and understand what is being told, also in your own language.
Therefore, we will continue to endeavour to make sure we provide all the necessary resources for doing so; therefore I fully respect your question and I think it is a very serious one.
Well the other point was of course a comment and it is a fact that we have to start where citizens are.
We have to respond to the questions they have, and of course the truth is that very rarely do they start by asking about the Treaty provisions or an amendment.
They start by asking, What do you do about immigration?
What do you do about climate change?
How do you fight the problems that we see as cross-border problems, and how do you deal with that?
And this is how we have to respond, and in an everyday language.
I think that what has actually helped - and this is something I take credit for - is that we have now started with these citizens' summaries to all the proposals that we present.
Also in our work programme, we will have an accompanying citizens' summary, and I see that this is very useful, and we have to continue along these lines.
Subject: Commission's Plan D for Dialogue, Democracy and Debate and 'Debate Europe'
The Commission's Plan D for Dialogue, Democracy and Debate of October 2005 was a response to the EU's 'period of reflection' following the negative outcome of the referendums on the Constitution.
Two and a half years later, does the Commission believe that it has effectively attained the objectives of its plan?
If not, why not?
What were the obstacles?
As regards the Commission's recent communication on the 'Debate Europe' project (April 2008) to bring citizens closer to the Union and its institutions, can the Commission provide details concerning eligible expenditure, the amount that will be available per Member State and organisation, and the beneficiaries that will undertake the pan-European consultation projects with citizens?
How will it provide a framework for cooperation among the EU's institutions and, in particular, with the European Parliament?
How will it contribute towards setting up electronic networks in which MEPs and members of national and regional parliaments will participate?
How will it create European public spaces in the capitals of the Member States?
How will it become more active at local level?
<D>
in writing. - This directive deals with regulations on marketing authorisations for medicinal products.
We welcome the EU's initiative to simplify and harmonise the current regulations.
This is a time- and money-saving matter which will satisfy both manufacturers and consumers in Ireland.
The proposed revisions will be beneficial for the Irish pharmaceutical market which has a substantial presence in Europe.
We are grateful that in this sector, 13 of the top 15 companies in the world currently operate in Ireland.
There are currently over 140 med-tech companies in Ireland, which accommodate 26 000 jobs.
Moreover, the annual export of medical devices amounts to approx EUR 6.2 billion, which is 10% of Ireland's total exports.
We support the creation of single criteria for evaluation, approval and administration of pharmaceutical products that undergo changes such as manufacturing methods, product labelling or patient information brochures.
We also recognise the need for further harmonisation of Member States' national provisions and European regulations to reduce administrative burden and to simplify the system regulating changes, such as allowing a single application for one or more identical changes.
We agree to the revision of the Commission's control over 'listings of substances', 'withdrawal periods' and 'principles and guidelines'.
<D>
in writing. - (CS) What was the legacy of the Soviet Union in the countries of Central Asia?
Equality for women, abolition of child labour and illiteracy, monoculture farming.
In none of these countries have religious elements succeeded in establishing supremacy.
The EU's first priority is the use of the natural resources of those countries, namely oil, natural gas and uranium.
Another priority is blocking one of the main channels of opium smuggling from Afghanistan.
This brings us to the direct responsibility of the EU and the US for supporting the establishment of authoritarian regimes in the countries in that region.
The individual countries try to limit the proliferation of terrorist groups and the spread of militant Islamic ideas, but such a situation has a negative effect on the development of civil society and participative democracy and tends to support the rule of force.
Notwithstanding all the criticism of the countries of the region in the report, we must always remember the difficult historical conditions faced by these countries in the course of their development.
The EU must help them to overcome the results of many years of negativity created by the presence of the large EU states and the US in neighbouring Afghanistan.
There is no reason to favour Turkey as the main potential mediator for a positive influence in the region.
The present situation as regards respect for the rights of minorities in Turkey certainly does not justify that approach.
In contrast, much more attention should be paid to the traditional ties to Russia.
When it comes to our fight against the spread of terrorism and drugs throughout the countries of that region, Russia is our closest ally.
In spite of the above-mentioned reservations, I support the adoption of the report.
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I hardly dare take the floor here any more; given the overall atmosphere here in plenary, I hardly dare ask questions any more.
Of course we are all against discrimination, but one dare not question the route we are taking here for fear of being pushed into a corner.
Ladies and gentlemen, we do all agree on the destination here, and I would appreciate it if we could all refrain from suggesting otherwise.
What we are arguing about is the route, and that must be a legitimate subject for discussion, even by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
First of all, I have something to ask the Commissioner: given that the old directive, the existing anti-discrimination directive, has still not been transposed in ten of the Member States - given that infringement proceedings are underway against ten Member States - we seriously have to ask ourselves why we need to revise this directive when the old one has not even been transposed yet.
Is that a serious question that we are allowed to ask?
That is why referral back to committee really is an argument that we should be allowed to raise here.
On the second issue, too, we are allowed to talk about the content.
For example, there is the question of why the churches, which were close partners of the Left when it comes to the protection of refugees, are now coming to us.
The churches, which used to be your partners, are now coming to us and saying that they have difficulties with certain wordings.
When media people, newspaper publishers, come and tell us they have questions, we should discuss those questions seriously.
When we discuss families, the Commissioner says that he does not want to impose anything on the Member States, but, of course, what we are doing with this directive is harmonisation by the back door.
The list goes on.
There are various arguments that could be raised that give our group cause for concern, considerable concern.
It is possible to raise these things, even if one is committed to fighting discrimination.
The Left in this House today is very pleased with itself, because it is once again creating new legislation on a number of points.
We should therefore be allowed to wonder whether, in the end, the legislative approach will actually bring many new benefits for the people we are trying to protect.
There are other basic values that are worth taking into account: for example, if we are to include private contracts as the Socialist Group in the European Parliament wishes - not just commercial contracts, but also private ones - we must be allowed to wonder whether contractual freedom is not an important basic value that we in Parliament should be protecting.
The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is opposed to discrimination, and will always work to combat it, but we must be allowed to argue in this Parliament about how to do so.
<D>
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DA) Mr President, 750 million women are living in poverty, and these women are fighting for their own survival as well as that of their families.
As Europeans we must fight alongside them for their right to a better life.
The role of women is inestimable; yet their abilities and potential are not appreciated.
Their access to education, work and property is severely restricted.
It should be one of the principal tasks of the EU to ensure that women are placed at the centre of development work involving the EU.
As things stand, our policies all too often end up lowering the already low status of women, and for this reason I am very pleased with Mrs Uca's report.
It is important not to dilute this report, as many in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Union for Europe of the Nations Group are attempting to do through their amendments, which would remove all talk of women having sexual and reproductive rights.
As has been said many times already, these rights are crucial to enable women to take responsibility for their own and thus their families' lives.
This is often a matter of life or death for them.
Women must have the right and opportunity to say 'no', in order to avoid violence and to obtain an education and the opportunity to set up on their own.
This is crucial if development is to result from our development aid, and it is both immoral and foolish not to put women at the centre of this work.
Unfortunately, the political will is lacking, of course - as has also been said - and thus many of us support a proposal for the appointment of an EU High Representative for women.
He or she should ensure that women are involved in political and social work worldwide, bringing to bear the influence they ought to have as half of the world's population.
Women must not become victims or poor wretches.
We all need them to be put on an equal footing with all of us.
<D>
Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, I would like to thank all MEPs who have taken part in this debate, at what is clearly a critical stage.
We have heard some particularly moving accounts of past events which some of you have experienced at first hand.
I should very much like to clear up any misunderstandings.
In the case of Mr Beazley, in particular, I do think that there has been a misunderstanding.
I made a speech that had been prepared for me, but I have to say that I may well have been misunderstood.
Every Member State has responsibilities, it has to be said.
However, the Union most certainly does intend to face up to its responsibilities.
We want the truth, we want the whole truth, and if the Commission opened the debate - it was my colleague, Franco Frattini, who opened the debate at the hearing - it is precisely because we want to get to the bottom of the truth.
This must be made quite clear.
We want not only each Member State to be held individually responsible for honouring this duty to remember, but also all EU citizens to feel a sense of solidarity and involvement in the tragic events that have taken place in some of our Member States.
In this respect, I would like to say, and, in fact, I did say in my opening statement, that I am aware that, in the west especially, we have not always grasped the full extent of the atrocities and heinous crimes experienced by our friends from those Member States that have been subjected to various forms of occupation and have lived under Stalinist occupation.
Therefore, I have come here today, in person, because I would like to reassure you that the Commission will continue this discussion and will ensure that it provides the basis, in particular, for the study that we are going to carry out in order to look at how the various laws and practices have actually been applied in the Member States with a view to remembering totalitarian crimes.
Obviously, the Council statement does not refer specifically to Stalinist crimes but speaks generally of totalitarian regimes.
However, it is quite clear from the context in which this statement was adopted, particularly in the Member States that were behind it, that the issue of remembering Stalinist crimes lies at the very heart of this process.
I believe that this has to be said, and, when I opened this debate, I emphasised that any form of totalitarism, any totalitarian regime that has resulted in a denial of the human person and his fundamental rights, is totally unacceptable.
In this regard, and some of you have emphasised this point, knowledge about experiences of other types of totalitarian regimes may be helpful in identifying the means by which the very acts of abuse and barbarism that you have condemned actually came about.
I therefore believe that this study must be very broad in scope and clearly should not disregard any form of totalitarism.
Nor should this debate provide an opportunity for base political exploitation.
The Commission is naturally aware of this risk, but were the European Union to remain silent on the tragic past of some of our Member States, this would serve only to increase such a risk and to create a great divide between the new and the old Member States.
This is why we must move forward together.
Therefore, Mr President, I should just like to ask what, essentially, is the purpose of all this?
It is so that we may guard against any form of revisionism, any historical untruth.
Secondly, we must also, by remembering, prevent these totalitarian regimes from returning to haunt us.
Finally, we have a duty of reconciliation that is clearly associated with this approach.
However, I would also urge that we must look to the future, and some have emphasised the need to move towards the introduction of a directly binding European law to prevent these totalitarian regimes from ever returning to haunt us.
I should like to reassure you, ladies and gentlemen, that, quite apart from these few words of response, I am personally entirely convinced that we all, as Europeans, have a collective duty of solidarity to establish the truth, our truth as Europeans, without disregarding or diminishing the crimes that have been committed under various totalitarian regimes.
In this respect, I believe that our friends from Eastern Europe need especially to appreciate that we are committed to seeking the truth and will not rest until it is known.
<D>
Madam President, it is with heavy heart that I stand up to speak once again on Lisbon.
I do not normally speak here just for the sake of being negative.
I believe that the European Union talks the talk when it comes to the Lisbon Strategy.
However, today, almost 10 years since the summit, it is a long way from walking the walk.
We hear many warm words about the need for the skilled workforce that will be able to adapt to economic upheavals, such as the one we face today.
However, across Europe we still face a chronic skills crisis.
In my region, the West Midlands, the skilling of the workforce has had a particularly painful and protracted birth.
Regrettably, we have the highest proportion of skill-shortage vacancies of any British region.
I would, therefore, call on the Commission not to lose sight of the structural reforms needed to reinvigorate the Lisbon Strategy during a period which is beset with economic disorder, higher oil and commodity prices and ongoing turbulence on the financial markets.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I would like to use my speaking time by responding to some of your questions and comments in this, in my view, very responsible exchange of views today.
I shall start with Mr Watson's remarks concerning visas and human rights, but first I have to comment on his remarks concerning my colleague, Benita Ferrero-Waldner, who is responsible for our relations with Moldova.
You said Benita is an instinctive optimist.
I can defend her and the Commission's position first by saying that, in fact, the Commission position is very realistic and balanced.
Secondly, you have to be a professional optimist to be a European Commissioner, at least if you are responsible for EU enlargement and relations for south-eastern Europe.
Concerning the visa question, we are indeed dismayed by Moldova's decision to impose a visa requirement on Romanian citizens.
This is not acceptable.
We are examining the legality of this move.
We will pursue the issue on 30 April, on the eve of Labour Day, 1 May, with the Moldovan authorities within the context of the Commission-Moldova Joint Management Committee, which has been created under the visa facilitation agreement.
Overall, concerning the elections, their aftermath and human rights violations, the Commission strongly condemned the violence that erupted in the streets of Chişinău on 7 April and the massive and excessive use of force by the law enforcement agencies' forces and, reportedly, by private militia in the aftermath.
Reports of widespread human rights violations with respect to detainees, as well as of abductions, are of serious concern.
We see that, realistically, it is of the utmost importance for Moldova to live up to its European aspirations, that allegations of human rights violations be investigated thoroughly and impartially with the participation of all political forces and, as appropriate, under international scrutiny.
Those suspected of having committed criminal acts, including human rights abuses, must be investigated and, if charged with such acts, offered the right to a fair trial.
Finally, on the likely impact of the election aftermath on EU-Moldova relations, it has brought to the fore the unfinished nature of Moldova's internal reforms, particularly with regard to the rule of law and respect for fundamental freedoms.
We expect all concerned parties in Moldova, the official authorities as well as the political opposition and civil society, to agree on and progress towards a solution to the current crisis that will bring about more, not less, democracy and freedom for the Moldovan people.
The history of what has become the European Union is concrete proof that dialogue and cooperation and the rule of law can yield a coherent and sustainable mix of respect for fundamental freedoms, political stability and economic prosperity.
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, there is so much to be done.
Let me start with what the Commissioner really highlighted in his speech, which is the effect on children, because one of the campaigns that is running this year, of course, is Stop Aids in Children.
We know that every minute of every day a child is born with HIV; we know that 2.3 million children are living in our world with HIV; that only one in 10 who needs anti-retroviral treatment receives it; in the absence of treatment we know that an estimated one third of infants die in their first year and half die by their second birthday; we know that 15.2 million children under the age of 18 have lost one or both parents to AIDS; and we know that by 2010, that magical year, more than 20 million children will have been orphaned by AIDS.
That is the children's story, that is the challenge regarding children, but of course it is an adult story as well.
We know the numbers that we have in our various countries for people being diagnosed, for people living with HIV: all on the up, and the frightening statistic that one in three people do not know they are infected.
That is the challenge, but there are specific challenges I think we should highlight this year, and the Commissioner has hinted at some of them.
The level of basic knowledge has actually been going down in the last five years: the public is less aware than it was.
Myths and misunderstandings have been growing.
One in five people do not know that HIV can be transmitted through sex without a condom.
Fewer than half of all sexually active people always use a condom with a new sexual partner.
We know that the number of people diagnosed has trebled since 1997; we know that risk-taking sexual behaviour is on the increase; we know that a quarter of all HIV-related deaths are due to late diagnosis, and a third are preventable.
And, specifically, we know that failed asylum seekers living with HIV are too often not eligible for free HIV treatment and so cannot afford lifesaving care, and can go on and infect others.
We also know that the rate of HIV among male prisoners is 15 times higher than among the general population.
All those things we know, along with the knowledge we have of the hopeful signs, of research.
Recently in Rwanda I saw for myself the research, the ongoing clinical trials and the need for trials in Africa for vaccines for Africans.
But all these things need that urgency, and 2010 is the target year; 2010 is nearly with us.
2010, Commissioner: you and I come to the end of our term of office.
I want us not to hide behind that fact and leave it to our successors.
I want us to say, in 2009, when you and I may be leaving office, at least we have fulfilled this promise.
<D>
Unfortunately, conditions of extreme drought and forest fires in southern Europe have been growing both more frequent and more intense.
Immense damage has been caused in terms of loss of human life (11 people have died just this summer), reduced economic activity and environmental degradation, particularly through an increase in the rate of desertification, in that some 400 000 hectares of European forests have disappeared every year over the last decade.
Climate change is contributing to the increase in natural disasters, but many cases are still unforeseeable or are caused by criminal acts.
Scientific research therefore needs to be developed so as to improve risk assessment procedures, fire prevention systems and fire-fighting facilities, and the requisite financial resources must also be released.
We need a European strategy to combat natural disasters, as well as greater interoperability and coordination among the various Community instruments.
The Member States should enhance their cooperation and coordination so as to guarantee solidarity and the availability of additional rapid mobilisation resources to fight these disasters.
I call on the Presidency of the Council to make an urgent decision on the regulation for the new Solidarity Fund, in order to increase transparency and make its mobilisation more flexible in an emergency.
<D>
(PL) Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on the report.
When discussing the whole issue of the Community's strategy to reduce CO2 emissions, it should be remembered that, in Europe alone, two million people are employed in the automotive industry, and another 10 million jobs are linked to this sector.
This industry represents 3.5% of European GDP.
The export value is EUR 33.5 billion and, what is no less significant, each year motor taxes generate EUR 365 billion for Member States.
The Community's strategy to reduce CO2 emissions will be successful only if it is thought through properly and provides sufficient time for producers to develop appropriate technological solutions.
I am in favour of introducing an appropriate transition period because the production cycle in the automotive industry is complex and needs a long time to adapt.
It would seem therefore that the best date for the introduction of the regulations would be 2015, also because the Euro 6 Regulation will come into force in that year.
I also think that there should be an integrated approach to CO2 emissions.
Research studies have indicated that to achieve the objective of 120g/km just through improvements in automotive technology will result in an increase of around EUR 3 600 in the average price of a car, which may result in many brands of cars becoming less accessible to the average EU citizen.
For this reason, basing CO2 emissions exclusively on engine technology is the most expensive solution.
One could achieve the 120g level by introducing additional solutions, such as introducing biofuels to a greater degree than at present, as well as by introducing additional solutions in vehicles, such as signals to change gears or low resistance tyres.
<D>
The impact of Ireland's approval of the Treaty of Lisbon is making itself felt across the whole European continent.
The purpose of this Treaty is obviously to simplify the decision-making process after the EU's expansion towards the east.
Against this background, the message conveyed by our partners in Ireland is in support of solidarity among Europe's citizens.
We are also talking about one of the last European Councils to be held under the EU's rotating presidency system.
This fact is all the more significant in that the selection has to take place of the occupants of the main posts that will be held in the coming years.
This is an issue which has triggered lively debates, involving countless political sensitivities.
In my opinion, our task is to deal with an issue where clear-cut principles must take priority over any feelings of pride of the moment.
It is our duty to offer the European Union consistency, efficiency, a long-term future and balanced development for all regions so that it can face up to the challenges on the global political stage, whether we are talking about the economic crisis, climate change, our common identity, etc.
Indeed, the European Union will acquire the strength it deserves only when we are on the same wavelength at a global level and when we can be identified as an entity that takes united action.
(The sitting was suspended for a few minutes)
<D>
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, we have just heard the language of the past:
Die Rede der Vergangenheit!
Others know, often better than we, that we already live in a global society.
India, China and Brazil have caught the wave of opportunity and they are riding it high, while too much of Europe fears the wave crashing over it.
When President Sarkozy addressed us yesterday, he spoke of 'different possible futures for the Europe of tomorrow', putting our policies for competition, energy and enlargement up for debate.
Mr Barroso's expression during much of that speech told us more than all of his words this morning.
If Europe sits on its hands because national leaders - citing citizens' concerns - contest the EU's agenda, we will miss the chance to shape globalisation in Europe's collective interests.
It is not citizens we need to convince, it is Member States.
Survey after survey has shown that most of our citizens see the European Union, not national government, as best placed to manage globalisation.
Look how the earthquake of globalisation is shaking Europe's body politic.
Some on the right are retreating, in the face of global challenges, from Conservatism into nationalism, or from Christian democracy into Christian autocracy.
The fissure of globalisation runs right through the EPP.
On the left, Kurt Beck and his friends are holding back much needed reforms.
Franz Müntefering saw that and that is why he has voted with his feet.
And yet the visionaries see the need for reform and they have written it into the new European Socialist manifesto, adopted appropriately in Oporto.
The division in our politics is no longer between left and right over economic policy but between those who respond to global challenges by pulling up the drawbridge and those who - with Liberal Democrats - advocate the open society.
Mr Barroso, you have majority support in this House for your Commission's approach to globalisation.
But it is not a majority based on one political family.
Indeed, it may even prise apart and refashion Europe's political families.
Globalisation will increasingly shape our politics.
Not globalisation in the rather narrow economic sense defined in this communication - although a stable euro and effective competition rules and market regulation are in all of our interests - but in its wider, more holistic sense, encompassing world population growth and migration; climate change and energy security; and internationally organised crime linked to terrorism.
Is that not the validation we need to 'act on a continental scale', as this document urges, to utilise our 'critical mass' to 'enable Europeans to shape globalisation', as the Commission's communication demands?
If so, Mr Barroso, where are your policies?
Your timetable?
Your comprehensive approach?
We were promised action: instead we are proffered a paper which is rich in rhetoric but rather poor in proposals.
This cannot be the final word in Europe's response to globalisation.
I await your single market review, to see how you will drive growth and jobs in difficult terrain, and your legal migration policy, hoping it encompasses the concerns of the countries of origin.
My colleagues and I await urgent action on cutting energy use and fighting cross-border crime.
We believe, too, that social health and economic vitality are both important.
If we are creating a global market, we need a new global social contract, reconciling the competing demands of flexibility and fairness because, as Martin Luther King taught us, 'injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere'.
So the Union must bring together the Lisbon agenda with its focus on competitiveness, the Cardiff agenda with its focus on social rights, and the Gothenburg agenda with its focus on the environment.
The world needs a strong, united Union to counter injustice, conflict and poverty wherever they are found because we are one of the few players capable of tackling global issues and, if we do not take the lead, nobody will.
That means stopping the hypocrisy of trade tariffs and fashioning a fair deal for developing countries in Doha; clinching a contract on carbon emissions in Bali, using our collective influence to get America on board; and building an international approach to financial markets, focusing on regulatory cooperation, convergence of standards and equivalence of rules.
Resolving these challenges in fairness to everybody needs more, not less, globalisation.
For we live in an interconnected world, a world that requires solidarity at global level as much as it requires solidarity between European citizens.
And we must look forward, with Victor Hugo, to the day when the only battlefields are those of markets open for business and the human spirit open for ideas.
<D>
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, today we are facing the last leg of our work on treaty reform.
If the Lisbon summit is to end in success, we need political imagination.
Those who recognise treaty reform as a priority should ask themselves today especially: is it worth taking a firmer stance on Poland and the United Kingdom; is it worth placing a question mark over the outcome of many years of negotiation?
If we are to believe its advocates, the Charter of Fundamental Rights can only reinforce the binding provisions we already have.
But perhaps those who point to the essentially incalculable consequences of its provisions being used by the European Court of Justice are right.
I have similar concerns, and I therefore entirely understand the reservations expressed by the United Kingdom and Poland.
A major element of the compensation for the losses that Poland has decided to incur along with leaving the Nice system is the Ioannina mechanism and the permanent position of the Polish Advocate General at the European Court of Justice.
The undermining of these settlements is currently raising questions for us about sincerity of intent.
Like any other country, Poland has a right to expect better instruments to scrutinise the EU's legislative process.
The absence of proper legitimation will, after all, bring defeat for the European project in the future.
Lack of scrutiny of the legislative process is not something dreamed up by Eurosceptics or warmongers, as the constantly somewhat agitated Martin Schulz would have it.
It is something that worries sincere Europeans.
The former President of the Federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe and former President of Germany Roman Herzog asked recently whether Germany was still a parliamentary democracy, considering how many regulations have come into being outside the Bundestag.
<D>
author. - Mr President, I should like very much to welcome Commissioner Vassiliou here this evening to listen to our oral question, especially at this late hour.
When we deal with cloning, it is not only a case of food safety, but also we in Europe believe that, under the common agricultural policy, we are producing food to a very high standard and also to a very high welfare standard.
The problems with cloning concern not only the welfare of animals but also consumer confidence in food that may come from cloned animals.
You only have to look across the Atlantic Ocean to the United States of America to see how to stop cloned animals from entering the food chain.
For instance, if a cloned bull is worth EUR 1 000 at the end of its life to go into the food chain, then the people who have bred that bull have to put up a bond, which may be worth EUR 3 000, and when they destroy that animal and make sure that it does not go into the food chain, they get the bond back.
It is quite a simple way of keeping cloned animals out of the food chain.
I think we have to take this matter very seriously and I would urge the Commissioner to look at this again.
I will go through some of the problems with cloning, especially from a welfare point of view.
Cloning entails serious health and welfare problems for clones and their surrogate dams; animal health problems come from invasive techniques required to produce a clone; there is the suffering of surrogate dams which carry cloned foetuses, and high levels of ill health and mortality in early life for cloned animals.
The OIE Scientific and Technical Review identified that only 6% of cloned embryos resulted in healthy, long-term surviving clones.
The EFSA report also points out an increased proportion of pregnancy failure and disorders in surrogate dams of cloned embryos.
These disorders and the large size of clones make caesareans more frequent in cattle carrying clones than in conventional pregnancy.
Mortality and morbidity is higher in clones than in sexually-produced animals; the welfare of both surrogate dam and clone can be affected.
On the ethics side, the European Group on Ethics has doubts as to whether cloning animals for food supply is ethically justified.
It also does not see convincing arguments to justify the production of food from clones and their offspring.
If you look into the figures of what has happened when animals are cloned, cloned calves are often 25% heavier than normal, leading to a painful birth; 25% of cows pregnant with clones at day 120 of gestation develop hydroallantois.
Reports in 2003 show only 13% of embryos planted in surrogate dams result in calves delivered at full term; only 5% of all cloned embryos transferred into recipient cows have survived.
EFSA's opinion cites a study where out of 2 170 cattle receiving embryos only 106 live births occurred - 4.9% - and only 82 survived more than two days.
We also have to consider the problems that occur not only on the animal welfare side but also in the gene pool of animals - and this is a farming aspect also.
Take the Holstein Friesian - it is thought that there are only about 50 strains of the Holstein Friesian.
If we start cloning bulls and the heifer from a cloned bull is then put back on to the offspring, so the same father is used, then we will create an even tighter gene pool.
There are then problems with disease and with genetics being carried over to those offspring.
Therefore, we need to make sure there is hybrid vigour.
The industry itself cannot explain why a cloned animal has the cell of the parent - an older cell.
Therefore, again, there is the risk of producing an animal that is not as strong and as healthy.
Therefore, I call on the Commission to submit proposals prohibiting the cloning of animals for the food supply and the placing of cloned animals on the market in meat and dairy products.
<D>
I voted for this report in the conviction that putting the recommendations into practice will boost life expectancy in the European Union and help us achieve the Lisbon objectives related to economic growth.
The report reveals the vital link between poor application of Community environmental legislation and the adverse consequences on citizens' quality of life.
The battle to reduce the effects of climate change on the population's health must also be supported by active policies aimed at adapting to climate change.
One example in this regard is the development of methodologies for forecasting and preventing major health problems which may appear, depending on the severity of the effects of climate changes, while also bearing in mind socio-economic conditions.
Efforts need to be stepped up in order to meet the objective proposed by the Commission in 2005 of achieving a 40% reduction in the number of deaths caused by air pollution by 2020.
The studies carried out have demonstrated that two out of five deaths worldwide are directly or indirectly linked to environmental factors.
I congratulate the rapporteur.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, two reports on today's discussion.
Firstly, there have been violent protests against high food prices in Haiti, Bangladesh, Egypt and other countries.
Secondly, European farmers are demonstrating against the fall in prices in the dairy sector.
To all appearances, there are two conflicting reports, but they do belong together and prove that there are many sides to the crisis.
We need a package of measures because the temptation to resort to protectionism through food producers and retail chains is an aspect that should be taken seriously and policy must be determined here first.
Unlike Mr Borrell, I do no believe that we should be regulating, but that we should be providing greater competition.
That is the key!
I do not therefore see the often quoted connection between food prices and the cultivation of renewable raw materials.
This is disproportionate and not targeted.
The fact is that demand for foodstuffs has increased, particularly in China and India.
We cannot avoid this, but we do nevertheless have to state that there is still no shortage of food to justify this increase in prices.
I do think, however, that we must introduce measures to increase food production.
Our farmers' benefit payments should therefore be increased along these lines.
I believe the revision of our agricultural policy is wrong; it has to be developed further - that is an important principle.
We should also, however, be looking at our legislation to see whether it is at all appropriate for increasing production.
We have a lot of regulations, which restrict the use of fertilisers and pesticides, which cause stresses and strains in the Water Framework Directive.
These are not now causing price increases.
Here we should once again be thinking about whether major developments are necessary.
The issue of set-aside must also, of course, be developed further.
Set-aside must be removed.
We should be cultivating food in these areas.
<D>
I welcome what the proposal says about establishing rules for transporting passengers on buses and coaches to eliminate discrimination on the basis of disability.
I welcome what it says concerning proportionate compensation and the provision of appropriate assistance to passengers in case of cancellation or delay.
It must be ensured, however, that as a result of this proposal, small carriers do not have to discontinue rural services because of red tape or greatly increased insurance costs.
Very many bus services in Ireland are run by local carriers, small businesses and family businesses.
Excessive regulation of local and regional services would be a significant financial and administrative burden on businesses that are already struggling.
Rural bus services are vital to rural life.
They are a 'greener' transport system and often are the only means of transportation for those living in remote rural areas.
It must be ensured that too great a burden is not placed on these businesses, a burden which would put them out of business.
Passengers should not suffer because of this proposal, either because of more restricted services or higher prices.
<D>
in writing. - (PL) Globalisation is an unstoppable process, but the success of the European Union in this globalisation is not a foregone conclusion.
For certain, the Lisbon Strategy, implemented as it has been so far, is no recipe for success.
In fact, it is just a paper strategy and even at the halfway stage, in 2005, it was clear that the main objective, which was the race against the USA in the areas of competitiveness and innovation, had not been achieved.
In the meantime other challenges have presented themselves in the form of the economic offensive from China, India and other Asian countries.
So far, the multitude of sensible objectives have hidden the fact that there is not the political courage to undertake structural reforms at national level, which is the level at which the possibility of an innovative and dynamic Europe is decided.
Due to the lack of this courage, the European Union is looking for replacement solutions.
For example, by placing its hope in a radical change in the Community budget, meaning increasing public expenditure on research and development.
This is not enough if it does not go hand in hand with an ability to take risks together with support for innovative companies from the private financial sector.
A solution in the form of the European Institute of Technology illustrates the tendency towards institutional solutions, while the Globalisation Adjustment Fund shows the extent of exaggerated European concerns.
The proper response to the challenge of globalisation is full market liberalisation and courageous reform of the European social model.
<D>
(GA) Mr President, I attended the debate here yesterday.
It was very interesting and very important.
I also attended the candle lighting ceremony outside Parliament yesterday, and I thank our President, Jerzy Buzek, for the leadership he showed in that parade.
The persecution of Christians in recent times is reminiscent of the days of the Roman Empire when Christians were seen to be fair game for murder and attack.
This has to be brought to an end.
It is important that the European Union play its part here, and I think we are doing so, to ensure freedom of expression and freedom of practice for religious groups not only within the Union but also in applicant countries.
That is a very important point around the world.
(GA) I am delighted that this historic resolution was adopted today, and especially that it was adopted unanimously.
<D>
(ES) Madam President, I refer solely to the report by Mrs Weber on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directives 77/91/EEC, 78/855/EEC, 82/891/EEC and Directive 2005/56/EC as regards reporting and documentation requirements in the case of mergers and divisions.
We are in the process of simplifying administrative procedures.
Our position is in favour of the proposals from the Commission introducing certain changes, but we have included some amendments which have been tabled by nearly all the political groups and which, naturally, I have supported, since they make it possible to simplify matters.
We are speaking, of course, of a very important change, which is the elimination of documentation, the introduction of web pages and references to web pages, the elimination of requirements for experts and other types of requirement that up until now have been obligatory, which could lead to a fairly significant reduction in costs and time, while still providing guarantees both to creditors and, for instance, to workers in the undertaking and other persons with access to it.
I believe that the proposals made to us by the Commission are fairly positive and that the proposals to amend the text that we are tabling adopt the same approach, guaranteeing independence, above all in the case of the use of web pages, and the need for references, in other web pages that are used, to any information in these web pages, so that this use is not complicated and there is sufficient additional information.
In short, Madam President, I believe that Parliament will be able to adopt this proposal for a directive by a considerable majority and that the resulting text will be better than the text originally submitted to us by the Commission.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, thank you Commissioner for speaking so plainly.
I think that our main focus now must be directed towards the fate of the civilian population and the only thing that can, in fact, apply here is what was said in the Council of Ministers on 23 February, namely that the EU calls for an immediate ceasefire.
I am against adding the word 'temporary', otherwise the humanitarian disaster which you referred to will continue.
I also think that, in this situation, where the people are trapped in this zone, we must oppose all acts of violence that prevent people from leaving the combat zone.
In this situation, it does not matter to me if the violence is being perpetrated by the LTTE or by government troops.
Our focus must be on the people themselves.
Perhaps I might make a comment to my honourable friends from the former colonial power who are preparing to leave our group.
I hope that the impression which has imposed itself upon me, that there is also a certain domestic incentive to lash out so unilaterally at the LTTE alone, is false.
I also hope that they do not have a specific segment of the electorate in mind.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, let me thank you first of all for a very substantive and responsible debate and for your draft resolutions on Europe 2020 and economic governance.
I also want to thank you for your support for the work the Commission has been doing, especially in the fields of financial market reform and the reinforcement of economic governance.
I would also like to thank Diego López Garrido and his team and the Spanish Presidency for their excellent cooperation and extraordinary performance during these very difficult times in Europe with the most severe financial crisis and economic recession for ages.
It has been a great pleasure to work with you and I highly appreciate that.
Of course, I want to wish the best of success for Spain today.
I could wish some success for Switzerland as well but only once they have joined the European Union!
Tomorrow's European Council will take place in a rather dualistic economic situation.
On the one hand, economic recovery is in progress and is increasingly gaining momentum, even though it is still gradual and fragile.
On the other hand, the turmoil in the sovereign debt markets has cast a serious shadow over financial stability in Europe, which could, at worst, derail the still nascent recovery of the real economy.
The European Union has taken coordinated and determined action to prevent a financial meltdown, but we are certainly not yet out of troubled waters.
We must stabilise and reform our economies to pursue sustainable growth and create the jobs Europe badly needs.
That is what our citizens expect from their leaders.
The European Council must show the way and take bold decisions to this effect tomorrow.
In that context, it is particularly essential to reinforce economic governance in Europe.
We need to upgrade preventive budgetary surveillance to avoid future crises, we need to address macro-economic imbalances to go to the root of the problems and we need to construct a permanent mechanism for crisis management.
All in all, it is high time to feel at ease with life in the EMU and to create a genuine economic union to accompany the monetary union that already exists.
The European Council made a very important decision when it asked President Herman Van Rompuy, in conjunction with the Commission, to set up the task force to suggest ways and means to enhance economic governance.
Tomorrow, President Van Rompuy will give a progress report on the work of the task force and the first set of orientations.
The Commission's communication of 12 May has provided a solid foundation for the work of the task force.
There is broad support for our initiatives and we shall follow them up shortly with concrete reform proposals.
We must now seize the moment to complete the construction of the economic and monetary union.
I count on your support in this regard.
I count on your support for our proposals and for the Community method, which we have to maintain and further reinforce in this context.
Let us keep up the momentum, get results and have the new system functional already by the beginning of next year.
Concerning the Toronto Summit, the overarching theme should be to strive for unity, redress the problems we are facing, reinforce confidence in the global economy and safeguard economic recovery.
I took part in the preparatory meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors in Busan, Korea, two weeks ago, and I shall also accompany President Barroso to the Toronto Summit.
There will be three priority issues in Toronto.
Quite briefly on this, the first is fiscal consolidation.
There was an important change of tone in Busan in the meeting of the finance ministers and governors.
They agreed that the advanced countries, especially the most vulnerable ones, need to accelerate fiscal consolidation.
From the EU side, we made it clear that, given the debt levels around the industrial world - in the US and Japan they are higher than in Europe, for the moment - the fiscal problem is a global problem and not one limited to the EU only, and this problem needs to be addressed as such.
Europe's strategy of coordinated and differentiated fiscal exit was recognised, and indeed endorsed, by our G20 partners and the G20 Ministers therefore agreed on the need for differentiation very much in line with the European Union approach.
Secondly, the G20 must also aim at rebalancing global demand.
This will put the world economy on a more sustainable and higher growth path as we come out of the crisis and for that, it is essential that we tackle global imbalances, especially between the US and China.
The third major issue is, of course, financial market reform.
There has to be a real step forward at the Toronto Summit, given its importance for global stability and also for the credibility of the G20.
Therefore, the G20 in Toronto should carry through the rules agreed on improving bank capital, taking action on non-cooperative jurisdictions, and reforming the derivatives markets.
In particular, we need a strong message from Toronto on bank levies and the G20 needs to show that it is coordinating and delivering on this.
No consensus was reached in Busan, Korea, on the idea of such a levy on financial institutions to foster financial stability and strengthen the resolution framework but, on the other hand, there was agreement on developing a common set of principles on burden sharing.
It is indeed essential that the public sector should not bear the cost of the financial sector's failures, and the principles should also reflect the possible costs of resolution and incentivise appropriate behaviour.
The finance ministers also agreed that further progress on the financial repair of the banking and financial sector is critical for global recovery.
These discussions will continue in Toronto, and I can say from the point of view of the European Commission that we are in favour of broad transparency over the bank stress tests, which are essential to restoring and reinforcing confidence in the European economy.
In conclusion, for both the European Council and the G20, it is now high time for delivery on a smart strategy over fiscal exit, growth enhancing, balancing and reforms, financial market reforms and reinforcing economic governance.
It is essential that the European Council and the G20 now rise to the occasion and concretely deliver at this critical moment for the European economy as well as for the global economy.
<D>
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) The Fava report was based on circumstantial evidence and instead of firm conclusions it simply created a feeling of suspicion towards Member States.
The Marty report was drafted in an even less responsible manner.
All of its findings are based on anonymous sources and are therefore impossible to verify.
This approach cannot provide any assurance that Mr Marty's work was not the subject of manipulation by services and organisations reluctant to engage in transatlantic cooperation in the interests of overcoming terrorism.
I am very grateful to Mr Antunes for pointing out that international law does not make sufficient provision for the problems associated with terrorism.
None of the reports under discussion has contributed anything in this regard.
The official investigations and explanations submitted by Poland comply with our principles of civilian control of the secret services.
Furthermore, our principles comply with the relevant European standards in this regard.
I therefore do not see the point of repeating this debate.
<D>
Honourable Members, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, ladies and gentlemen, it is a particular honour for the European Parliament to welcome to Strasbourg today His Majesty Abdullah II, King of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.
We bid Your Majesty a warm welcome to the European Parliament.
(Applause)
I also welcome the high-ranking delegation accompanying King Abdullah, particularly the Speakers of both Houses of the Jordanian Parliament.
(Applause)
Today's visit by the King of Jordan is the third since 2002, when His Majesty first addressed the European Parliament.
In November 2004 the King visited the Conference of Presidents in Brussels.
His visit and his speech in the European Parliament today are both a sign of the strong partnership between the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and the European Parliament and an encouraging signal for our common future in the Mediterranean region.
Your Majesty, I had prepared a far longer speech, but since we had to ask you to wait for a while, I shall cut my speech short and simply say that it is wonderful to have you here with us, and it now gives me great pleasure to invite you to address us.
(Applause)
<D>
in writing. - The Maltese Islands are the Southern frontier of the EU.
Situated in the middle of the Mediterranean, they are receiving a disproportionate number of irregular immigrants.
The majority file for asylum status.
Frontex - which was hailed by Government representatives as a solution to curtailing the number of irregular immigrants - has been a complete failure.
We have been requesting the sharing of the burden, with little or no response.
Now that this legislature has entered its final year, we are proposing mechanisms for burden-sharing.
Finally we are acknowledging the need 'to help alleviate the disproportionate load which could fall on certain Member States, in particular the border Member states'.
The fact that we have acknowledged the need 'for the provision of mechanisms other than financial to correct the adverse effects of the implementation of this system for the smaller Member States at the Union's external borders' is most welcome, as it refers to Malta in everything but name.
The EU has not lived up to its spirit of solidarity where this issue is concerned.
It is about time that we cut the rhetoric and get down to the substance.
The EU must realise that its smallest state cannot continue to absorb the vast number of immigrants seeking refuge and asylum.
<D>
Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Tabajdi for his excellent work.
It is regrettable that we are not able to conclude our debates with a resolution.
I am firmly convinced that minority rights must become a part of the acquis communautaire.
Unfortunately, the Commission is very reluctant to suggest any measures in this field.
We should remember that minority rights are an integral part of human rights and therefore our standards must be as high as possible.
Let us not forget that respect for, and protection of, minorities is one of the Copenhagen criteria.
The Commission does not even apply the criteria properly during the accession process.
We are ready to make concessions hoping that the situation will improve afterwards, but since the accessions, there are still no tools to address the issue, as Commissioner Barrot pointed out last month.
We have elaborated a common European Union standard in the field of minority rights, and this is an absolute must.
<D>
(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, there are three main crises that demand action from us.
The first is the financial crisis - as has already been discussed - which is encroaching on the real economy to an ever increasing degree.
Secondly, we must not forget the crisis involving the Treaties which underpin our Union, reflected in the fate of the Treaty of Lisbon.
Thirdly, there is an EU crisis with respect to its acceptance amongst the public, which is, I believe, an important aspect to mention ahead of the elections.
Mr President, you have presented a work programme for the rest of the term of this Parliament and of your Commission, and I would like to say that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will be happy to follow the main principles of this programme.
We will support you.
However, we will put different emphases on some aspects.
Emphasis will be placed in line with expectations.
These expectations are aimed at the last few months of your term of office and maybe even beyond.
The PPE-DE Group would like to see itself reflected in the Commission's actions.
We are aware that other groups are making the same request, and rightly so.
We will rely on your political skills for the response.
You have rightly made employment and growth your highest priority.
The response is increasingly linked to the issue of how we should react to the financial crisis.
We support the measures required in connection with the regulation and transparency of the financial markets.
We need extremely specific proposals for reorganising the regulation of the financial markets as quickly as possible.
The implementation of the action plan from the Global Financial Summit is surely first and foremost the concern of the nation states.
However, in view of the globally interconnected markets, close cooperation in connection with all regulatory measures - if only to prevent various different standards from being applied - is imperative.
This represents a broad and important area of activity for the coordination work of the Commission.
Regulation - and we must not forget this - is not an end in itself, but, in a particular crisis, it is a tool used to achieve certain goals.
We need to keep reminding ourselves of this fact.
You mentioned the climate change and energy package which is scheduled to be adopted by December.
I am sure this goal enjoys broad consensus within Parliament.
The PPE-DE Group - and I want to make this absolutely clear - also wants this problem to be solved before the end of this legislative term.
It is a strategic aim.
However, you are asking a lot of Parliament.
Based on the current situation, we can assume that just after the December summit we will be presented with a package containing hundreds of pages in one language and we will be expected to say yes or no to it.
While we respect the goal that we also share, this is a significant abuse of the rights of Parliament and its Members, and maybe we will be able to come up with something more ingenious than this unrefined option.
<D>
I voted in favour of this European Parliament resolution on the implementation of the Services Directive, which entered into force in 2006.
The aim of this directive is to open up the market for service providers in the European Union, phase out the Member States' protectionist barriers on the exercise of service activities and fulfil the principle of freedom of movement, the basis for the common market.
In other words, European service providers must be able to work without bureaucratic hindrance anywhere in the EU.
The directive covers various services, whose gross domestic product (GDP) accounts for 40% of EU GDP.
We expect the implementation of this directive to potentially bring a profit of up to EUR 140 billion and for EU GDP to grow by 1.5%.
However, for the directive to deliver the expected benefits, it must be properly implemented.
Unfortunately, it has been established that not all EU Member States managed to transpose it fully into national law by the end of 2009.
I agree that setting up the points of single contact is an essential part of effective implementation of this directive.
These PSCs are aimed at providing the required information and creating an opportunity to carry out all procedures by electronic means and not only in the national language.
According to European Commission data, 22 EU Member States have established such PSCs, but only 17 of these have e-government portals and these also vary greatly across the different Member States.
It must be emphasised that without properly functioning points of single contact, consumers will not receive all the information, and this will prevent us from achieving the objectives laid down by the directive.
<D>
The purpose of this resolution is to downplay the EU's support for the illegal unilateral declaration of independence by the Serbian province of Kosovo.
Parliament's aim is, unacceptably, to 'legitimise' the creation of a protectorate created and enforced, through aggression and military occupation, by the US, NATO and the EU, guaranteeing their political, economic and military dominance in this highly important region of Europe.
The existence of a 'pseudo-state' under 'supervised sovereignty', protected by the EU/NATO, specifically by means of their 'EULEX' and 'viceroys', the 'International Civilian Representative' and the 'EU Special Representative', who have judicial, police and customs powers, as well as 'executive functions' and monitoring functions, constitute unacceptable acts of neo-colonialism.
With this resolution, we found out that 'the most important of the European Security and Defence Policy (of the EU) missions to date' is a flagrant violation of the United Nations Charter and a dangerous precedent in terms of international law, with unpredictable consequences for the stability of borders, particularly on the European continent.
Some of those who clamoured for respect of international law, and the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Georgia are, in the end, the same ones who promoted and supported the aggression against Yugoslavia.
This resolution merely represents yet another exercise in hypocrisy and cynicism by the majority in Parliament.
<D>
The social economy subscribes to the fundamental principles of the European Social Model.
Its basic features and values involve placing people and social objectives above capital, combining the interests of its members with the general good, and implementing a democratic control system, enforced by its members.
Overall, it constitutes 10% of Europe's enterprises and 6% of the labour market.
The social economy, which is also referred to as the solidarity economy and the third sector, is a key instrument for attaining the Lisbon objectives.
It possesses a significant potential for creating jobs and can effectively be employed to achieve the objective of economic growth.
The third sector plays a leading role in the European economy, combining profitability and solidarity.
In view of the financial crisis, which we have recently been observing with alarm, and vainly attempting to overcome, it is vitally important for us to ensure financial stability.
Europeans dread losing their jobs and expect decent treatment.
The European Union and the Member States must respond to real needs, create real opportunities and build new hopes, for the good of all Europeans.
Fostering the solidarity economy is one way of improving the situation.
I support the rapporteur's motion.
The European Commission should not only promote the social economy, but should also undertake real action to develop a legal framework, within which entities such as cooperatives, mutual societies, associations and foundations may operate, as well as drawing up a programme offering financial support, advice and training to existing enterprises and to those that are yet to be established.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - We have actually tried to introduce a discussion on what we normally call the non-trade concerns, but it has been very difficult to relaunch this discussion with some of the other operators.
I am quite sure that the issue on the products for which we ask for a certain level of taking care of the livelihood of employees and the health of the employees - of course, I think personally that there is a commitment to the companies that import goods from those countries.
You can talk about towels from India with the type of colouring that they are using in specific locations.
So I think if we are pulling in the same direction - all of us - I hope that we can find a decent solution.
Part two
Subject: Doha Round negotiations on agriculture
What is the Commission's assessment of the progress of the Doha Round agriculture negotiations and the 'offers' by the EU's negotiating partners?
Is it true that it is minded to make a larger offer - in comparison to the October 2005 offer - on behalf of the EU in the agriculture sector, primarily with regard to access to the market?
At all events, has it carried out a study on the impact on the European agriculture sector?
In the event of failure of the WTO negotiations, what are the Commission's priorities at bipartite and (inter)regional level in the area of trade in agricultural products?
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I refer to Rules 19 and 166 of the Rules of Procedure.
Before Parliament votes on the joint motion for a resolution by certain groups on freedom of movement, I would like to condemn most firmly on behalf of my group the personal attack in paragraph 13 thereof on the Vice-President of the Commission, Franco Frattini.
I wish to denounce a politically undignified manoeuvre by the Italian Socialists, taken up by certain of my fellow Members, which is unworthy of the challenges we face.
More serious still, this untruthful distortion of Mr Frattini's comments, which our institution must reject, will mean we cannot make a composed decision.
If our group were to vote against this resolution because of this manoeuvre, this would not in any way diminish our support for all the Romanian and other EU nationals who obey the law and respect their host country.
Europe is founded on the rule of law, something we reaffirm in the resolution my group has signed on the joint initiative of our Italian and Romanian colleagues.
The question of freedom of movement is not just a national matter, but a European one.
It is not a case of settling political scores, but a question of values, ladies and gentlemen.
(Applause)
<D>
Member of the Commission. - What is different now from what was promised and committed to in Lisbon?
I think the first thing is that innovation and research is at the heart of European policy now.
We have a commitment, not just from the Commission and from the Member States and the Parliament, but also from the European Council.
We have very strong monitoring in place, which will be done diligently.
We have 34 'Innovation Union' commitments - for which different colleagues of mine have responsibility - where we monitor on a regular basis what the improvement is, what the changes are, what the development is and what has been delivered or, if it has not been delivered, why not.
Every year we hope to have an 'Innovation Convention' at which we bring the stakeholders together to sit down and look at progress over the previous year.
So we have very strict monitoring, which I think is probably where we failed - or did not achieve what we set out to achieve - in Lisbon.
We also have the annual growth survey and will now have the national reform programmes, where Member States will set down very clearly what their targets are going to be and how they hope they hope to attain those targets.
I think that is a step forward that was needed.
On the modernisation of universities, this is a big issue that, I think, faces all the Member States of the EU.
It is not good enough to have one or two universities in a number of Member States that are up there near the top of the tree.
We need to modernise our university system at all levels in the EU and we need to avoid the kind of duplication that has been referred to, where each university up to now might have felt that they had the capacity to have a centre of excellence for every single faculty.
That is not possible or cost-effective, and it involves a great deal of fragmentation and duplication, which is exactly what we are trying to avoid.
But let us remember that the Commission does not have competence in this area.
So what we can do - and what Commissioner Vassiliou is doing assiduously - is explain to the Member States that we cannot continue the policies of the past.
We have to change; we have to decide which are the areas in which we will have - or a particular university will have - a centre of excellence, and we have to put in place a real programme of university modernisation generally throughout the Union.
Subject: Minimal checks and a high percentage of errors in projects in the 7th FP for research
From the Commissioner's answer to questionserious questions arise as to the effectiveness of the checks on the 7th FP.
Up to 31 August 2010 the competent services carried out only 118 checks on 193 participants, a percentage of 0.42% of participants in the 7th FP, whereas the percentage for the 6th FP was 5.7%.
These findings are worrying since over 4% of the budget for the projects was judged to have been wrongly spent.
If this trend is not halted, it cannot be ruled out that financial corrections of more than EUR 2 billion may be required for the whole of the 7th FP.
I ask the Commission:
What are the latest data on the number and outcome of checks that have been carried out on 7th FP projects?
To what is the large number of errors due?
Does it consider the results satisfactory and are efforts to simplify the rules for management of the 7th FP sufficient?
What immediate actions will it take to deal with the problem?

(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have heard the commitments of the Council and the Commission, but I would remind you that the overall drop in sales in this sector in 2008 was 8%.
There are now thousands of workers who have lost their jobs and are reliant on unemployment benefit.
Mr Sacconi gave us the statistics earlier.
This concerns not only the large car firms, but also all businesses associated with the car industry.
I am thinking of Tuscany, where I come from.
As I have had cause to mention recently, according to the European Association of Automotive Suppliers, one in ten companies will be at risk of bankruptcy in the coming months.
I therefore believe that swift, assured and realistic intervention is needed, and I know that Mr Verheugen will be attentive and sympathetic.
There is no time to lose, Commissioner.
Coordination between European countries is essential; otherwise we run the risk of ending up with a scattering of different measures that fail to bear fruit, either for the EU economy or in terms of support for workers.
We must have incentives, coordinated at European level, such as those Mr Sacconi mentioned, that allow investment in clean cars and support for research and new technologies.
We must act immediately to review the criteria of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund to be used to support European workers, and I believe that more funding is needed, from ...

<D>
- (NL) Sovereign wealth funds have been active on the financial market for more than 50 years.
The funds in sovereign wealth funds have increased enormously in recent years in, for instance, China, Russia and the Arab states.
The purpose of sovereign wealth funds is to invest surplus state reserves to yield profits.
These countries may well, I think, be entitled to seek the best way to invest their reserves in foreign currency, so I take a positive view on the contribution of these funds.
The funds improve the liquidity of the financial markets and create growth and jobs.
They also contribute to investment for the longer term.
They create stability for the companies they invest in.
We should, therefore, continue to allow them the scope to invest.
These funds can, however, bring threats along with them too.
We will have to look at the type of investments they are making and whether they meet the requirements for transparency.
There is still not complete clarity about the political involvement in these sovereign wealth funds.
The disadvantage of this lack of transparency is that it can result in growing uneasiness on our part about these sovereign wealth funds.
The Commission should, therefore, take action and that is a good thing.
Otherwise countries will deal with these sovereign wealth funds at a national level.
I am against too much national policy on this.
Europe is the right level to respond to this and we should have a common response.
It is important to have a coordinated position at European level.
I am pleased, therefore, with the response of the Council and the Commission to collaborate closely at the level of the IMF and the OECD.
I look forward to seeing the guidelines that the IMF, the World Bank and the OECD develop and I hope that they will incorporate transparency, good governance and reciprocity.
When it comes to reciprocity, I take the view that we should confine ourselves to the sovereign wealth funds.
We always want private investors, but we can require reciprocity from sovereign wealth funds.
<D>
in writing. - (FI) There needs to be greater cooperation between the border control authorities, customs, the police and the security authorities to improve the safety of Europeans.
The purpose of the Prüm Convention is to deepen cooperation between EU countries to counter terrorism, cross-border crime and illegal immigration.
The Prüm Convention will strengthen security within Europe.
A smooth flow of the exchange of information between the security authorities, especially border control authorities, will be a key priority.
There must be weighty reasons for information exchange between the EU countries.
Clearly, breaking the law is a good reason for this as is sufficient evidence of intended wrongdoing.
Information exchange needs to respect the protection of law-abiding European individuals so that abuses of human rights do not take place as a result of breaches of privacy.
The purpose of cooperation in matters of security is to keep Europe a safe place to live in and to protect law-abiding citizens.
Cooperation in matters of security must protect Europeans against criminals in order to make our everyday lives as safe as possible and to enable our children to live without fear.
<D>
Mr President, as Mr Vondra has just pointed out, we now indeed have a legal framework which is beginning to assert itself.
It has made its presence felt first by the Return Directive, which is the first horizontal document to harmonise return standards in the Member States.
It brings into Community law the applicable provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights and its implementation will allow the application of Community control mechanisms for checking compliance with the acquis.
I am well aware, however, that some of you find this directive insufficient.
For me, though, it constitutes a Community control resource that can be used for checking compliance with the acquis.
Of course, by monitoring its implementation, and let me remind you that the time limit for transposition is 24 December 2010, the Commission will ensure the strict observance of the fundamental principles as regards respect for the rights of migrants and it will assess, in particular, the impact of the provisions on detention.
I have myself said that I will monitor the transposition closely to ensure that no Member States use it as a pretext to extend the detention periods to which they currently adhere.
Others, who had unlimited detention, will be expected to comply with the time limits set out in the directive.
The second text on which we will base our actions is that adopted by the Commissioners on 3 December 2008 on accommodation conditions for asylum seekers.
I hope, Mr Deprez, that the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs might examine this text in the near future so that we can make progress with this new policy on asylum.
I would point out that this text includes clear rules on detention, in full compliance with the fundamental rights, and limits detention to exceptional cases.
We are, of course, talking here about asylum seekers.
Secondly, it takes greater account of the needs of vulnerable asylum seekers and will make it easier for them to gain access to the jobs market.
We therefore now have a legal framework and it must, of course, be put to use.
I now turn to the questions that Parliament wanted to raise in this debate.
The Commission is aware of the difficult situation facing the Italian authorities with the mass arrivals of illegal immigrants and asylum seekers on that country's southern shores, in particular, on Lampedusa.
Up to now, Italy has been able to give access to its territory, saving the lives of many migrants, whilst introducing a procedure which can be used to examine requests for asylum in appropriate conditions.
The Commission also notes that Italy has recognised a need for international protection in half of all individual cases, thus showing that in these flows, there are asylum seekers alongside the illegal immigrants.
For several years, the Commission has been finding the financial resources to support some Member States, including Italy.
This is the case with the Presidium project and the European Refugee Fund emergency measures.
In addition, a few weeks ago, the Commission approved emergency aid of EUR 7 million.
If Italy thinks it necessary, the Commission is ready to examine a new request for emergency aid from the 2009 budget to improve the reception structures on Lampedusa, in Sicily and on the mainland, thus increasing the Italian authorities' ability to examine the individual situations of migrants in appropriate conditions.
I will soon be going to Lampedusa, as well as to Malta, to examine the situation on the ground.
I am also well aware that one of the keys to the solution is the establishment of a solid framework for cooperation with Libya, the main country of transit on the migration routes from East Africa.
I am relying on the efforts of Mrs Ferrero-Waldner to achieve a quick result in the current negotiations.
That is indeed one of the keys and unless this negotiation is completed, it will be very difficult to confront all of the problems we face.
I now turn to Mayotte.
Whilst the Return Directive includes specific rules on detention conditions, with the emphasis especially on minors and families, these Community rules do not presently apply on the territory of Mayotte.
The European Union recognises the territory of Mayotte as French, but it has the status of an overseas country or territory, not an outermost region.
Therefore, private law does not apply, although it is true that France has to take into account the remarks and requests of the Council of Europe and I believe that the French authorities are currently looking at other reception conditions in Mayotte.
That said, it is true that European law is not properly applicable, as Union law is not directly applicable in a territory that is not an outermost region.
Those are the remarks I wished to make to you.
Once again, let me say to Parliament that the conditions for receiving illegal immigrants, particularly asylum seekers, are receiving my full attention and they really are a priority for me.
That is why I will be making these visits to see how things are working on the ground.
I would like, in any case, to thank Parliament for having opened this debate.
<D>
(ES) Hello, Mr Rodríguez Zapatero.
A couple of years ago, you assured us that Spain had exceeded Italy's per capita production and that it would soon surpass that of France.
However, at present, according to international rating agencies, Spain heads the European Union poverty index, with 20% unemployment and a deficit of EUR 78 billion.
What has happened, Mr Zapatero?
Will your economic prescriptions for Europe be the same as those you have applied in Spain?
Furthermore, this deficit has not been used to build extensive communication infrastructures.
When will we, the citizens of Europe, benefit from a rail freight axis uniting the north and south of the continent which passes along the Mediterranean coast?
It is a deficit that has not been used to propel change in the productive model, either.
How can we Europeans have confidence in your will to implement the European Digital Agenda when you have just halved the budget for research.
Finally, in contrast to your fellow European members represented here, Spain still refuses to recognise Kosovo.
For how long will you continue to take advantage of the international community's patience, refusing to accept referenda on self-determination as the democratic expression of the will of the people?
<D>
The European Union, including the new Member States like Lithuania, is responsible for observing the interests of our eastern neighbours.
The strengthening of cooperation between the EU and Moldova and the inclusion of Moldova in Community programmes will help bring this country closer to EU standards and norms.
The Partnership and Cooperation Agreement would enable the promotion of new close links between the EU and Moldova in the fields of culture, education and technology.
It is particularly important for the EU to demonstrate to Moldova's young people the benefits of future EU membership.
Last year, Moldovan emigrants working in other European countries, sometimes illegally, were responsible for 19% of Moldova's GDP.
Poverty, corruption and human trafficking are problems that we must solve together.
As it prepares for EU accession, Moldova faces numerous serious structural reforms.
The EU must continue to support the efforts Moldova has made.
It is particularly important to strengthen democracy and the rule of law.
The Transnistria conflict is a problem for Europe, but it is also an opportunity for the EU to cooperate more closely with Moldova, Russia and Ukraine.
We must not ignore that.
I hope that the parliamentary elections on 28 November will enable Moldova to move forward.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, two locomotives were involved in this dreadful accident which were operated by the SNCB, the Belgian National Railways, on a state rail network.
There is no competition on the rail passenger transport market in Belgium.
Therefore, this has nothing to do with competition or with the opening up of the network.
It is all about unsatisfactory safety standards.
Mr Grosch has already pointed out that the technology for stopping a train automatically when it passes a red signal has been in existence for more than 20 years.
The question is: why was it not installed?
This also has nothing to do with the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS).
I was the rapporteur for the ERTMS.
It represents a vision of the future, but it does not absolve the Member States from the responsibility of putting in place safety measures which are already available on a national level.
That is a task for the individual countries.
Therefore, the question we must ask is why Belgium did not invest in this safety system over the last 20 years.
If they had built a motorway that was shorter by one or two kilometres, they would have had twice or three times the money needed to install these safety systems and avoid accidents like this one.
This was not the first time that a train has passed a red signal.
It was simply the first time that this has led to such a dreadful accident.
<D>
Madam President, I am pleased that Solvency II has at last reached the point of decision.
Mr Skinner and his shadows have displayed exemplary resilience and patience in achieving this.
I am sorry, also like others, that group support is excluded, but not surprised, frankly, in the current febrile circumstances.
We need to work hard to achieve a group system that will work for and in a truly European single market for insurance, which is also effective with third countries - we cannot have any more AIG fiascos.
I would also like to compliment rapporteur Gauzès and the Council on reaching a reasonable conclusion to the regulation of credit rating agencies.
Clearly, these agencies have made serious mistakes, and some form of increased regulation was inevitable.
But who has not made mistakes, not least the regulators themselves, and can we be sure they are now above making any future errors?
I was concerned that the rabidly hostile scapegoating of credit-rating agencies would result in excessively intrusive and counter-productive regulation, with an overwhelming Eurocentric, protectionist and extraterritorial dimension.
The compromise, I am glad to see, has muted these tendencies to some extent, but not to the extent I would have liked to have seen.
Credit ratings are an opinion - they are useful opinions, they are expert opinions, but they are only opinions, so it is up to investors to take full responsibility for their investment decisions.
No doubt these lessons have now been learned and all too starkly and at a cost.
I am glad the scope is restricted to ratings used for regulatory purposes.
I am glad to see that we have moved away from equivalence and endorsement, when dealing with third-country ratings, to equivalence or endorsement.
But could the Commissioner please confirm that this means that investors can still invest freely in stocks and bonds in third countries which are not rated in Europe or which do not have equivalent status?
We must be on the look-out for unintended consequences.
With no prior impact assessment, these will almost certainly appear and, therefore, the review requirement in Article 34 is of vital importance.
<D>
Mr President, one of the greatest problems in relation to EU policy is implementation.
This is particularly true in relation to directives relating to Lisbon and climate change.
On 4 January 2006 the energy performance of the Buildings Directive should have been implemented in all Member States.
This would have led to massive energy savings.
The problem is that only eight countries communicated full transposition on time.
That means that all of the following countries have failed to implement the laws that they themselves signed up to: France, Italy, Belgium, Luxembourg, the UK, Spain, Austria, Finland, Sweden, Estonia, Latvia, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Greece, Cyprus and Malta.
The EU will lose credibility and its attempts to reduce carbon emissions will not be taken seriously unless its laws are respected on time.
I urge you to write to the Member States I have just mentioned, to speed up implementation of this important directive.
<D>
(EL) Madam President, the policy of enlargement is the most successful expression of the European Union's foreign policy.
In the case of Turkey, the message must be clear: the objective is integration, but it comes through fulfilling its obligations, consolidating democracy, respecting human rights and maintaining good neighbourly relations.
Turkey is at a crucial stage, both internally and in redefining its geostrategic role.
Within this framework, it is vital that it continues its reforms and moves steadily towards Europe.
However, I would point out that the climate of tension which Turkey recently cultivated in the Aegean has caused new problems.
In the case of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the Commission clearly emphasised that the country does not meet the basic requirements for the opening of negotiations, given that it has significant democratic deficits.
As far as the dispute over the name is concerned, despite the fact that Greece has demonstrated a spirit of cooperation and realism, the government in Skopje has failed to respond.
Unfortunately, however, in the report by the European Parliament which we are examining today, my country is presented as the only country responsible for the delay in opening negotiations.
That is unfair on Greece and does not facilitate the resolution of a problem which has plagued both countries for over 15 years.
<D>
in writing.
(HU) As the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety regarding the EU budget for 2010, I wish to express my satisfaction with the material before us.
I particularly welcome the Commission's intention to contribute to economic and social recovery, reinforce energy efficiency and combat climate change.
I fully agree that the European Union must take more far-reaching financial and budgetary decisions which make it possible for the EU to play a role primarily in the areas of economic growth and job creation.
Environmental protection - that is, the green New Deal - can, by finding solutions to the current economic crisis, provide an excellent opportunity to increase green technology infrastructure.
The problems of gas supply at the beginning of the year have shown once again the lack of alternative energy sources, alternative energy supply routes, energy source storage capacity and energy transport interconnections among the Member States.
For this reason, it is important that the EU budget duly reflect the need to enhance the security of the energy supply and transport, and for us to invest significant sums in these areas.
As the report has clearly indicated, climate change and environmental protection, as well as the issue of energy security, are closely related to each other.
At the same time, it is unfortunate that the measures to mitigate climate change are still not satisfactorily included in the EU budget.
I therefore see the task of the Parliament primarily as putting pressure in this regard on the Commission and seeing to it that the aforesaid resources are increased.
<D>
I voted in favour of adoption of the joint motion for a resolution of the European Parliament.
Several months ago, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on the Belarusian authorities to end the use of capital punishment on its citizens.
Today, once again, we are talking about Belarus, violations of human rights and the principles of civil society.
The European Union has opened up to Belarus.
We have put the right measures in place, such as inclusion of Belarus in the Eastern Partnership.
The trust we have placed in Belarus was supposed to initiate a switch to the tracks of democratisation and respect for civil rights.
Unfortunately, this has not happened.
In view of this, the European Union must be firm and adopt a stronger position on relations with Belarus, and must take effective action which will guarantee that the rights of minorities will be respected.
I hope the present resolution will initiate changes in the desired direction.
If this does not happen, I expect a review of the European Union's approach to Belarus and the imposition of appropriate sanctions.
Every ineffective solution will be evidence of our weakness.
<D>
Mr President, it would be most interesting if we could compare the vote on the report by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the alternative motions for resolutions by 40 members and the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe group.
We would find:
firstly, that a total of 15 proposals have been amended without sending out any message;
secondly, that over and above the quantitative issue there is also the political issue, with the alternative proposal deleting every reference to the role and responsibility of the large commercial retail and wholesale chains;
thirdly, that the written statement by the European Parliament with its 439 signatures by members who want branches to be controlled and to operate properly lapses by default; and
fourthly, that every unfair trading policy has been deleted or embellished and that it even goes as far as to refuse the recommendation to create a Europe-wide database on farm gate and consumer prices which is accessible to all citizens and consumers.
The objective of the Committee on Agriculture and of the High Level Group is to examine competitive practices and the transparency of the internal market in the food sector.
Today we are all being judged.
<D>
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (ET) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen.
I am pleased that the European Parliament has finally reached this debate on the European Union's strategy for children's rights because a policy which encourages children's rights will form the bedrock of tomorrow's society.
The well-being of society and the state depends on the values and methods used by future parents.
My thanks to the rapporteur for drafting such a comprehensive document.
It is appropriate that the principles set out in the UN Convention on the rights of the child and its additional protocols have been used as the basis for developing an EU strategy on the rights of the child.
However, this strategy to be more effective and applicable throughout all 27 Member States, it must contain more specific provision for implementing measures whose application would be supported both by using Member States' and European Union resources.
The strategy is comprehensive, and I do not have time to go into every aspect.
I would like to highlight just one positive initiative, but one which is effective in all respects, namely the recommendation in the European Union children's rights strategy for a European Union-wide child helpline telephone number; we have had a child helpline number in Estonia for three years now and I can confirm to you that it works well.
I would like to direct your attention to two important target groups, the safeguarding of whose rights I believe we should focus our thoughts on more keenly.
The first of those target groups is disabled children.
It strikes me that in our strategy on the rights of the child, greater attention should be focused on safeguarding disabled children's rights; and that also they, like other target groups, should have genuinely guaranteed opportunities, equal opportunities, to be actively involved in the life of society.
The second area I would like to highlight is that of guaranteeing the rights of children who are not cared for by their parents.
All children unquestionably have the right to a family.
Unfortunately today it is not possible for all children to grow up in the bosom of the family, and they live in children's homes.
We have not paid sufficient attention in our documentation to children who have left children's homes at about 18 or 19 years of age: legally they are adults, although in social terms they are not; this is an area which we should begin to focus some attention.
<D>
Madam President, this has been one of the liveliest debates in this European Parliament since its inception.
Had we done this before we might have had the television cameras here and our constituents might find out what we are doing instead of these boring, turgid things we do day in, day out.
Let me now turn to adult learning.
It is never too late to learn, it says.
This surely is a matter for subsidiarity: it is up to the nation states to decide what their priorities are.
It is surely not for the Brussels Commission, surely not for the European Parliament to decide whether adult learning is imperative or not!
But it also says - does it not? - that it is never too late to learn, and surely one of the things we need to learn very fast is that we cannot divide the people of Europe from their decision-makers.
We must enjoin them on how we want to run the European Union and, therefore, we must have a referendum.
<D>
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, it is often said that the exception proves the rule and this Presidency proved no exception!
Too often we are proffered fine words and vaulting ambitions from Presidency programmes honoured more in the breach than the observance.
But, by resurrecting a Treaty that we all thought dead and buried, you have showed the improbable is indeed possible.
From here on in, Lisbon will be etched on our memories as the moment Europe gave itself the tools and tenacity to make globalisation work for us, not against us.
Politics would not be politics if we let major successes obscure minor failures.
While the Lisbon Treaty is an undisputed success, one should beware of hubris.
The Lisbon Summit, while symbolically important, may have pushed Europe and Africa further apart.
Consensus on EPAs is receding as swiftly as EU assurances to put trade at the service of development.
What happened to the great debate on flexicurity?
Your big idea for revitalising Europe's economy, which fizzled out before we failed even to define it?
Where is the blue card for migration?
Or greater labour mobility within the Union?
Or linking the Lisbon and Gothenburg Agendas through full unbundling and cuts in CO2?
You say you have left your mark on justice and home affairs, but watch out.
Data-sharing arrangements are dangerously ahead of arrangements for data protection and data security.
On the positive side of the ledger: European leadership in Bali, an excellent agreement on next year's EU budget, the constructive abstentions you engineered to give us a common policy on Kosovo are tribute to the skills of your ministers.
And, thanks to your courage and determination, Prime Minister, Europe's bigger Member States can only retard rapid progress for so long.
For, come 2009, when qualified majority voting is in place, when Parliament holds power of codecision and vetoes can no longer hold Europe hostage, the progressive majority, the centrist majority will succeed in making Europe's choices black and white, unblemished by any blotch of brown.
Europe may have lost Beethoven's 'Ode to Joy', but you have understood well what Shakespeare called the 'the tide of pomp that beats upon the high shore of this world'.
And, as befits the leader of a great seafaring nation, you have caught it on the ebb.
(Applauses)
<D>
(LT) Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the world is becoming more and more open, not just Europe.
Modern technologies and globalisation make it such and fighting this reality is counterproductive.
I congratulate France which, during its Presidency, took the important initiatives we are discussing today.
The interest of the European Union is clear: we lack, we need workers, as well as highly qualified specialists, because our citizens use their right to leave, live and work elsewhere, somewhere they prefer.
Legal immigration into the EU is a completely acceptable solution to the problem.
It is also our response to the challenges of globalisation and the EU aim of becoming more competitive.
I agree that the proposals must be coordinated with each other, coordinated with other legal acts, but there is no doubt that we had to solve these problems and I once again congratulate both rapporteurs and the presiding country.
<D>
Mr President, I would like to echo the comments of my colleague in thanking you, the staff and the interpreters for your kind patience as we seek to deliver these explanations of vote, which at times may be rather entertaining and at times rather boring for you.
I understand that.
But that is the great contrast in this place.
Now, let us talk about tax competition.
We talk about creating the world's largest single market here, and we talk about making the EU the most competitive economy in the world, and we talk about the world competition, yet what do we do when it comes to tax competition?
Well, as it actually says in the explanatory statement, the best way to address the problem of competition would be through full harmonisation.
So here we are, seeing competition as a problem, while at the same time talking about the need for a more competitive economy.
This should not be a competence of the EU.
It is a competence of Member States, and we should leave it as such, because the best way to ensure a competitive economy is to make sure that we have tax competition, not harmonisation.
<D>
Mr President, Mrs Berès, ladies and gentlemen, when the founding fathers of the European Union drafted the Treaty of Rome, they had the foresight to include, in one of its articles, a mechanism to help Member States whose balance of payments was seriously threatened.
That foresight in that article of the Treaty of Rome has been passed on through successive treaty reforms and is now in Article 119 of the current Treaty.
After many years of non-use, this legal basis has now been used by the Commission to assist a Member State which needed urgent help, namely Hungary.
This article of the Treaty was developed in a 2002 Regulation which is what we have used in the case of Hungary and which is what we are now proposing to amend with regard to the maximum ceiling of the amounts that can be made available to help Member States facing this kind of difficulty.
Yesterday we debated in this House the ten years of Economic and Monetary Union.
This afternoon we have debated the economic situation.
Yesterday and again today we have discussed the problems caused by this situation and, unfortunately, there are some EU Member States which are outside the euro area and whose macroeconomic and financial imbalances are putting them in a particularly vulnerable position, given market pressures.
In the case of Hungary and in light of these difficulties, at some point the Hungarian authorities contacted the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
Immediately after establishing contact with the IMF, they contacted the European Commission.
As I have said to the Hungarian authorities, this was not the right procedure for a Member State.
The logical procedure is firstly to contact the European authorities and then, if necessary - and in the case of Hungary, it undoubtedly was - to jointly contact the IMF.
I must say to you all that the IMF and its Managing Director, Mr Strauss-Kahn, have proved to be absolutely open to this cooperation between the IMF and the European Commission, the European authorities and the EU Member States which are members of the euro area and need to access the facilities provided by the IMF.
In the case of Hungary, we have acted in cooperation.
Although the procedure was not started correctly, the end result has been right as we have acted in cooperation.
The European Union is providing Hungary with EUR 6 500 million within a global aid package worth EUR 20 000 million.
This same approach, but in this case using the right procedure of firstly contacting the European authorities and then jointly contacting the IMF, is now being used in the case of another country.
Unfortunately, the situation is proving so difficult that this may not be the last case, or at least we should be prepared for there to be other cases, other Member States which need this type of help.
That is why, at the same time as we presented the Council with the proposal to help Hungary, by using Article 119 of the Treaty and the 2002 Regulation, we also presented a proposal to raise the maximum ceiling of the facility established by the 2002 Regulation to EUR 25 000 million.
Hopefully we will not have to use these funds, but we cannot rule out this possibility.
If we have to use them, then we must demonstrate our solidarity, as the founding fathers did in the Treaty of Rome in 1957, and we must also plan for a possible increase in the ceiling above EUR 25 000 million, if this proves necessary.
As a result, I would ask Parliament, when discussing this issue in the future, if this proves necessary, to show the same willingness that I am pleased to witness here today.
I would ask Parliament to give its opinion quickly and flexibly on help that, due to its very nature and characteristics, will be urgent.
There are elements in the motion for a resolution tabled by Parliament, together with the debate on the proposal to raise the ceiling of the balance of payments facility, with which I agree.
These involve concerns about the vulnerability of some of our Member States and about the need to assess how we can protect ourselves and protect those Member States affected by this particular vulnerability, as in the case of Hungary, but which may also arise in the case of other countries.
We have to make this defence of the stability of Member States' economies and financial positions compatible with the free movement of capital and with the principles on which the internal market is based.
However, we must be aware that we have to react to unnecessary risks and situations in which certain private interests may threaten the higher interests of Member State citizens and the economic and general security of our States.
I have taken due note of the suggestions made in this motion for a resolution.
We will assess these in the Commission and report our findings to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
As stated by Mrs Berès, these will also be conveyed to Mr De Larosière so that his group can present its findings within the period set for its work, in other words by March.

Member of the Commission. - Mr President, we have spoken a lot about listening to citizens, and I am very happy that at least some of you have stayed here to listen to myself and Prime Minister Janša, so that we can respond to the very interesting remarks that were made during this debate.
Naturally, the debate was also about the conclusions and the consequences of the 'no' vote in Ireland.
Let me make a point that I think will be very important for the future: let us not fall into the trap of Europe bashing - on bashing ourselves as European institutions.
That would be a real mistake.
No one will gain from that.
In fact, all the available data - all the objective surveys - show that in general the citizens of Europe have more trust in the European institutions - including the Commission - than in most national governments and certainly most political parties at national level.
Therefore, simply to identify the problem as a problem of confidence in the European institutions is intellectually dishonest.
By the way, according to our data and to what Prime Minister Cowen told us about Irish voters, Irish voters did not vote against Europe.
In fact, 80% of 'no' voters said they were in favour of Europe.
They may have some criticisms of this or that aspect but, according to the Irish authorities and to all our available data, this cannot be seen just as a vote against Europe.
Therefore, let us not put the blame on Europe.
Let us be modest; let us understand what our shortcomings are; let us accept the criticism; let us make our work better in Brussels or in Strasbourg, but let us not simply put the blame on Europe and let us try to understand that today the responsibilities of power - be it at European, national, regional or local level - are huge and that we have to face this with a sense of modesty but not giving in to populistic, easy arguments.
The image of the European Union is determined by the decisions taken - not by proposals made.
Decisions are taken by the Council and the European Parliament - not by the Commission.
What hurts Europe very often is the caricature of its decision-making; what hurts Europe is the attacks on the European institutions, made sometimes even by some very committed Europeans; what hurts Europe is very often the caricature not only of our institutions but also of our policies.
Let me just give you an example.
You have all heard the story of the straight cucumbers.
It is very popular in Germany and in some other countries.
For ages Europe has been ridiculed for prescribing the marketing standards for cucumbers.
Well, my Commission has proposed to get rid of them, in a review including 35 other marketing standards for food and vegetables that we find are unnecessary.
Our idea is to retain just 10 out of 35 of those standards.
But guess what?
When we sounded out the Member States, a clear majority was against this change.
That is the reality.
It is not really Brussels nannying the Member States is it?
Well, we will not stop; we will put forward the proposal to get rid of these unnecessary standards.
Then it will be time to put up or shut up with regard to bureaucracy coming from Brussels.
If there is one thing worse than the bureaucracy from Brussels it is 27 national bureaucracies coming to Brussels to ask for the reinforcement of legislation at Brussels level.
Therefore, let us fight unnecessary bureaucracy and let us respect the principle of subsidiarity; but let us do it not against European institutions but because we want to be closer to our citizens.
During the debate mention was made of the Soil Directive.
It was presented as an example of over-regulation by Brussels.
Let me remind you that in November 2007 it was this Parliament that voted by a large majority at first reading in favour of the Soil Directive.
So what do you want?
If someone asked me as Commission President to ignore the vote of the European Parliament, I could not do it.
So whether this directive becomes law is now in the hands of the co-legislators.
I would like all pro-Europeans not to hide behind the Commission if the majority in the European Parliament votes differently to what some of you would like.
The same applies to the Return Directive.
I heard the Chairman of one Group criticising the Return Directive, just adopted by this Parliament, and presenting it as one of the problems of legitimacy of the European Union.
Let us be frank: if the European institutions themselves call into question the legislation that they themselves have adopted, then we really have a problem regarding support by our citizens.
This is important because at national level when a political party or a political leader does not agree with a particular decision on legislation, it does not question the legitimacy of the nation, of the state or of the national democracies, but I find very often in Europe that when some politicians do not agree with a particular policy they try to call the whole legitimacy of our European process into question.
This is unacceptable and it is not an honest way if we want to go ahead with our European project.
The same applies to the caricature of social and liberal.
We are now advancing the debate in the European Council of whether or not to address the immediate concerns of the most vulnerable people in our society.
The response of the Commission was clear: let us do it.
There are the people who are most in need and we need to act for them now and, if there are some European instruments, then let us use them, adding to what we have at national level.
I believe it is possible to have both a structural response and an immediate response.
I believe it is possible to be in favour of both market and social policies.
I believe that sometimes the European camp is divided unnecessarily by an artificial division between those who favour more market orientation and those who favour more social orientation.
I think that is quite possible to be in favour of an internal market, against state interventionism that distorts competition but, at the same time, to be against ultra-liberalism that distorts solidarity.
It is perfectly possible to do both things at a European level and not to deepen ideological differences which, if we do not handle them correctly, will only help populists at the extremes in their stance against the European project.
We must have a debate on those issues if we want to go on with confidence with our European project.
I believe that allocating blame to the European institutions is pointless and self-defeating for all those who believe in the European ideal.
Let me tell you also very frankly that, as has often happened in the history of European integration, every time there is a setback some national politicians use it to try to reduce the role of the European institutions and to try to weaken the role of the Commission.
Some even suggest that the Commission should not speak out for what it believes in.
I will not accept that.
The Commission will stand firm for the competences of the Community and for Community matters.
We will stand against any attempt to reduce European competence, because I really believe that the problem is not that we have too many European competences but that those politicians who should be defending European ideals and the European project lack conviction.
My plea is that we stand up for our values: that all those working here in the European institutions in Brussels - proudly in Brussels - or in our capitals or all over Europe should unite in a spirit of partnership between all our institutions and the Member States to explain why more than ever we need Europe.
Let us not apologise for defending the Lisbon Treaty that tries to reinforce accountability, democracy, the coherence and effectiveness of our Union.
Let us tell our European citizens with courage that the 'no' vote in Ireland did not solve the problem that the Lisbon Treaty was intended to solve, that there is tough competition out there, that the world will not wait for Europe and that the world needs a Europe that is more than ever present, not only for the benefit of its citizens but also for the promotion of its values.
<D>
The introduction of a financial transaction tax is a step in the right direction and would mainly affect hedge funds and similar products, which would seem to be of very little benefit to the real economy.
It is doubtless right for Europe to take the lead here - after all, we would have to wait indefinitely if we were to try to bring the Americans on board too.
However, a financial transaction tax should not be used as an opportunity to introduce an EU tax by the back door.
Unfortunately, however, Mrs Podimata's report takes us in precisely that direction.
Fiscal sovereignty must remain with the Member States.
If Brussels cannot manage on the money it gets, then it needs to tighten its belt.
There are enough powers already that could be better regulated at a national level than at EU level.
The other calls contained in the report, namely for the introduction of Eurobonds and a carbon tax, should be rejected.
On the one hand, Eurobonds are a product that goes against all economic sense, while on the other, fiscally prudent euro area countries are once again unfairly required to pay the price.
The EU would simply become a transfer union.
Also, a carbon tax with dubious objectives would damage Europe's economy and destroy jobs and would thus have a negative impact on most people.
For this reason, the report should be rejected.
<D>
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, the atrocious fighting in the east of the Congo is not simply a case of a civil war, it is also a regional conflict involving many neighbouring countries.
It is also about strategic raw materials such as coltan, which we need for the production of our mobile phones, DVD players and computers.
It is also about gold, diamonds, cobalt and precious wood.
These are the deeper causes of this conflict.
What can and what must be done?
The United Nations must be beefed up so that it is capable of meeting its responsibility to protect the civilian population from all the armed troops active in the region.
The United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUC) needs a clearer mandate, more equipment and more manpower.
The Member States of the European Union have repeatedly waived away the pleas to re-supply MONUC in recent years.
Yet we have then seen sharp criticism of MONUC's failures and mistakes.
This case of double standards must be brought to an end.
We do not need a branded EU military contingent right now, we need MONUC to be actively re-supplied and I have listened with interest and approval to how this is also the way that the Council and the Commission wish to go.
The second important point to be made is that the extraction of, and trade in, raw materials from Congo must be monitored strictly and on an international basis.
The international corporations involved in this trade that profit from the extraction of the raw materials in Congo must be monitored and compelled to be transparent.
There is, of course, already an official UN Panel of experts on the illegal exploitation of natural resources from Congo.
This panel of experts has put forward a series of recommendations, including sanctions against people and businesses who participate in such illegal exploitation.
The European Union must push for the implementation of this UN recommendation, including, specifically - and this in an area where there is scope for action - insofar as relates to imports into the EU, as this is clearly an area in which we can act on our own and one where we can actively implement these UN recommendations.
The third point to be made is that the initiative for an international conference on the Great Lakes region must be brought forward.
Only political cooperation and the economic integration of the region can provide peace there in the long term.
Europe can, and must, play a key role in this.
<D>
(LV) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his clear and unambiguous position, which, on the basis of the results of scientific studies, acknowledges that global warming is really happening and that it is caused by humans.
We ought to remember that a few years ago many influential politicians, including leaders of certain major powers, were still trying to deny this.
The report goes a step further and rejects, as scientifically unfounded, statements to the effect that global warming is not occurring and that these are only natural variations in temperature.
This report once again demonstrates that the EU is a world leader with respect to global warming.
This is no cause for elation, however.
In order to keep global warming within the bounds of 2%, according to current estimates the volume of CO2 emissions will need to be reduced by at least half by 2050.
In this context, the statement in the report to the effect that nearly all the EU Member States have made good progress in meeting the Kyoto targets is over-optimistic.
In the period from 1990 to 2005 the 15 older EU Member States reduced their emissions by only 2%, and it is very unlikely that in the remaining five years they will reduce their emissions by a further 6%, in order to achieve their collective Kyoto target.
It is only thanks to the fact that the newer EU Member States have reduced their emissions considerably more quickly that the EU as a whole can claim world leader status in this sphere.
It is expected that the newer EU Member States will reduce their CO2 emissions by 21% by 2010.
It is only this fact that enables the EU leaders to talk about the apparently ambitious target of reducing emissions by 20% by 2020.
Of course, this target is to be welcomed, but it is important that the largest polluters should achieve the greater part of this reduction.
It is not acceptable to allow the efforts of EU climate change policies to be based only on the existing achievements of the newer Member States and isolated older ones, and to place an additional burden on them, while at the same time making allowances for the largest polluters.
Regardless of the allocation of emissions reductions among the EU Member States, however, we will not achieve anything unless worldwide agreement is reached and countries such as the United States, China, India, Russia and others are involved in solving the problem.
This issue must be a priority in EU foreign policy and climate change policy.
Thank you for your attention.
<D>
(RO) In the context of the European Union consumer protection strategy, I would like to mention the importance of quality of services and products.
If consumers are already used to resorting to consumer protection offices in relation to products, this does not happen when it comes to services.
Many times, consumers sign contracts for the supply of services without reading the contractual provisions carefully and if they do read them carefully they believe they cannot propose any amendments thereof.
In fact, they do not have the same power of negotiation the suppliers of services have, although some observations from consumers could improve the content of contracts and increase their confidence.
I would like to draw attention to the need to protect tourists and passengers as regards compliance with their rights which, unfortunately, many of them do not know and claim.
Special attention should be given to electronic services as well.
The consumers' confidence in digital services is essential for the European Union's competitiveness and, especially, for the development of economy based on knowledge.
In conclusion, I would like to mention the fact that we also have to speak about the quality of public services and, in this context, about consumer protection.
<D>
For the last month, 'failure' has been the word most used to describe the Copenhagen Summit.
The summit's unsatisfactory outcome is due to both the reticence shown by the large industrialised countries and the system's complicated rules based on the UN's consensus.
Furthermore, the European Union's inability to assume the role of catalyst for the global efforts to restrict the effects of climate change should be examined.
By announcing unilaterally a year before this conference its intention to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020, the EU had the moral upper hand to provide a fillip to the negotiations in Copenhagen.
However, we did not know how to make our voice heard in a meeting dominated by the positions of the US and emerging countries.
A more restricted format of discussions is required so that we can hope for negotiations ending in success.
The ministerial meetings in Bonn and Mexico City in June and December must be used as effectively as possible to leave the way open for adopting a new treaty.
Member States must coordinate their actions so that we speak with a single voice on the global stage.
<D>
in writing. - (PT) We believe that a framework for cooperation between Member States must be established for preventing, combating and minimising the consequences of disasters.
Among other aspects, however, we disagree with the creation of a European civil protection force (particularly if it has a military dimension), since capacities and operational resources in this area must be subject to the jurisdiction of Member States, which have to guarantee the resources and strategies to provide a (rapid) response to needs and which know their territory better.
We consider the approval of our proposals advocating the following to be positive:
Community-level recognition of the specific nature of Mediterranean region natural disasters such as drought and forest fires, and the resulting adaptation of Community instruments in terms of prevention, research, risk management, civil protection and solidarity in order to improve each Member State's response;
The need for greater Community funding of prevention measures.
However, we regret the rejection of our proposals:
Highlighting the importance of maintaining the eligibility of regional disasters for the European Solidarity Fund;
Advocating the adaptation of the European Solidarity Fund to the specific nature of natural disasters such as drought and fires, in terms of time limits and eligible actions.
<D>
in writing. - (GA) Irish soldiers are famed for their involvement in peace-keeping operations with the United Nations in places where there is crisis or conflict.
It should be the United Nations who leads the way in terms of peace-keeping operations, but this cannot be achieved by participation in European battle groups of this kind.
There is a particular problem with participation in the EUFOR group in Chad.
France has a central role in this force.
Yet, other French soldiers are giving support to Idriss Déby, the President of Chad, who has been heavily criticised by Amnesty International.
In addition, Chad is a former colony of France.
There is a danger that Irish forces will be perceived as a supporting force for a government whose human rights record has come under suspicion.
There is a danger that Ireland will no longer be perceived as neutral.
An international force is needed to support those who are in difficulty in Chad, but it should really be a United Nation's force.
<D>
Mr President, I rise here as - I hope - one of the ordinary and decent citizens of Ireland referred to by my colleague MEP, Mr Farage - although I think he has left the Chamber.
I am not surprised that ordinary, decent Irish citizens are confused, because they have strange bedfellows on the 'no' side - Ms McDonald and Mr Farage.
It beggars belief!
Could I say to Sinn Féin in particular: can they not acknowledge the role of the European Union in peace in Northern Ireland?
That is what will be enhanced by this Treaty, not 'militarisation', as they call it.
On the role of national parliaments, can I say this: let national parliaments take the power this Treaty will give them and let the ordinary decent citizens of the countries force them to use that power effectively.
To Mr Duff: there is falsehood being peddled in Ireland on the 'self-amending' Treaty: it is the invention of a negative mind.
It is not true and it is not so.
Lastly, let me say that, contrary to the naysayers, like Ms McDonald and Mr Farage, this Treaty is a good deal for Ireland, a good deal for the EU, a good deal for Europe, and I urge citizens in Ireland to vote 'yes'!
<D>
rapporteur. - Madam President, firstly I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs who have been very willing to work with me on what is an incredibly technical and difficult dossier.
By working together we have been able to come up with what I believe is a good compromise.
I would also like to thank the Commission for their cooperation, and we look forward to working with them on this dossier in the future.
I would also like to thank Patrick Baragiola from the AGRI secretariat and my adviser Dan Dalton.
Animal testing is a highly controversial area and involves a moral dilemma.
Is it ever right to test on animals in order to potentially save the lives of humans?
I believe that, as long as tests are properly justified from both the scientific and ethical perspective, then it is.
However, we must do everything we can to minimise both the number of tests and the amount of suffering imposed upon animals.
The Commission report was a good start.
It showed that the Commission is keen on moving towards an end to animal experimentation whenever possible.
However, in many areas the Commission proposal was ambiguous and may have the opposite effect to that which the Commission is seeking.
The omission of definitions of a severity classification was a glaring hole in the whole proposal.
The Commission was in effect asking Parliament to make a judgement on the rules surrounding the classifications without knowing what they actually were.
In addition, some provisions, particularly the recommendations on the reuse of animals and on the proposed use of only F2 primates (second-generation primates) are likely to mean that many more animals will have to be used.
In the case of F2 primates, no feasibility study has been done to see whether it is possible to do what the Commission is proposing.
Their impact assessment only looks at numbers; it does not look into the welfare implications.
For this reason, Parliament urgently needed to amend the proposal: not to weaken it but to make it clear exactly when testing on animals should be allowed and under what circumstances.
I believe that the AGRI Committee report strikes a compromise between ensuring that research can continue in the EU and improving animal welfare.
From an animal welfare perspective it is a step forward.
It is all about promoting alternatives to animal experimentation through a financial commitment, more emphasis on the three 'R's and the strengthening of the role of ECVAM.
In addition I have also proposed regular thematic reviews of primate experiments to identify and phase out those experiments which are not necessary.
It is also a step forward for medical research.
It will update the current outdated legislation and will allow medical research to continue as and when that research is scientifically and ethically justified.
I believe that this is fundamentally important.
We also want to see animal tests reduced.
However, European citizens quite rightly demand that the best and more effective medicines are available.
Reliable European research and development is essential.
Vaccines for polio, German measles, hepatitis B, diphtheria, measles, mumps, rubella and meningitis, along with combined therapy drugs for HIV, medicines to control asthma, life support systems for premature babies and deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease, have all been developed through experimentation on animals, and specifically primates.
Many millions of lives have been saved or improved as a result.
Until we have alternatives in place, I believe that it would be unwise to outlaw these types of experiments, either directly or indirectly through poorly worded legislation.
This directive will set out the framework to ensure that we can phase out animal testing as soon as alternative methods are available.
It significantly improves the search for alternatives and puts us firmly on the path to one day phasing out animal testing altogether.
We have a good compromise in the AGRI Committee.
However, the Liberal group appears to be trying to drive a coach and horses through this agreement.
I would urge them not to vote against this report, because it will set back animal welfare by several years and it would be completely wrong for them to take this action.
<D>
The demographic deficit and ageing of the European Union's population put us at risk of the labour market, health care and pension systems being jeopardised.
In this situation, the Blue Card will act as a counterbalance to the US Green Card system, which has proven to be a real success, bearing in mind that approximately 50% of highly qualified workers choose either the US or Canadian market.
I believe that it is vital for us to have a uniform immigration system for all 27 Member States so that every state in the European Union can benefit from the added value contributed by a highly qualified workforce.
It seems to me just as important that the EU gives these professionals the recognition they are due by offering them fair and non-discriminatory salaries.
Before I end, I would very much like to mention the fact, however, that the EU's labour market is not fully open yet to workers from the new Member States.
We therefore need to be very careful that the measures we adopt do not discriminate against de facto citizens of the European Union.
<D>
Madam President, as one of the other co-sponsors of the original written declaration nearly three years ago, which called for this ban, I should like to congratulate everyone who has worked to bring this draft proposal forward.
Four hundred and twenty-five Members of this House signed that declaration, reflecting the strength of feeling about the issue, not only among MEPs but also among our constituents.
Today, nearly one million seals are slaughtered annually in commercial seal kills around the world, and when we vote on this package tomorrow we will be helping to end one of the most vile examples of animal cruelty.
I am very glad that compromises, like the proposed labelling system, have been strongly rejected, so that we can fully meet the demands of millions of European citizens.
A positive vote will be a vote for ending cruelty.
It will also be a vote and a victory for all of us who have refused to take 'no' for an answer.
I well remember many meetings with Commission officials when we were told that a ban would be simply impossible.
Well, this just shows that when we can galvanise sufficient political will - and I pay tribute to the NGOs which have helped us to do so - then impossible things become possible, and I am delighted that they do.
<D>
(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, we usually say that we are a Union whose basic principle is solidarity.
Today our citizens need a Union which can put this principle into practice.
They need actions, not just words.
Today we call on the Council to take account of the citizens' expectations and show that it is up to the job as far as the Solidarity Fund is concerned.
All of us in our countries have experienced the effects of what are frequently occurring natural disasters.
We have all witnessed the despair of our fellow citizens who have been affected and we all know and understand how important it is for these citizens to feel that the European Union is standing by them.
In May 2006, the European Parliament adopted the European Commission's plan for a new Solidarity Fund, a new, faster and more flexible and effective fund, which it was planning to implement in the period 2007-2013, but which has so far been collecting dust on the Council's desk.
I honestly cannot understand how we can possibly have such a good instrument and yet not implement it.
The European Union needs the new Solidarity Fund now more than ever.
<D>
(NL) I should like to say to Mr Swoboda that a political party has in fact already been banned in Europe.
I am talking about Belgium, where Vlaams Blok, the largest Flemish party, was actually banned in 2005.
Obviously that is no excuse for Turkey to ban political parties as well.
Having said that, I am astounded, Madam President, that the Council and the Commission are satisfied with the cosmetic changes to the notorious Article 301 in the Turkish Penal Code, which will still put just as many restrictions on freedom of expression.
It is now a punishable offence to insult 'the Turkish nation', rather than 'insulting Turkishness'.
It is simply a question of semantics, which can still lead to actual prison sentences.
Article 301 does not need to be amended, it needs to be abolished, along with all legal provisions that conflict with freedom of expression and democratic fundamental rights.
If that is not done, the negotiations must simply be stopped, as has always been promised.
It was promised that the negotiating process would keep pace with reforms in Turkey.
Well, that is really not the case, certainly since it is already believed that two new chapters are to be opened shortly.
If the European Union approves cosmetic improvements like this, it loses all credibility and the whole of the rest of the negotiating process becomes a grotesque farce.
<D>
(BG) We ought to come up with a combination of solutions, a general model and principles.
The report makes this clear in an excellent way.
To protect the environment is cheaper than to rehabilitate it, but the failure to use fair market tools means to provide hidden subsidies to polluters.
The green toolbox needs flexibility if we are to have certainty and make sure we do not default on other indicators and increase the burden for citizens.
Trade instruments need to be combined with promoting investment in new technology, with offsetting instruments for overcoming deficits.
Individual countries do matter.
Bulgaria, for example, will be facing problems in the future.
The closing down of certain parts of the nuclear power plant in Kozloduy lead to an increase in generation at thermal power plants, electricity prices went up.
This increases emissions, yet the low GHG allowances work like penalties and consumers are paying the increased price.
Unless carbon dioxide allowance are reallocated and in the absence of sufficient compensation to off-set the decommissioned power units, the application of the other trade instruments will bring about more problems.
Environmental economics has its social dimensions and we should not wait until 2010 or 2013 before we act.
<D>
Ladies and gentlemen, in connection with the situation in Lebanon, diplomatic activities of the European Union and the Member States remain focused on advancing the cause of peace, stability, economic development and respect for human rights in Lebanon.
We are making efforts to preserve and strengthen the sovereignty, political independence, territorial integrity, unity and stability of Lebanon.
The European Union upholds the Lebanese democratic institutions and the legitimate government of the Prime Minister, Fouad Siniora.
However, we are concerned because of the long-term paralysis of the Lebanese institutions.
This has been going on since November 2006, and when in November 2007 the President's position became vacant, the paralysis became even more critical.
Apart from being the largest financial donor to Lebanon, the European Union has been making efforts through intensive diplomatic activities also to find a solution for the country's political paralysis.
Within this framework we support the efforts of the United Nations, Saudi Arabia and the Arab League.
Thus the European Union upheld the three-part plan, which the foreign ministers of the Arab League unanimously adopted.
As is well known, this plan envisages the immediate election of a president, the forming of a government of national unity, and the adoption of a new elections act.
In spite of expressing support for this plan, the Lebanese political parties differ in their interpretation of its execution.
There are two main obstacles for the realisation of the proposal.
The first one is internal, because the parties cannot reach an agreement regarding their representation in the government, the sharing of ministerial posts, and the new law on elections.
The second obstacle is connected with Syria, which refuses to give up its influence in Lebanon.
In spite of everything, the plan of the Arab League is, at this point in time, still the only initiative which can contribute to the resolution of the political impasse in the country.
We expect that the General Secretary of the Arab League, Mr Moussa, will continue with his efforts to resolve the existing situation.
In this respect the European Union will provide him with every support.
The recent summit of the Arab League, held in Damascus at the end of March, regretfully did not bring the desired results required for the resolution of the situation.
Because of Syria's interference in the presidential election procedure, Lebanon expressed its protest by not sending their representative to the summit.
In connection with this, I should like to emphasise the commitment of the European Union to the viewpoints set out in a number United Nations Security Council resolutions.
Another demonstration of the European Union's support of the efforts of the United Nations is its participation in the UN mission in Lebanon.
Member States have contributed the largest share of the military force in Lebanon.
Despite numerous attacks, during which six members of the Spanish contingent were killed and three Irish soldiers were wounded, the mission has been successful, and in August 2007 it was extended for another year.
European Union Member States also support the establishment of the special United Nations Court for Lebanon in the Netherlands.
Also worth mentioning is that in 2007 the EU-Lebanon Action Plan came into effect.
This instrument is an upgrading of the existing cooperation within the framework of the Euro-Mediterranean Committee for the Barcelona Process, and activities within this framework have already commenced.
<D>
A month and a half before the summit in Copenhagen, and in view of unavoidable climate change, the world expects us to take specific action - action which demonstrates responsibility and careful thought in relation to working together on behalf of people and their safety.
We are all familiar with the reports of the International Panel on Climate Change, which clearly state that most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is the result of human activity.
Climate issues have become the geopolitical and economic priority of the 21st century, a priority which requires decisions that are both bold and based on long-term measures.
To achieve world consensus, it is necessary to define climate treaties which will build new models for the reduction of greenhouse gases after 2012.
The Kyoto Protocol was the first step to changing the mentality of world governments on the question of environmental protection.
We should continue with this way of thinking.
The point is, however, that we cannot confine ourselves to reducing the greenhouse gas emissions of developed countries such as the USA and China.
It is essential to support smaller, poorer countries, which have problems with the introduction of alternative, green energy sources.
This is not only a matter of financial support, but also of education and sharing experience in the creation of green economies.
When making decisions, we should also think of the citizens.
We should inform and educate them, and persuade them to invest in protecting the environment.
As with every political measure in the area of safety, the support and cooperation of the citizens is indispensable.
<D>
in writing. - (SV) This own-initiative report highlights fisheries and aquaculture within the context of Integrated Coastal Zone Management in Europe.
Ecologically sustainable management of aquatic and fisheries resources is naturally important for protecting the environment in which we live.
Unfortunately, the report ignores the problems which the fisheries sector in the EU brings with it.
Therefore we have chosen to abstain.
Overcapacity in the fishing fleets in the EU is leading to far too large catches.
This threatens the marine ecosystem and edible fish stocks.
We would like to see a major reduction in fishing vessels, and fishing quotas which are set on the basis of biologically safe and scientific grounds.
Of course, the employees affected by the restructuring must be offered labour market training and reasonable financial support in order to be able to take work in other parts of the economy which need labour.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - I fully agree with you, and this is a very responsible position.
I am very glad that you are going to be the rapporteur for this very important piece of legislation.
Of course, we discussed everything.
I remember that in Nairobi we had a specific discussion on this issue.
We discussed it in my services, with other services and with other Commissioners, and what we concluded as being a wise, balanced position is to include in the proposal a provision which will take care of the problems that energy-intensive sectors could face in the event that we do not have an international agreement, or that an international agreement does not impose carbon constraints in other countries as ambitious as the European Union's.
What we have decided is that, by 2010, we shall identify with objective criteria which are these sectors, and by June 2011 we shall assess the situation of whether we have an international agreement or even international sectoral agreements.
Accordingly, I hope, and I sincerely believe, that we will have an agreement by the end of 2009, one which will tackle climate change problems effectively.
However, if we do not have an agreement, or if it is not ambitious enough, then there are provisions in our proposal that permit us to assess the situation and, accordingly, either provide emissions allowances for up to 100% of the allocations of these energy-intensive industries or permit the inclusion of importers into our emissions trading system and, of course, the obligation to pay for similar amounts of allowances as local producers will do, so equalising the situation - or even a combination of these measures.
Therefore, we are giving the necessary assurance to our industries that we will be looking at the problems.
At the same time, we are giving a warning to other countries: they had better agree on an international agreement.
Therefore, by having this very balanced position, we are achieving all the objectives, and I hope that Parliament and the Council will vote on and adopt the legislation as soon as possible, by the end of the year or early next spring.
<D>
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, and on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on her work, for trying to find a consensus with the shadow rapporteurs and for the efforts made to try to reach the desired agreement between the parties.
The proposal for a Regulation on flavourings aims to clarify and update the rules on the use of flavourings and food ingredients with flavouring properties taking into account technological and scientific progress in the area of flavouring, developments in food legislation in the European Union and, at the same time, human health protection requirements.
The Regulation lays down the general conditions for the use of flavourings or food ingredients with flavouring properties, it includes a clear definition of flavourings, general rules for their use, rules on labelling and maximum levels for substances that pose a risk to human health.
The compromise reached in this second reading process is the result of cooperation between the Commission, the Council and Parliament.
Several meetings have been held, the more controversial points have been negotiated and there have been concessions from all sides.
The agreement nevertheless reflects the principles of various amendments put forward by Parliament, which take into account two key objectives: informing consumers and protecting their interests, as well as protecting public health.
Flavourings and flavouring substances must be safe and their use should not mislead consumers.
In this context, the new legislation lays down maximum levels for certain substances in flavourings and food ingredients with flavouring properties that are potentially toxic and of risk to human health, taking the European Food Safety Authority's scientific opinions into consideration.
These maximum levels do not apply to three substances: estragole, safrole and methyleugenol, when present in compound foods to which no flavourings have been added and only food ingredients with flavouring properties in the form of herbs and/or spices have been added.
Nevertheless, this exception shall be reviewed should scientific evidence come to light proving that their consumption carries health risks.
The notion of natural is still confusing for consumers but the new proposal for labelling natural flavourings does correspond more effectively to consumers' expectations as use of the term natural is limited to flavourings obtained from natural flavouring substances where at least 95% of the flavouring component must be obtained from the natural source referred to.
<D>
Mr President, 2008 was an extremely important year for the European and indeed the global economy.
It was the year that was characterised by a great deal of uncertainty as regards the extent of the crisis, which only seemed to worsen.
A great deal of uncertainty was also present with regard to the time it would take for the European economies to recover as well as the tools that we should use to stimulate such a recovery.
This was no easy year for the ECB, which had to face a number of challenges.
During 2008, the ECB engaged with other major central banks to form a coordinated approach in order to provide the banking system with plenty of short-term liquidity, and this approach by the ECB proved to be extremely successful.
In this respect, I must support my colleague in the conclusion he has come to concerning the performance of the ECB.
I agree that 2008 was instrumental and that those responsible have risen to this occasion.
I also share some of the rapporteur's concerns with regard to the lack of transmission of interest rate cuts from the bank to the consumer and I feel that this should be further looked into, so please take note, Mr Trichet.
All in all, I feel that this is an extremely well-balanced report, an excellent piece of work by my Maltese colleague, Edward Scicluna.
<D>
on behalf of ALDE Group. - (ET) Commissioner, President, colleagues.
Rapporteur Mrs Bauer stated that poverty has a woman's face.
I must also reiterate that even in 1957, Article 119 of the Treaty of Rome contained the principle that men and women should receive equal pay for equal work.
Today however, in the year 2008, women in the European Union earn on average 15% less than men, and in my home country Estonia they earn as much as 25% less than men.
The wage disparity significantly influences women's position in economic and social life, both during and after their active working lives.
It also intensifies women's risk of poverty, especially in families with single parents.
The wage disparity between men and women often leads to differences in men's and women's pensions.
Single female pensioners often live in risk of poverty.
As a result, I welcome the position proposed in the report, that is, that the European Commission should present a legislative proposal concerning the examination of current legislation concerning the principles of equal payment for men and women by 31 December 2009.
We have passed too much legislation and waited too long, but the results are not very good.
As time has shown, this problem cannot be solved with European Union legislation alone.
One significant outlet for the solution of the problem would be for the topic to be prioritised in political action plans.
Only an effective combination of policies that includes better and more effective legislation and designates the responsible party will make it possible to find a positive solution to this problem.
I would like to thank the rapporteur for pointing out very important aspects in the report, and thank you for your attention.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - The European Union is a major actor in the Middle East peace process, both politically and practically.
At a political level, the European Union's role is founded on strong bilateral relations with all partners in this important region.
The European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) has provided the framework for these bilateral relations, which can be tailored to each country's needs.
ENP meetings provide a platform for regular, in-depth and robust discussion of various issues, including those relating to the Middle East peace process.
The European Union has used ENP meetings with Israel and the Palestinians to address different aspects: political issues, discussions of specific human rights cases, the situation on the ground, our assistance work, etc.
In each case, the ENP framework has helped to consolidate a regular flow of information and sharing of views.
At a practical level, the European Union designs its substantial support for this region as a result of bilateral consultations in the ENP framework.
For example, the European Union is a major contributor to Palestinian state-building efforts and to relief efforts for the refugee population throughout the Middle East.
In parallel to close bilateral relations, the European Union has consistently supported a multilateral approach to the Middle East peace process.
The Union for the Mediterranean offers another forum where the Middle East Peace Process can be discussed by all partners in this region.
In addition, the European Union - along with the United States, Russia and the United Nations - is a member of the Quartet, which is supporting the current proximity talks between Israel and the Palestinians.
At its meeting of 19 March 2010, the Quartet indicated that a peace deal covering all final status issues should be completed within 24 months.
<D>
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in Office of the Council, we welcome the fact that the Council has finally given the European Commission a mandate to negotiate with the United States on the inclusion in the Visa Waiver Programme of the 12 countries that were currently excluded.
It is also a good sign that, in parallel to these negotiations, negotiations are being opened on the Electronic System of Travel Authorisation and the exchange of data.
However, will this mandate really make it possible to call a halt to bilateral negotiations, in favour of a truly European approach?
Let us hope so.
I would remind you again that no bilateral negotiations are acceptable on visa exemption and any negotiation of exchanges of data with the United States, such as PNR, and that only agreements at European Union level can be considered.
Does this negotiating mandate also provide for a general agreement on personal data protection?
That is what I want to ask, because the American legislation still excludes Europeans and does not protect them.
Finally, I should like to point out that the SIS and VIS were set up for specific purposes and that opening up access to the data in those systems to third countries would breach the principles of purpose and proportionality.
We are thus relying on you.
<D>
rapporteur. - Mr President, there are no amendments to the common position.
That is thanks to the excellent work between the Parliament, Council and Commission and the work particularly of my shadows, Mrs Wallis and Mr Gauzès of the PPE-DE Group, who took a very strong line with the Council and Commission.
I think it has been over a year since we agreed this proposal but it is the mediation experts and professionals in this sector whose response to the Parliament's first ever online consultation convinced us of the merits of this law.
I know that they will now welcome today's vote in bringing these proposals into legislation.
Too often we see cases where a marriage or a relationship involving children goes wrong and constituents end up with years of court procedures and massive legal fees.
One of my constituents with a Greek partner amassed legal bills and had to go through the court system for three years to get her children back.
Mediation can therefore be a valuable tool for citizens to achieve access to justice and potentially reduce the cost of dispute resolution without the often acrimonious process of going to trial.
It has the added benefit of freeing up court time for cases that require a court judgment.
This new law should assist people across Europe in getting quick, affordable access to justice.
I therefore urge Members to support the second reading and open up new avenues of redress and remedies for citizens across the EU.
(Applause)
<D>
(NL) Congratulations to the rapporteur, Mr Van Hecke, for a good report.
I also thank the Commissioner for a particularly sound staff working paper for Accra.
Three points.
Firstly, more effective aid indeed requires the donor countries to coordinate their aid better on the basis of a country strategy in which the partner countries in the south take the lead.
However, that means that the priorities also have to be decided democratically in those countries, that is to say in cooperation with national parliaments and NGOs, which does not happen at the moment.
It seems to me absolutely essential to involve women in the dialogue.
Secondly, donor countries absolutely have to stop imposing innumerable conditions on aid and staking a lot on measurable results.
The economic conditions imposed by the IMF and the World Bank in particular have to go, because they often conflict with the Millennium Goals.
I therefore say to the rapporteur that paragraph 28 in the report should go.
Thirdly, better aid is no excuse for less aid.
At the moment not only is development aid falling, the figures are also confused by what is supposedly aid but is not really much help to the partner countries, such as money paid to students or refugees in Europe or cancellation of debts.
It is therefore crucial for the donor countries to stick to their promises of the 0.7% and decide on concrete timetables.
I hope, Commissioner, that the Council on Monday listens to this message.
<D>
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Since 1977, most financial services, including insurance and investment fund management, have been exempt from VAT.
During this period, two problems have essentially arisen: the definition of the scope of the exemption and the impossibility of recovering VAT incurred in order to provide exempt services, giving rise to the phenomenon of hidden VAT.
Globalisation, European financial integration and market consolidation, which have affected the organisation and outsourcing of operations to provide these services, have further added to the complexities.
This report is the first attempt to update a directive which, in addition to being confusing - leading to the intervention of the European Court of Justice - is obsolete.
I want to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Muscat, on his excellent work in producing this report on an issue which is so economically sensitive and technically complex.
His proposals to modernise the definition of insurance and financial services, which are consistent with the Financial Services Action Plan and strict in dealing with exemptions, have merited general acceptance.
His commitment to preventing price rises for consumers as a result of taxable persons opting for taxation has also merited general approval.
The final result, encompassing a specific exemption from VAT for businesses involved in cost-sharing arrangements, will increase certainty for the industry and budgetary security for the Member States, prevent competition distortions and improve competitiveness for the banks and insurers without increasing the costs to consumers.
I want to express my satisfaction at the incorporation of two aspects contained in these amendments: the reference to co-insurance, and the improved definition of the concept of intermediation, which is restricted to professional activities rendered as a distinct, direct or indirect act of mediation and which specifies that intermediaries are not counterparties to the subsequent transactions.
I want to end by wishing Mr Muscat great success.
I am confident that he will soon be enjoying this success through his participation in European integration from the Council.
<D>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to thank the Vice-President, Mr Tajani, for some of the clarifications he has given, and I would like to respond immediately to his request.
He is asking this Parliament if we want to examine this proposal together: the answer is yes.
The oral question stems from this demand of ours.
We would like to examine it while having at our disposal all the information needed in order to understand, as you rightly wonder, whether this tool is a necessity and above all whether it is safe and respects citizens' privacy, which is our priority.
We welcome the letter that you sent to Mr Deprez, chairman of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, in which you make a commitment that we would like to take as an official commitment.
That is the commitment to consult the European Data Protection Supervisor.
Our group does not yet have an official view regarding body scanners: we need more information and to examine the issue more thoroughly.
Meanwhile, with regard to health, we would like to understand what actually constitutes an exposure overdose, particularly for frequent flyers, and on this point we need to be certain that the information is reliable, because for many years we have been forced to leave liquids behind, and now we discover that it was probably an excessive precaution and that the information and the assessments were probably unfounded.
We need an assessment of the principle of proportionality and the full involvement of the European Parliament.
We do not believe that these measures can be seen merely as technical ones: they are measures that have a direct impact on human rights and on privacy.
It is complicated to combine security, privacy and the protection of passenger health, but that is the responsibility that this Parliament endorses and which it entrusts to you.
We hope that we can have this information and that you and the European Data Protection Supervisor will give it to us.
We need some more data in order to be able to make a confident decision on how useful these body scanners are.
<D>
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, adding an institute of technology to stand with the existing universities sounds a good idea, but that is not what is on offer.
It is proposed to set up an institution with the Commission vetting the board, which then selects the knowledge and innovation centres with which it will at first work but which it will, in time, subsume unto itself.
It will even issue qualifications bearing the EU logo, with no reference to the universities of which it has made use.
Surely, this is about innovation, but you do not get that by wishing it.
Especially this one, by encroaching on universities, will stifle enterprise, not promote it.
If you want to encourage innovation, look to individuals coming through universities.
Look to individuals in the SMEs, and offer resources to help them develop and promote their ideas.
If you are suggesting a network to enhance and spread ideas, do not bother.
This Community already communicates across the world.
Good ideas soon become international.
For goodness' sake, drop this attempt to harmonise universities and consider the value of the varying contributions made by these different institutions.
If you have money to spare, use it to support innovators.
They work alone or in concert with small teams.
Europeans like Archimedes, Newton, Pasteur, Ehrlich, Röntgen, Fermi, Teller and Watson-Watt were brought on by no institute.
They just needed time and space to think and conduct research.
<D>
in writing. - (SV) The USA has had a trade embargo against Cuba for 48 years.
The embargo affects the Cuban population and is a constant and recurring excuse for the shortcomings of the Castro regime.
Everything is said to be the fault of the American embargo and, as a result, the people of Cuba cannot lay the blame clearly at the door of the Communist regime and distance themselves from it.
The democratic opposition in Cuba wants the embargo to be lifted.
On 29 October 2009, 187 of the UN member states voted to lift the embargo.
Three voted for it to remain in place and two abstained.
None of the EU Member States voted in favour of keeping the embargo.
In the past the European Parliament has condemned the embargo against Cuba and called for it to be ended immediately, in line with the demands made by the UN General Assembly on numerous occasions.
(P5_TA(2003)0374) The European Parliament has also stated that the embargo defeats its own object.
(P6_TA(2004)0061) The current resolution refers to the situation of political prisoners and prisoners of conscience in Cuba.
During the debate before the vote, I tabled a proposal that Cuba should be presented with an ultimatum.
The embargo will be lifted and within six months all prisoners of conscience must be released and reforms must be introduced.
If the regime does not comply with these terms, the USA, the EU and Canada will bring in new and more intelligent sanctions which are aimed at the Cuban leadership, such as a ban on travelling to the country and a freeze on Cuban assets and on foreign investment.
<D>
The ageing of the agricultural population, the abandonment of cultivated land and the constant reduction in the number of young people working in farming are recent developments that have occurred during the past 20 years.
Throughout these years the EU has failed to tackle the problems faced by small and medium-sized farmers, particularly young people.
The EU's measures are part of its anti-agricultural policy, which aims to reduce production and concentrate land in the hands of a few large-scale farmers.
This will result in the shrinkage of the agricultural population and the abandonment of the countryside, particularly by young people.
The report limits itself to findings.
The measures it puts forward are within the framework of this policy, so they hide the real reason behind the problems: the EU's confrontational policy.
This policy, together with the anti-farming CAP, aims to promote and increase the profits of the multinational monopolies and attack the incomes of small and medium-sized farmers.
The report actively supports the partial review carried out on the CAP in 2003, the proposed CAP 'health check' measures and the inclusion of the agricultural economy within the framework of the EU's anti-popular Lisbon Strategy.
Overturning the EU's anti-agricultural, anti-popular policy is the only solution that will enable farmers to remain on their land.
It will guarantee a decent income rather than further the aims and interests of the multinational monopolies.
<D>
Madam President, generally speaking, I could agree with those colleagues who commended the active role of the Czech presidency.
However, I cannot agree with the political tone expressed by the Deputy Prime Minister Mr Vondra in his introductory remarks.
His political tone is too calm.
Yes, we have spoken, and we speak, with one voice, but this voice is not strong enough.
Because, when we consider the plight of the millions of citizens in Europe suffering in this severe winter, we cannot be calm here.
I wonder why it is so.
We will have to act, and I agree with most of the colleagues who asked for an investigation, because we have to find out which of the two sides is more irresponsible.
Both are responsible!
Perhaps the reason for this calm political talk is the fact that now it concerns not only Russia but also Ukraine, and this is not correct.
I really think that not only this Parliament but also the presidency should raise its voice in the name of the citizens who are suffering.
<D>
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to make three points.
The first is a word of thanks to Mr Toubon and the way in which he has directed the whole process.
I think everyone on the right and the left of the House has actually been quite pleased with the way in which things have gone.
I think that the report is very good and balanced.
My second point is about selling the internal market.
I think that this paper tries to sell the internal market and we really need to do it.
Mr Goebbels, you referred earlier to the so-called 'Nordic model'.
Well, let me tell you that the Nordic model yes, on the one hand is about social welfare, but on the other hand it is also about economic openness.
These are the countries that are completely abiding by the rules of the single market - free movement of goods, free movement of services - with Polish plumbers! - free movement of money and free movement of people, with people coming in from other countries to work, so these are also open economies at the same time.
My argument is that we should not put down the single market because it is probably the best thing that we in the European Union have ever done.
Finally, I want to give you an example of how the single market does not work.
This is a real life example.
A Finnish Finnair captain bought a car in Italy, I shall not mention what kind of car, at the beginning of the summer.
Half an hour after he drove out of the shop he was stopped by the police.
They took away his interim licence plates which were legal, bought in Germany, and they confiscated the car and they will not give it back until they have gone through a legal process in December.
It could very well be that he loses his car, and here we are talking about an internal market where there should be full and free movement of goods.
So my point is that this report is great and it shows that we really have to keep on improving and working with the single market with a nice balance of free competition and social welfare.
<D>
I supported Mr Garriga Polledo's report because I found its general outlines justified in the light of the challenges that the European Union is to face over the coming years.
It is unrealistic to transfer new responsibilities to Europe without increasing the financial resources on which it can draw.
I would, however, have liked the European Parliament to move beyond the stage of legitimate demands and set a certain number of priorities.
The 'ever more' refrain of a number of my fellow Members is too glib a response.
What we need is to be convincing about the effectiveness of European expenditure compared with national expenditure.
Furthermore, the qualitative dimension of expenditure is at least as important as the quantitative one.
Finally, the transfer of funds unspent at European Union level to the EU budget rather than returning them to the Member States represents a source of considerable 'savings'.
As for introducing a system of own resources, I remain extremely hesitant about the unilateral introduction of a tax on financial transactions without a serious impact study.
Support for a measure of this nature without being aware of its implications shows that the majority of the European Parliament is on the wrong track.
<D>
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my group supports the own-initiative report by the Committee on Transport and Tourism with its multifaceted proposals for freight transport in Europe.
The framework conditions for environmentally friendly freight transport tailored to suit market needs are crucial for growth and employment in the European Union.
I must also say, however, that the European Union and the Member States are being called upon to increase their efforts considerably in developing and upgrading efficient transport structures.
We shall be reminding the Commission of this when we carry out the mid-term review of finances.
Making grand speeches does not help if the money is not made available to upgrade the trans-European networks.
Upgrading the transport infrastructures applies in particular to rail transport.
The priority here is to upgrade the most heavily used rail corridors and equip them with the ERTMS cross-border European rail traffic control system so that we quickly shift freight transport from road to rail.
However, to tell you the truth, Commissioner, when you compiled the list of proposals for freight services - I still remember that Neil Kinnock had already had the idea of separate rail networks for freight transport - you were once again acting on the Commission's proposal 'Towards a rail network giving priority to freight'.
Since that time nobody at the Commission has been talking about this because you and we know that there is not enough money to provide a second rail network alongside a normal, sensibly developed system tailored to suit market needs.
As the Commission you should therefore be telling the truth: the idea of separate freight networks is dead.
Let us develop sensible, dual-use networks: primarily passenger trains by day and primarily freight trains by night.
We then have to resolve the problem of noise because in cities in Germany and elsewhere, and along the Rhine, the noise at night really gets on citizens' nerves and stops them sleeping.
Therefore, let us talk about practical sound-proofing measures on the railways, on the trans-European networks and on the dual use of the rail network.
It is even more important, however, that we take sensible action on the logistics.
That, Mr Cramer, is mentioned all too little in the report.
It is important that the Member States and the EU work more effectively together with industry and the service enterprises in order to make better use of the freight logistics.
The use of logistics is, of course, a primary task of the enterprises.
They know best how logistics are used.
However, the European Union and the Member States can help by lifting unnecessary national restrictions and - this I fully concede to Mr Cramer - by providing standard customs documents, for example, in order that better use can be made of the logistics.
Let us therefore upgrade the infrastructure nationally and let us cooperate with the industry in determining the best use of transport logistics.
<D>
Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking the French Presidency for the opportunity that it gave us to see this package through to the end.
Special thanks go to Vice-President Tajani and to the Commission for its significant contribution in the final phase of the negotiations.
I also thank everyone for your comments and contributions.
I wish to give a special mention to all the rapporteurs, especially Mr Kohlíček, and, if you will permit me, also to the shadow rapporteur, Mrs Miguélez Ramos.
They ensured that disputes between Member States, such as occurred with the wreck of the Prestige, will not happen again and that everyone really recognises their responsibility when the worst happens.
I thank Mr Costa, with whom I worked throughout the process, especially on the report relating to the responsibilities of passenger carriers while I was rapporteur for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, for ensuring that all modes of maritime transport guarantee the protection of their passengers; that means of financially compensating passengers exist for when the worst happens; and that those who are potentially the worst affected are also the best protected, quickly and even in advance, regardless of where the blame lies.
Means of legal recourse exist that are sufficiently clear, accessible and based on information that is clear and available in advance.
As I have already said, the adoption of this third maritime safety package is a significant victory for the European legislative process.
The Commission, the Council and Parliament have accepted a text that improves everyone's lives, promotes better security on the seas, oceans and inland waters, and prepares our future.
By voting for this package tomorrow, we are paying tribute to the victims of all the past or recent maritime tragedies and we are honouring citizens and businesses.
I hope, Mr Vice-President, that the provisions to be adopted tomorrow in this package will be observed so that the citizens' expectations that have now been created can be transformed into a real strengthening of their safety and their rights.
<D>
in writing. - (DE) Instead of setting quotas, which can easily give rise to feelings of envy and resentment, it would be more appropriate to provide support for young women in their educational choices and career planning, in order to discourage the focus on women's professions.
If a woman chooses the security of working in a team or within the family instead of a lonely, stressful managerial role, we must accept this.
Equal pay for equal work is something which is long overdue.
If this is not implemented, then all attempts to provide paternity or parental leave will fail, on account of the financial realities.
Single parents are at particularly high risk of poverty and society needs to show more solidarity in this respect.
Another problem is that work done by women, such as housework, bringing up children or caring for relatives, is often not regarded as proper work.
We must bring about change in this area.
If we want family life to continue, we must introduce family-friendly working hours, but the EU is opposing this.
It is not enough to call for solidarity between the generations.
We must put it into practice.
Today's report appears to be a step in the right direction, which is why I have voted in favour of it.
<D>
(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, I think we have done a good piece of work here, and not only for the internal market, as Mr Schwab has just said, but also for citizens - and this is much more important to me, as we want to ensure that they find themselves in a Europe that is growing together, in a very positive sense, and I think that has indeed been happening here.
As coordinator, I am particularly obliged to our shadow rapporteur, Mr Hasse Ferreira, for the excellent work he has done together with the rapporteur and the other shadow rapporteurs.
The Socialist Group in the European Parliament would also have liked to see a greater extension of the scope - that goes without saying - but compromises sometimes cannot be helped.
I think we have nevertheless found a very good solution.
Facilitating the comparison of offers, the right of withdrawal and advertising will lead to better conditions for our citizens in future, so that they can be king in a market that used to be a real jungle.
This rank growth has meant that many people who maybe did not pay too much attention when it came to their holidays have ended up in a very difficult situation.
We want to prevent this happening in future, and I do believe that this compromise will make this possible.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I would like to thank you for a very lively and substantive debate on EU enlargement and our strategy - now, next year and in the near future.
This debate has been in line with the best democratic traditions of this Parliament, and I am grateful for the broad general endorsement of our carefully conducted enlargement policy.
You have rightly underlined the importance of simultaneous and parallel commitment and conditionality in EU enlargement.
I agree, and I want to underline the paramount importance of being both fair and firm at the same time.
We have to be fair and respect the commitments we have undertaken to the countries that are covered by our consolidated enlargement agenda in south-eastern Europe, that is, the western Balkans and Turkey.
At the same time, we can be as firm and as we are fair, and we need to apply rigorous conditionality when dealing with these candidate countries and potential candidates.
These only work together - in tandem, in unison - and that is, indeed, the best recipe for driving reforms and democratic and economic transformation in south-eastern Europe.
It is also the best recipe for anchoring stability in the western Balkans and driving reforms that enhance fundamental freedoms in Turkey.
I think Mrs Flautre is right that there cannot be, by definition, a more attractive portfolio than enlargement.
However, I am a man of moderation - believe it or not - and I believe that there are certain limits to how much attraction and fascination a man can take.
And, as Carl requested, some work will also be left for my successor, for the next Commission and for this Parliament.
Be that as it may, it has been great to work with you.
Together we have made a difference.
Let us recall that EU enlargement has greatly contributed to the fact that Europe today is whole and free.
Let us keep it that way, and let us complete our work in south-eastern Europe.
(Applause)
<D>
Each year in Europe, 180 000 migrant women suffer or are at risk from suffering genital mutilation.
It is important to remember that these mutilations constitute a violation of human rights that has very serious physical and psychological consequences.
These practices cannot be justified on the grounds of cultural or religious traditions.
In order to put a stop to them, the Member States must enforce compliance with the prohibition laid down in their criminal law, and the practice of mutilation must be considered a criminal offence.
At the same time, actual or potential victims must be given access to legal and medical assistance.
The EU must increase its support for those NGOs that are doing remarkable work on the ground in the areas of prevention and assistance.
At national and European levels, targeted information and education campaigns would remove the taboos associated with these practices whilst informing families of the criminal consequences of such mutilations.
It is therefore important for the EU to tackle this problem by defining joint preventive actions to prohibit the practice of mutilation in the EU and by referring to this prohibition in all cooperation agreements concluded with third countries.
Genital mutilation is a social problem that concerns us all.
<D>
(DE) Madam President, one of the accomplishments of the European Parliament that has attracted the most attention is the amendment of the 'Bolkestein Directive' by replacing the country of origin principle with the principle of freedom to provide services.
Employees need fair working conditions, and companies, especially SMEs, need protection from the cut-price competition threatening their survival.
Let us take care that the result is assured in the long term.
As this debate has just revealed, the recent judicial rulings in the Viking, Laval and Rüffert cases cast doubt on this.
Is it true that the European Court of Justice deems freedom to provide services more important than the protection of workers?
Does it consider the right to strike subordinate to the right to freedom of movement?
Whilst it is acceptable to question individual judgments, it is equally unacceptable to call into question the independence or legitimacy of the institution.
Obtaining clarification does not require modification of the Posting of Workers Directive but instead consistent implementation in the Member States.
This is the necessary balance between safeguarding freedom of movement and protecting workers.
The principle of 'equal pay for equal work in the same place' must not be weakened.
Working conditions exceeding the minimum level do not hinder competition, and collective bargaining must on no account be curtailed.
We need to say a clear 'no' to any kind of social dumping and a clear 'no' to attempts to create 'letterbox companies' intended to avoid minimum standards for pay and working conditions.
Social principles must not be subordinated to economic freedoms.
Only when there is fair play in the European Union can we obtain the urgently needed endorsement by companies and SMEs of the concept of the social market economy.
<D>
(FR) Mr President, yesterday, in this Parliament, I was questioned by a 16-year-old high-school student, who asked me, 'Is Europe prepared to make great sacrifices to save the planet?'.
This young student was very worried about climate change and was asking us how far we could go.
It was an expression of the distress felt by idealistic young people who expect a lot of us.
Well, we have market-based instruments that have been put in place: the Community system for the exchange of greenhouse gas emission quotas, and the 'Eurovignette' directive in the transport sector.
These instruments have certain advantages because they set a value on environmental costs and help towards the achievement of environmental targets, at a lower cost, and they encourage businesses to make a longer-term commitment, which ultimately sustains employment.
These instruments can help to reduce the damaging effects that environmental taxes could have on competitiveness in some sectors.
The promotion of sustainable development and the efforts to combat climate change should not be just a deterrent, through taxes and charges, but also an incentive, by facilitating a quicker transition to virtuous and eco-friendly behaviour.
Everyone has to make the effort; that is why environmental costs need to be internalised.
It must also be stressed that environmental taxes should not be regarded as a way of increasing tax revenue, but as a means of preventing all harmful pollution and damage to the environment, at a reasonable cost.
Finally, in future debates on the 'energy-climate' package in the European Parliament, we shall have to give serious consideration to putting in place a border adjustment instrument, which will in particular help avoid any carbon leaks.
We need to fulfil the obligation to reduce CO2 emissions, whilst preserving economic competitiveness.
In that connection, I emphasise the importance of the 'carbon' tax.
That is often a taboo subject, but I still think it is worthwhile and should be considered.
<D>
- (PL) Mr President, the Posting of Workers Directive is one of the foundations on which the practical implementation of one of the four basic Community freedoms, which are European freedoms, is based and which has accompanied treaties and the European Community right from the start.
Article 49 of the Treaty is one of the most clearly formulated regulations governing the internal affairs of the European Union, and it states unambiguously that restrictions on freedom to provide services within the Community shall be prohibited in respect of nationals of Member States who are established in a State of the Community other than that of the person for whom the services are intended.
The persistent practices found in many Member States aimed at administrative restriction of this freedom, which is guaranteed in the Treaty, are therefore surprising.
Since being elected to this Parliament, I have received a flow of complaints from businesspeople originating mainly from the new Member States that acceded to the EU after 2004, against the activities of local and regional authorities that wilfully impose on these businesspeople additional requirements that are not justified in the least by any EU legal act.
I have raised this issue on many occasions in this House, demanding an unambiguous statement from the European Commission on behalf of EU law, and consequently in defence of the freedom to provide services.
I am pleased that my efforts have received such a clear confirmation in the ruling of the European Court of Justice that we are discussing today.
I am convinced that in the light of recent Court verdicts we - that is, Parliament and the European Commission together - will be able to draw up a formula for the organisation of an internal services market that, while ensuring the fundamental rights of employees, ensuring those rights - those fundamental rights - will not impose extra burdens on EU businesspeople that will hamper their activities and that are by definition - as the Court's rulings state - in breach of European law.
A free market for services and employee mobility should be supported, not fought.
These are the challenges of the 21st century.
<D>
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I must firstly congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Parish, on the quality of his work and the importance that he placed on cooperation with the shadow rapporteurs.
Before we vote tomorrow at first reading, I want to go over the main lines of this report.
Nowadays, the negative image that animal experimentation can have among the general public confirms the indisputable importance of this issue.
Like me, you will have also received, over the last few weeks, a large number of letters from worried citizens.
However, while we have a duty to propose a text that takes account of the public's fears, we must not, for all that, neglect the demands of researchers.
I must underline the fact that we cannot forget that researchers are not only legitimate representatives of this public opinion, but primarily people whose role is absolutely fundamental within our society.
You must be aware that, in the last 20 years, the number of animals used for scientific purposes has not increased, despite the fact that the number of scientific publications in the area of biomedical research has doubled every two years.
In order to understand the challenges involved in revising this directive, I myself have met with many stakeholders representing the various opinions on this issue.
To my mind, the initial text proposed by the European Commission was really moving away from the fundamental aim in using animals, namely to make advances in research.
It was therefore essential to put the issue of human health back at the heart of the discussions.
Clearly, the provisions on animal experimentation must be amended, but European research must not, however, suffer negative consequences from this new legislation.
The strategy that I adopted, and which has been taken up by the rapporteur, therefore involved rebalancing this proposal to ensure that researchers are not harmed.
Based on the report adopted in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I believe that we can arrive at a coherent and reasonable text, which I hope will be broadly supported by Parliament.
<D>
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. - (SV) Mr President, trade in services has today become a necessity for all economies.
It is impossible for any country to achieve economic success with an expensive and ineffective service infrastructure.
Therefore I would like to express my great thanks to Mr Kamall for an excellent and important report.
Producers and exporters of textiles, tomatoes and other goods will not be competitive if they do not have access to an efficient banking system, efficient insurance companies, accountancy firms, telecommunications and transport systems.
The opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs emphasises that access to financial services such as micro credits, access to basic banking services and international bank transfers are necessary for individuals in developing countries to engage in basic economic activities and start companies.
The Committee also maintains that the particular nature of the financial sector demands considered solutions in a globalised world.
This is also something which Commissioner Mandelson himself was talking about.
If our partners in the negotiations, primarily the developing countries, say no to the opportunity of opening up the service markets, this will impair their chances of economic development.
To those of you here in this assembly with doubts, I say: look at how your own countries have developed!
Development of trade in goods has gone hand in hand with the development of trade in services.
To the advantage, Mr President, of all citizens!
<D>
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. - (EL) Mr President, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I should like to convey our opinion to you.
We endorse to a large extent the root cause of this Commission proposal, which is well structured and, of course, is designed to minimise administrative burdens.
We think that, alongside translation, the simplification of procedures and the recognition of translations by other certified translators from another Member State is absolutely justified and fully endorse this approach.
Now I come to the question of publication.
Our committee believes - as the Committee on Legal Affairs, in my opinion quite rightly, believes - that, in addition to companies, there are also citizens who also have the right to know.
Unfortunately, Commissioner, citizens do not have the same access to electronic media to which your initial proposal directed them.
We live in a pluralistic Europe, with different models and different values.
You, as a Commissioner from Ireland, know that the outcome of the referendum in your country, the perception of many of your fellow countryman about one model for all of Europe, cost us dearly.
We do not therefore want to introduce this model in Europe, knowing full well that in my country, in my region, access to the Internet is restricted.
Why should we therefore deprive these people, these European citizens, of the right to learn about things which concern them via other traditional channels?
I therefore consider, Commissioner, as do the Committee on Economic Affairs and the Committee on Legal Affairs, that the electronic platform must be compulsory and quite rightly so.
However, it must not be the only platform.
We must allow all European citizens to access information.
We do not want a situation in which someone in a region of Europe has to find out what is going to happen in his region on a BlackBerry, because where I live many people do not have a BlackBerry.
I therefore consider that, as the representative of the Commission, and I believe that we should send the Council the same message, you must take serious account of the position which we expressed unanimously in the Committee on Legal Affairs and by a large majority in the Committee on Economic Affairs.
May I say that, if you are thinking about ignoring it, I would advise you to think again, because it is only through productive democratic dialogue that we can find mutually acceptable solutions for the benefit of the many, not just the few.
<D>
The situation in Afghanistan is still a concern.
Almost 10 years after the Western coalition drove the Taliban from power, peace and prosperity are still far from being a daily reality for Afghans.
The strategy used for years in the country is flawed and must be changed.
The Union must assert its views on the subject and take note of the failure of the United States' military policy in the region.
Our troops are bogged down, and no hope of exit seems possible under such conditions.
For these reasons, I supported Parliament's resolution calling for a new strategy for Afghanistan.
The system that has been in place until now must be changed.
We have to tackle corruption and waste so that international aid can at last fulfil its role.
Peace will return through civil action.
The coalition needs to be stricter when controlling these funds.
On the other hand, we must stop interfering in Afghan affairs.
The Afghan Government must be free to find its modus vivendi with all the groups that make up Afghan society.
The path to development is still long, and we must not endanger these fragile balances.
<D>
(BG) Thank you, Mr President.
At the moment, citizens in 18 Member States are being held hostage in the political dispute between Ukraine and Russia.
I use the term 'political dispute' because we all witnessed how Gazprom and the energy supplies from Russia are being used as a political weapon to exert pressure on a sovereign state.
Europe's citizens are being held hostage.
The gas is supplied from Russia.
The valve has been turned off in Russia.
Yes, Ukraine does bear some guilt and so, I appeal to both the Council and the European Commission to tell our friends in Ukraine in no uncertain terms that unless both the opposition and government adopt a united stand on the key issues affecting their development, they will not be able to cope with this pressure which is being exerted on them and us respectively.
Just as we have a consensus in our countries on key issues, they too must have a consensus on key issues.
Secondly, Gazprom must pay our countries penalties because at the moment Bulgaria, which is the most seriously affected country in Europe and is totally dependent on the gas energy supplies in Russia, must claim its rights and must claim them against the supplier, which is Russia in this case.
Thirdly, when it comes to energy in Europe, the one and same message must be given.
We must clearly say 'yes' to nuclear energy in Europe, 'yes' to alternative energy sources, 'yes' to the different pipelines which make us less dependent on a single supplier, 'yes' to bigger storage facilities and 'yes' to more links between Member States so that we can avoid a similar type of crisis.
Last of all, I would like to say that in our case, the Bulgarian Government is also coming in for severe criticism.
During all the years it has been in power, the government has been concealing the supply agreements with Russia and has not been doing anything to diversify our country's supply sources.
<D>
(DA) Madam President, early tomorrow morning I am going to the grocer's to buy bottled drinking water.
In many countries people do this because the groundwater sources have been contaminated by pollution.
The water is subject to chemical treatment as if it were a dirty coat.
Then it is chlorinated and tastes as bad as it is expensive.
In Denmark we have a rich vein of gold underground: clean groundwater.
We drink it directly as drinking water without first sending it to a water treatment works.
It is healthier than bottled water, it tastes better and it is much, much cheaper.
However, this also means that we must watch over it and prohibit pesticide sprays in cases where the pesticide could enter the groundwater.
Therefore, Denmark prohibits 13 types of pesticide sprays, 12 of which are found in drinking water.
This is something that we would like to continue with and I therefore request that my fellow Members vote in favour of an amendment to permit protection zones.
We have already had the proposal adopted in previous regulations; these must now be repeated in order to prevent them from being annulled.
Finally, we have received support from a large majority here in Parliament and subsequently from the President of the Commission, José Manuel Barroso.
Thank you!
We have received no support from the Danish Commissioner for Agriculture, who, together with the Danish Minister for Food, Agriculture and Fisheries (also from the Danish Liberal Party (Venstre)), would rather support the farmers' opportunity to ruin our drinking water.
It is sad that the Danish Agricultural Council would rather support Venstre.
It is very short-sighted to pursue slightly higher corn yields and then have to pay billions of kroner in order to purify the groundwater.
The Treaty states that polluters themselves will pay.
I have proposed this in an amendment and I request that my fellow Members support the requirements of the Treaty.
No-one has the right to poison our common earth and drinking water.
<D>
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FR) Madam President, Commissioner, I also wish to thank our colleague Jan Mulder for his report today and for his methodology.
I am glad our Parliament is looking into the cross-compliance mechanisms for CAP aid, which have demonstrated since the major reform of 2003 the limitations of a system whose rules are often too finicky, and have transformed the job of farmers into a kind of ad hoc official within the European administration, when they are actually carrying out a mission essential to mankind: feeding us.
The 2003 reform is an unmistakable step forward which ought to help our agricultural sector protect the environment and health, and it was in this spirit in 2005 that we voted in favour of the new EAFRD Regulation replacing the EAGGF - Guarantee section.
I am taking part in the debate today as the permanent rapporteur on the Structural Funds for the Committee on Budgets in order to stress - like many of my colleagues - how important it is to reduce excess bureaucracy in managing these funds.
On the subject of the budget, I feel firstly that it is vital that all players in the agricultural economy and rural development, the main guarantors of environmental protection, reduce useless administrative burdens so that they can focus on their main activity, which is continuing to achieve the quality agriculture we expect, and environment-friendly agriculture at that.
Secondly, I would also like the controls to focus on two matters which are extremely useful in guaranteeing a suitable cost-profit ratio.
I feel it is vital that the rules we make do not hinder use of the available credits for which we fight so fiercely at each round of negotiations with the Member States in the Council.
It is not normal to see such under-use of appropriations at the end of 2007.
I thus intend to vote for all these measures to the extent that they endeavour to reduce the administrative burden.
<D>
I agree with a common visa policy that facilitates legitimate travel and implements measures aimed at facilitating the process of lodging and processing visa applications (reduced costs, simplified issue procedure, use of visas for multiple entries, longer periods of validity).
It is also a matter of urgency that illegal immigration be tackled through further harmonisation of national legislation and handling practices at local consular missions.
I acknowledge the urgent need to reinforce the coherence of the common visa policy, particularly by incorporating into one code on visas all provisions governing the issuance of visas and decisions in relation to refusal, extension, annulment, revocation and shortening of visas issued.
I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Lax, on the excellent compromise that he has managed to achieve, but regret that the weak compromise achieved in the report on Common Consular Instructions (which must be inserted in this proposal) will end up being to the detriment of this proposal.
An example of this is the exemption from and reduction in cost of visas for children, which was agreed in this House, but which will end up not producing the expected effects due to the additional charges to be levied where the service is provided by external companies.
For all these reasons, which led me to vote against that report, I cannot fully support this report, which is why I have abstained.
<D>
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets. - (FR) Madam President, Mrs Hübner, today we are looking at five very important documents on cohesion policy, which, I would remind you, has for some months now been the main item in our budget.
In this way we are of course already sending a strong signal to the future renewed institutions: to Parliament, naturally, but also to the Commission.
It goes without saying that cohesion tools, and above all the funds, must represent real European added value for our fellow citizens, but today, in the context of the severe crisis hitting Europe, they must be more responsive and more adapted to urban situations in particular.
I especially welcome the work that has been done on the plan for housing assistance, since housing is the second priority for citizens, after jobs.
In fact, it is not always a question of money, as the funds are there, but of what I might call a 'structural' slow pace - sometimes in State management, sometimes in administrative inertia and sometimes, unfortunately, in both - which gets in the way of that impact we are always talking about, which is essential for our regions and our citizens.
At its worst, this could even appear counterproductive.
As permanent rapporteur for the Structural Funds within the Committee on Budgets, I would insist now more than ever, in the current crisis, that we should simplify, clarify and give genuine political substance to this European money.
<D>
Mr President, I would like to start by emphasising how pleased I am that we are able to sign the telecoms package together today.
The package strengthens competition and the protection of consumers in Europe.
We will have modern and up-to-date regulations in an area where development is very rapid.
I would also like to take the opportunity to thank all of those involved for their incredibly solid and constructive work and very creative cooperation.
I would like to extend a special thank you to the European Parliament's Vice-President, Alejo Vidal-Quadras, the Committee Chairman, Herbert Reul, and the three rapporteurs from Parliament, Catherine Trautmann, Pilar del Castillo Vera and Malcolm Harbour, who, like my colleagues in the Council, have done some extremely important work to enable us to put the telecoms package together.
This cooperation meant that we succeeded in reaching an agreement that clearly indicates the major and crucial importance of the internet for the freedom of expression and the freedom of information, and in so doing, we have not contravened the treaty.
The telecoms package is a major victory for all consumers in Europe.
Once again, I would like to thank everyone for the work that has been put in to achieve this agreement.
<D>
in writing.
(PL) We have adopted an important report on the demographic future of Europe.
Enabling citizens to live longer certainly represents an achievement for the Member States of the Union.
It also leads, however, to the gradual ageing of the population.
In the long term, this situation can only upset the balance between the productive population and those who are past that stage.
It is a threat to solidarity between the generations, because a smaller number of professionally active people than at present will have to bear the ever-increasing cost of benefits, allowances, pensions, care and health services for those who are not in work.
Action to lengthen the period of professional activity and increase the birth rate is called for in order to counter such a situation.
Programmes for the full integration of immigrants are also required.
Technical modernisation and the introduction of information technology into the workplace will ensure that work is more effective and productive.
This will make a significant contribution to improving the situation.
Consideration should also be given to the migratory flows from rural to urban areas, and to the hidden human capital in rural areas, notably in the less developed countries.
Demography is one of the key challenges for the European Union, especially in the context of significant overpopulation in other parts of the world.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - I have been asked by Mr Almunia to answer this question.
In order to ensure continuity of the regional development effort, the Commission decided in 2006 that the list of regions designated by Member States as part of the regional aid maps should apply through the whole period 2007 to 2013.
However, the Commission recognised in its guidelines for national regional aid that situations might arise where adjustments are necessary and, in accordance with point 104 of the guidelines, Member States were therefore offered the possibility to proceed to a mid-term review of the regional aid maps regarding regions designated under Article 107(3)(c) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.
Three out of seventeen Member States concerned by the mid-term review have decided to use this possibility.
Under the mid-term review, Member States can replace up to half of the regions at present eligible for regional aid by newly designated regions.
Under certain conditions, it is also possible to increase the aid intensities for regions already designated under the original regional aid map.
As part of the mid-term review, the eligibility of the newly designated regions, and of the possible increases in aid intensities, is assessed on the basis of the average of the most recent years of the Eurostat data as regards gross domestic product per capita and unemployment at the relevant NUTS level 3 region.
This helps to ensure regional investment aid is targeted towards the economic development of regions which are disadvantaged in relation to the national average.
The fact that only three of the Member States concerned by the mid-term review have decided to notify amendments to the regional aid maps seems to suggest that the majority of the Member States consider that the economic crisis has not substantially affected the set of regions in need of development aid.
<D>
Vice-President of the Commission. - (DE) Mr President, honourable Members, indeed, the debate has confirmed the broad consensus on the Variations Regulation, and so I shall not discuss it further.
We should now bring this into force as it stands and make sure that we do so as effectively as possible.
I think that, beyond this, what are more important overall are the other issues that have been raised here.
Allow me to make a couple of very fundamental points.
It is not my job, of course, to explain technical rules to you, but to tell you why we do certain things and why we do not do certain things.
There is a conflict in our societies between the requirements of the health care bureaucracy, on the one hand, and those of patients on the other.
This is absolutely clear.
The proposals that will be occupying our attention in future lie at the centre of this conflict area.
The health bureaucracies in the Member States are not interested in informed patients.
Informed patients mean more work, more effort.
Those who should be there for them are forced to give them information, answering questions such as: why am I being given this medicine, why am I not being given that medicine?
Why should I be given this treatment and why am I not being given that treatment?
They are entitled to know this as human beings.
An unwavering principle for me is the following.
In a democratic society, it should not be the case that those wishing to provide information must justify themselves, but that those not wishing to provide information do not have to.
It is the health care bureaucrats in the Member States who must explain why they do not want to see informed patients.
I do not have to explain why I do want to see informed patients.
To be perfectly clear, there will be a heated, lively, controversial debate here, and it is my hope and wish that the European Parliament will support the Commission and me in this debate.
After all, this issue is quite fundamental, and concerns not only public health but also social policy.
It is a question of what the freedom of citizens in health care, too, means to us.
On the second issue, with regard to counterfeiting, I agree with all those who have said that this is a criminal matter.
Counterfeiting in the illegal distribution chain is a matter for the police.
Illegal is illegal - we cannot do much more than that.
I do think, however, that the proposals we can make will ultimately make it virtually impossible to introduce counterfeit medicines into the legal distribution chain.
That is what we can do.
Mrs Roth-Behrendt is absolutely right.
In my opinion, it really is an impertinence to suppose that, in reality, this is about placing obstacles in the way of any forms of distribution of pharmaceutical products for competitive reasons.
I could not care less about that.
Parallel trade is a legal activity within the European Union.
This has been confirmed unequivocally by the European Court of Justice.
I am absolutely not thinking of getting my hands on parallel trade, but one thing I would say is that all parties involved in the distribution of medicinal products must be subject to the same strict safety requirements.
I fail to see why someone should be exempted from safety requirements just because they buy cheaply in one Member State a medicinal product that is sold for a higher price in another Member State, bring it back into the more expensive country, and resell it for a high price there.
I do not understand this.
Those of you with some knowledge of food law will have already been asking themselves, as I did, why it is most strictly forbidden in Europe to open a pack of spaghetti on the way from the manufacturer to the consumer - this is indeed most strictly forbidden - yet it is permitted to open on the way from the manufacturer to the consumer medicinal products which, when taken wrongly, can result in death.
It is worth reflecting on why this astounding disparity exists, why it is forbidden in the case of spaghetti, for example, but permitted in the case of vital medicinal products.
I find this difficult to understand.
We shall find solutions that make it possible for all parties to continue their business, precisely in the spirit of what Mrs Roth-Behrendt said: we must apply a little creativity, use our brains and give it some thought, but the safety requirements apply in full to all: there can be no exceptions!
I believe I have answered your questions and also given you a foretaste of the coming lively debate.
The proposals will be presented in a few weeks' time, and all I can say in this regard is that we shall meet again in this Chamber and we shall have to discuss this matter further.
<D>
(NL) I should like to join previous speakers, including the Commissioner and the President-in-Office of the Council, in expressing the concern we all share about the situation that has arisen in the region - specifically the Caucasus - regarding Georgia and the problems with South Ossetia and Abkhazia.
Whereas until recently we were talking of frozen conflicts, the situation is now such that these risk becoming dormant conflicts; and we must of course all take care that they do not become open conflicts.
The European Union, the UN and everyone capable of playing a role has a responsibility to defuse the situation.
We must of course reject the moves that have been made by Russia.
These are - or at least appear to be - moves towards formalisation, towards a possible recognition of independence.
Geostrategic interests play a major role in this regard, of course.
I can imagine that there is frustration in Moscow about the recent NATO Summit, which agreed to allow Georgia to join NATO in the longer term, and that there is naturally also the requisite annoyance about the reaction of most EU countries to Kosovo's declaration of independence.
We think that such matters must be kept strictly separate from the situation in Georgia.
In the past, agreements have been made on this in the OSCE, and we think that the UN, in particular, must endeavour to put the matter, the consultations and dialogue, back on the rails.
Now we are actually seeing a kind of escalation on both sides, an escalation in the war of words; a chess game, indeed, as the Commissioner says, but one that I fear will be without winners - which is no good to anyone.
On the one hand, there is the reaction of Russia, which is increasing the number of 'peacekeepers'.
On the other hand, Georgia is creating problems in the WTO negotiations on Russia's membership.
I believe that the nationalistic undertone discernible on both sides must be eliminated from the discussion.
All parties should show restraint, as many have said, and in the longer term there must of course be endeavours towards a structural solution.
I believe that the European Union can play an important role in this regard, including in direct dialogue with Russia during the forthcoming EU-Russia Summit.
This may present an opportunity to question the new president on what his country plans to do about these frozen conflicts, not only in the Caucasus but also in Transnistria; perhaps there the new president can indicate his intentions with regard to the agreements that were made in the OSCE back in 1999, I believe, regarding the situation in these breakaway countries, republics, states and so on.
Finally - and I agree with everyone who has criticised Russia's interpretation of UN decisions - these 'peacekeepers' are not peacekeepers, of course; they should rather be seen as troops serving a Russian strategic military interest and certainly not UN objectives.
New agreements must be made in this regard, and the European Union may be able to play a role in these.
In addition, of course, Georgia's territorial integrity must be preserved, as must its respect for minorities and their problems - Mr Swoboda has said a few things about this - since the people on the ground risk being crushed between Moscow and Tbilisi.
It is of course important that something be done to tackle the refugee problem.
Perhaps the best way for the European Union to help is for it to invest in confidence-building measures to help both sides on the road to renewed dialogue.
<D>
The revision of the 2006 Energy Efficiency Action Plan is an increasingly urgent task since, in connection with the EU's 20-20-20 targets, the lack of progress is most evident in the area of energy efficiency targets.
Many initiatives already point in the right direction, but the present achievements are still dwarfed by the range of unexploited possibilities.
Europe has just begun to recognise its lack of progress, and has realised that it cannot afford the luxury of taking the development of energy efficiency lightly.
Such investments can reduce emissions more cheaply than any other solutions, and can immediately invigorate the economy.
One sign of a positive turning point is that on the basis of the European Parliament's decision, even the hitherto unused resources of the Economic Recovery Programme can be used for energy efficiency developments and green investments.
The Energy 2020 strategy published by the European Commission in November also ranks energy efficiency as the highest priority.
Now it is the Bendtsen report that formulates specific recommendations as to how we could exploit our possibilities more effectively.
I am glad that innovative solutions such as smart grids and ESCOs that implement investments producing a return on energy efficiency have also been included in the report.
However, financing still remains the most important issue.
Energy efficiency aids must be included in future long-term EU budgets as well, having particular regard to the building reconstruction programmes of the former socialist countries.
This is the area where impressive savings can be realised with relatively small outlay.
<D>
in writing. - (IT) Committee on Legal Affairs.
Thank you, Madam President.
I am voting for the Frassoni report, which reminds us of the fundamental role that the European Parliament, national parliaments and national courts must play in the application of Community law.
I agree that we must remind the Commission of the possibility of having a system that clearly indicates the various means of recourse available to citizens.
This system could take the form of a joint EU portal, or of a single online contact point providing assistance to citizens.
Citizens should have the same level of transparency, whether they are submitting a formal complaint or exercising their right to submit a petition, on the basis of the Treaty; clear information should therefore be made available to the Committee on Petitions on the state of progress of infringement proceedings which are also relevant to pending petitions.
Signatories must be kept fully informed of the state of progress of their complaints, at the expiry of each predetermined deadline.
Summaries should be be prepared and made available to the public via a single access point.
Furthermore, these summaries ought not to disappear once the legislative procedure has been completed, at the very moment when they assume greater importance for the public and businesses.
<D>
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I also think that we need to have a transnational police force that can specifically tackle international crime, which today is no longer confined within national borders.
Only a few days ago the Italian Parliament's anti-Mafia commission went to Germany, where it found that an enormous amount of the financial resources invested in Germany have been obtained through a mechanism that directly involves Sicilian and Calabrian criminals.
I believe that this is emblematic of the real need to combat crime on an international basis, and one way to do so is by putting in place European police resources.
I believe that Europol can accomplish this job, but I have some doubts about whether transforming Europol into an agency can immediately salvage it.
We have a duty to evaluate Europol's activities from 1994 to today, and I believe that we will probably also need to review its specific mission, because I think that its priorities ought to be tackling drug trafficking, money-laundering and transnational Mafia organisations.
I believe that there are also still some problems regarding the need to fully recognise Parliament's powers.
Parliament should have supervisory powers - this is the case for all national parliaments, which have supervisory powers over the national police - and I believe that the European Parliament should have supervisory powers over a European agency whose key tasks are policing and combating international crime.
I also believe that we need to have some clarifications on data protection.
I am extremely worried because the proposal, as it has been adopted and probably will be adopted in the future by the Council, has serious deficiencies which put the individual data of European citizens at serious risk.
<D>
(NL) Mr President, Commissioner, logistics processes are a matter chiefly for industry and the transport sector and in my view that is how it should stay.
They are considerations featuring prominently on the agenda in Europe and indeed worldwide and for that reason we welcome the Commission's proposal.
But efforts need to be concentrated on securing a better framework for transport and fewer obstacles rather than on yet more European rules or prohibitions.
The rules do need to be tidied up.
So I am happy that in this regard we have significantly streamlined the rapporteur's draft report.
Let me say a little more about the obstacles to logistics.
Last year in this House we debated the Naiades report.
We are fully behind the Commission on this, because there are a lot of obstacles to inland waterway transport too, and I hope the Commission will lose no time in laying its first proposals before Parliament.
Another obstacle to logistics is the restriction on these 60-tonne vehicles.
I support the compromise, namely that Member States must be able to decide whether or not they apply this, but I am also aware that there are an awful lot of myths, not to say mega-myths, doing the rounds on this subject.
You are having a study conducted, Commissioner.
I urge you above all to study the facts and I also urge you to study the international routes.
I agree with my fellow Member Mr Jarzembowski that we must not allow these gigaliners into our towns and villages.
But over long-haul routes where there is no alternative, fine.
So will you look at the facts?
I await your conclusions with interest.

rapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Ulmer, I have of course taken note of the concern you expressed about the possible mixing of Category 1 and 2 materials and we also consulted the industry regarding this problem at the end of the negotiations.
I think that one would already need to act extremely illegally in order to be able to mix in this material.
We will check whether a more stringent regulation is needed here.
What we wanted to achieve with this new regulation was to enable the by-products of slaughter to be used in many ways and in that regard I can also say to Mrs Doyle that your concern is unfounded.
Everything is the same as before.
By establishing the end point for slaughter by-products, we have also very clearly stipulated that they will then become subject to totally different provisions, in other words we have clearly indicated the transfer to the Waste Framework Directive.
I believe that we are on the right path here.
I would also like to mention that we naturally also want to address the issue of the rotten meat scandals with this new regulation.
We are not completely on the right path yet in this regard, but with the labelling and the guaranteed traceability, I believe that we are heading in the right direction.
Of course, we now need to see what sort of labelling the Commission will propose.
This will not be particularly easy, as we all know the problem of the blue Chappi dog food - no one wants that.
In this respect, we definitely need our researchers to choose an approach.
As regards the issue of organic fertilisers, which was also up for debate and has not yet been properly discussed, the Commission actually intended to provide for more thorough mixing-in of the material so that the animals did not even notice it.
However, that would result in a change to the quality of the fertiliser and I believe that we have formulated a good regulation in this regard and that our small-scale gardeners who like organic fertilisers so much can also be appropriately provided for.
By and large, then, this is a good regulation.
I am very happy with it and with the cooperation, and I hope that we will not have to amend it again too soon.
The cooperation with the Commission was very agreeable and for that I am very grateful.

Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make a statement on the occasion of the fifth European Day for the Victims of Terrorism.
It is a day which must remain in our memory and a day on which we commemorate all the innocent victims of terrorism.
This weekend, two soldiers in the county of Antrim in Northern Ireland were murdered by the Real IRA and on Monday, a policeman was shot in the county of Armagh.
The policeman who was killed was married and had children.
This barbaric act of terrorism has once again torn a family apart and brought with it unimaginable suffering.
Yesterday, at least ten people died in a suicide bomb attack in southern Sri Lanka and more than twenty were seriously injured.
On behalf of the European Parliament, I would like to express my outrage at these abhorrent attacks on innocent people and send my deepest condolences to the families of the victims.
They will forever remain in our memories.
Today, we in the European Parliament would like to speak out loudly and clearly against the indiscriminate violence of terrorism.
We condemn utterly the senseless destruction of human life, the deaths of entire families as a result of blind fanaticism, which causes people to kill their fellow human beings and to trample human dignity underfoot.
Terrorism is a direct attack on freedom, human rights and democracy.
Terrorism is an attempt to destroy by means of indiscriminate violence the values which unite us in the European Union and within our Member States.
These acts of terrorism shock us all.
They cause us deep and heartrending pain, but they cannot and will not destroy the foundations of the democratic society which is based on our shared values.
Terrorism is a crime which deserves no leniency.
Terrorism represents one of the greatest dangers to the security, stability and democratic values of the international community.
It is a direct attack on our citizens, on all of us.
The European Parliament plays an active role in combating terrorism and in supporting the victims of terrorist attacks.
We cannot repeat often enough that there is no justification for terrorism.
For this reason, we must continue to work together to fight terrorism by applying the principles of the rule of law and using all the force of the law.
Today in the European Parliament, all our thoughts are with the victims of terrorism, wherever in the world they died.
We would like to express our solidarity with them.
I would like to ask you to remember in silence the victims of the Real IRA and of the suicide bomb attack in Sri Lanka.
(The House rose and observed a minute's silence)
Ladies and gentlemen, the great European, Jean Monnet, one of the founding fathers of European integration, died thirty years ago on 16 March 1979.
On the occasion of the 30th anniversary of his death, I would like briefly to honour and recognise his legacy and his life's work in the cause of European integration at the start of this plenary sitting of the European Parliament.
Today we remember the priceless legacy of a man, who, together with Robert Schuman, one of the architects of the reconciliation between Germany and France, took the first step towards establishing a community with a common destiny based on peace, understanding, democracy and cooperation among the people of Europe.
Now, at the beginning of the 21st century, the principles highlighted by Jean Monnet and the methods he used to implement them have lost none of their relevance.
On the contrary, their importance is obvious to us all.
The major challenges presented by globalisation, the economic and financial crisis and global warming will cause Europeans to work even more closely together to provide an effective defence for our shared values and our interests in the world.
Jean Monnet would, of course, welcome the progress made in the Treaty of Lisbon towards a democratic European Union which is capable of action and of facing the challenges of the 21st century.
And finally, it is important to mention that it was the Action Committee for a United States of Europe established by Jean Monnet which, among other things, proposed direct elections to the European Parliament.
In the last thirty years since the death of Jean Monnet, this dream has become an impressive reality with the creation of the parliamentary dimension of the European Union.
We are all the heirs of this great European, Jean Monnet, and his work continues to have a lasting impact.
It has resulted in fundamental changes to the relationships between the European states and still influences the lives of all of our citizens today.
On the occasion of the 30th anniversary of Jean Monnet's death, I would like us to think about the task ahead of us and our obligations for the future, which are to commit to continuing the great work started by Jean Monnet of unifying our continent.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I think it has been shown very clearly that we all feel that what has happened is very difficult to understand.
It is very serious.
We are all concerned, because the imposition of emergency rule has greatly endangered the strengthening of democratic institutions and the building of a more inclusive democratic process.
It is therefore of fundamental importance that civil and political rights are fully restored, media restrictions withdrawn and essential improvements made to the framework and conditions for elections.
Stability and development can only be achieved with democracy and the rule of law.
We therefore have to reflect further on the question of a possible election observation mission.
As I said, we might be able to send a smaller team of advisers to follow the process under the current circumstances.
If not, as I said, the state of emergency would have to be lifted very quickly and civil liberties restored.
With regard to aid, let me say that we had already substantially increased our aid to Pakistan, particularly in the fields of education and rural development.
Therefore, as I said before, I think at this stage we must sit back, wait for a moment, and judge very carefully.
Of course we should not endanger the poor people in Pakistan, but we have to go about things in the right way.
<D>
(FR) Madam President, however much friendship we feel for the rapporteurs, Mr Vatanen and Mr von Wogau, we are unable to approve their reports.
Firstly, because NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, was created in 1949 in response to the terrible threat posed by communism towards Western Europe.
It played a useful, even essential role.
Today, however, this dreadful communist system has collapsed and the Warsaw Pact has been dissolved.
NATO, however, is constantly expanding.
Its activities extend beyond its geographical framework.
Afghanistan, as far as I am aware, does not have a North Atlantic coastline.
Neither does Kosovo, where it contributed to the ethnic cleansing of the Serbs in an unjust war that solved nothing.
NATO is thus violating the United Nations Charter.
Ladies and gentlemen, you are completely inconsistent.
You wish to create a strong, independent Europe and you absorb European defence into a US-dominated command system.
How can Russia and other nations fail to see in all that anything but an aggressive attitude?
NATO has subjugated us to the policy of the United States of America.
We are their friends, but we do not wish to be their vassals and still less their lackeys.
We have to put an end to this and get out of it.
NATO has had its time.
<D>
President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Mr President, I would like to thank Members for this exciting debate.
We could stay here for hours, as the subject is certainly worthy of a great deal of discussion and the thoughts they have shared have been fascinating.
Unfortunately, however, our time is limited.
I shall draw the following conclusions.
Firstly, as regards the laissez-faire approach and the lack of regulation, bearing in mind the reserve that comes with my job, I think I have expressed myself quite clearly.
It is my opinion that we must move beyond the regulation/no regulation debate.
Financial deregulation is now an outdated notion.
Strong, modern financial regulation will be the solution from now on.
It must be adapted; we must go beyond what has been done so far.
This is the first point I wish to make and, on this, I am extremely clear.
I also listened carefully to what Mrs Koch-Mehrin was saying and I repeat what she said, namely that regulation is not the enemy of the market.
Everyone must face up to their responsibilities.
It is the job of the public authorities to regulate and to adapt the rules in force, because the stability of the system, the protection of individual savers and the protection of depositors are at stake.
I would also say to Mr Wurtz: it is also employment and growth, which have a direct impact on the real economy, that are threatened by this crisis.
That is why we must act, including for the least wealthy, and quickly.
My second belief is that Europe must act within a framework of enhanced international cooperation.
There is no alternative.
As has been said, Europe must make its voice heard, otherwise we will be subjected to the effects of US solutions.
It has already happened with Sarbanes-Oxley.
We saw the consequences that had for some European companies; we saw the effect it had on accounting and market standards.
We can begin as of now.
The only advantage we have is that, today, Europe can, as Mr Almunia and President Sarkozy have both stressed, assert itself firmly, make its voice heard on the international stage, take the reins and get a head start.
I call on Europeans to coordinate themselves so that the Union has a strong presence on the international stage, and to reflect upon international financial structures and on international regulatory authorities.
Because if no international measures are adopted, we cannot complain about having no alternative but to draw on sovereign funds, which, moreover, we wish to keep.
I am not passing judgment, but there needs to be a certain consistency in this respect.
We need to know what we want to do and that if Europe fails to act, we will have to rely on other funds to stabilise the financial system.
My third belief is one that has been mentioned by several speakers, including Mr Schulz.
It is true that we must address the issue of salaries and the problem of profits linked to cyclical market activities.
The issue of market operators' salaries should also be seen in the context of this international reflection.
I am not the first to say so.
Gordon Brown has also said so in the past.
It seems logical to me, and in-depth thought must be given to this issue.
It is clear that this is not just an economic and financial crisis, but also one of ethics and responsibility.
It is a crisis of economic ethics and concerns all actors and political leaders, whatever their leanings.
As Mr Wurtz and other speakers have stressed, finance must continue to serve the economy; the economy must not be the victim of finance.
As I have said, thought must be given to the role of financial institutions and to the roadmap concluded by the Finance Ministers on the basis of Commission proposals.
Let us talk about specific progress.
To Mrs Berès, I say that we must go further and, with regard to the timetable, act quickly.
I repeat what Mr Almunia said: the Commission must act quickly because it is a question of restoring confidence, and I wish to conclude on this point.
Even if Europe is less affected, it is still important for us to send out messages of confidence.
This means action, international cooperation, not being afraid to adapt rules, acting quickly and having proposals on the table ready for the European Council on 15 October, applying the suggestions made by Parliament and, as has been said, being aware of the fact that we are dealing with transactions that affect not only the liquidity but also the solvency of the entire financial system.
It is now economic confidence that will kickstart growth and that is why we must cast aside dogmatism to take firm action and use the full range of tools at our disposal.

(RO) The European nationality offers a series of rights and freedoms on the entire EU territory.
For this reason, by signing the Treaty establishing the European Community, the Member States undertook the obligation to prohibit any discrimination.
Nevertheless, a few days ago, I was informed about the case of a Romanian citizen who was not allowed to rent a car in Brussels for the reason of having Romanian nationality.
The employee's refusal was merely based on an internal rule of the given car rental office.
In recent days, I have found out from various citizens of my country of many other cases of discrimination on the criterion of Romanian nationality.
Dear colleagues, it is our duty, as representatives of over 490,000,000 Europeans, to raise an alarm.
Through an active dialogue with our fellow citizens, we can contribute so that such incidents would be avoided in the future.
I consider it to be the European Union's duty, as a democratic entity, to promote respect for the rights of all the Union's citizens by initiating European programmes of education and information against discrimination.
I also request the European Commission to verify whether the Member States comply with the obligations they undertook via treaties, regarding discrimination based on nationality.
<D>
(DE) Madam President, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, may I voice my praise and respect for this report.
It is balanced and fair, and that is a line which we should keep to today.
We are right to emphasise that Turkey has to make further efforts.
The goal of achieving a stable and prosperous democracy in Turkey is not only in Turkey's own interests, but is also an important strategic interest of the EU.
I am concerned about the attitude of the incoming Council President, Mr Sarkozy.
His policy on Turkey does not aim to achieve EU accession for Turkey.
He is insisting on references to Turkey as an accession candidate being deleted from EU documents, and emphasises that France will only endorse the opening of chapters which do not aim at full membership.
The EU's credibility is at stake here.
Let me underline one point: pacta sunt servanda!
The opening of accession negotiations was agreed unanimously, and that means that France agreed to it as well.
Instead of sending out negative signals, the EU should deal constructively with Turkey.
In this House, we have decided by a majority that, with Turkey, we ...

<D>
in writing. - (DE) I am voting in favour of the report by Kartika Tamara Liotard on greater safety for novel foods.
We need stricter requirements for approving novel foods, such as products from cloned meat and the use of nanotechnologies.
The term 'novel foods' now includes numerous foods manufactured using novel methods which are currently only marginally represented on the European market, if at all, as well as foods simply unknown to European consumers.
However, they also include products from cloned animals, the long-term consequences of which have barely been researched at present.
Over 100 applications for approvals of novel foods have been made since 1997 and over 20 have been approved.
I am in favour of a separate regulation for products made from cloned meat and for new approvals to be suspended until such time as it enters into force.
Foods containing nanomaterials should be banned until such time as an animal-friendly and safe method of evaluation is found.
If such products are placed on the market, they must be labelled so that all information on their origin is directly brought to the consumer's attention.
<D>
President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, I apologise for being a bit late due to a meeting of the Conference of Committee Chairs here.
In fact I arrived only this morning from Washington.
I would like to thank you for your invitation to participate in this important and timely debate on transatlantic relations and to thank in particular the rapporteur, Mr Millán Mon, for the valuable and wide-ranging report that I read during my trip with great interest.
There is much in the report with which the Presidency, and the Council, can agree.
Whatever our political background, we all know that the transatlantic relationship is vital to our future, to the future of Europe.
For six decades, the solid transatlantic partnership has been the leading force for peace, stability and prosperity for Europe and North America, and for the entire world.
I claim that this is not just history.
This is the best possible agenda for the 21st century, too.
The transatlantic relationship allows us to achieve together results which neither partner alone can deliver.
I would quote here Vice-President Joe Biden during his first trip to Munich, when he clearly said that America needs Europe and Europe needs America.
I think that we can fully understand this kind of statement.
When we agree, we can set the terms of the global agenda.
When we disagree, it is difficult to take forward any agenda, so the transatlantic relationship allows us to achieve together results which we cannot achieve alone.
Last November's US Presidential election generated an unprecedented degree of enthusiasm, expectation and interest here in Europe.
This is because the choice of US President matters to Europeans.
President Obama has indicated a new approach to the challenges we face.
Many in Europe were attracted to this change and the spirit of change.
High expectations were created on both sides of the Atlantic.
These expectations represent an opportunity for our mutual cooperation at times when we most need it.
But they need to be carefully managed because nothing would be more damaging for our relationship than unfulfilled hopes - and the higher the hopes are, the harder it is to satisfy them.
The new Administration has made an energetic start.
As expected, much of the President's agenda has focused on the economic and financial crisis.
It was encouraging to see early decisions on Guantánamo - we were talking about that here just a few weeks ago - a renewed commitment to engage on the Middle East, and the convening of the conference on Afghanistan, which will be held on 31 May in The Hague.
All these initiatives are what many in Europe have been calling for.
The dialogue with the US has been reinvigorated.
From my contacts with the new Administration, including the meetings with Vice-President Biden and Secretary of State Clinton here in Brussels, it is clear that the US wishes to set a new tone with the EU and our partners.
I welcome the pragmatic approach which has characterised these early contacts.
While the change of tone is important, it does not of course in itself deliver concrete outcomes.
If we are to work constructively together we must review together our policy priorities, and reassess the way in which the transatlantic partnership functions.
Your report is a valuable contribution to that process.
It is, of course, a process which began on the EU side last year when the foreign ministers discussed transatlantic relations at the two informal meetings in Avignon and Marseille.
I think some thanks are due here both to the French Presidency for initiating that and to Portugal, which also played a role.
It is a process which will need to continue to be developed over the coming months.
An excellent opportunity will present itself next week at the informal meeting of heads of state and government with the US President in Prague.
The transatlantic relationship is rich and varied and includes a number of policy areas.
I cannot touch on all of them but I would like to highlight those that we would like to address in particular at the forthcoming meeting in Prague.
Firstly, energy security and climate change.
These interconnected topics are of concern to a great many Europeans.
Energy security is a key priority which needs to be pursued via a comprehensive strategy covering energy efficiency and the promotion of renewable energy resources as well as the diversification of energy supplies, sources and routes.
Wherever possible and necessary the EU and US should cooperate in these areas and promote a common agenda.
On climate, this year will be critical.
The United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen in late December presents a historic opportunity to revise and widen the application of binding international targets to address climate change.
The EU has established ambitious energy and climate change commitments in advance of the conference.
President Obama's statements and appointments in relation to climate change appear to signal an important policy shift, but much hard work lies ahead here.
Of course, support from the US on this issue is vital, but it is not enough.
We must also secure backing from advanced developing countries such as China.
Secondly, the economic and financial crisis.
The current crisis is both severe and global and requires a strong policy response at all levels and across the world.
The EU and the US have a particular responsibility in this context, both in terms of the measures they take at home and in terms of international coordination.
We must cooperate with the US to ensure that we deliver a coordinated response to the current global crisis and financial problems.
We must work together to address the issue of the supervision of the financial system and the reform of international financial institutions.
We must also coordinate our policies for enhanced growth and employment.
We must make sure that the approaches we choose are compatible and do not give rise to distortions of competition in the transatlantic market place.
Much of this will take place in groups such as the G8 and G20, in particular during the G20 summit in London with which President Obama's visit to Europe will start.
But it is clear that the transatlantic relationship will be key in setting the wider global agenda.
Thirdly, Afghanistan is a key issue for both Europe and the US.
This is a joint problem - terrorist attacks in both the US and Europe have their origins in the region.
It is an important, and uneasy, challenge for all European political leaders to explain to their citizens that their own security must be defended in Kabul.
Afghanistan was also the main subject of an informal meeting of the EU Troika with Vice-President Biden in Brussels on 10 March.
The Vice-President expressed the hope that Afghanistan would remain at the top of the EU agenda.
He was clear that the US was looking not just for our support for the overall strategy in Afghanistan, but also for commitment to match that support with concrete resources.
Knowing that the question of security of Afghan citizens is of major concern, we have undertaken to increase the size of our police mission in the country.
In addition to the EUPOL civilian mission, military police are needed, the 'gendarmeries' which we are talking about.
In this respect, sending gendarmerie trainers on site, as an EU contribution to the NATO mission, is an option which the Presidency has been discussing with the freshly appointed Special Envoy for Pakistan and Afghanistan amongst EU countries.
I have met Pierre Lellouche from France, for example, and we are also discussing this with Dick Holbrooke.
We must also ensure that the conditions are in place for the Presidential elections in Afghanistan to be a success and we must keep the regional aspect in mind, in particular by giving further assistance to the development of sustainable civil government in Pakistan.
So this regional dimension is very important and we are taking account of this in addition to the national dimension and then the global one.
Fourthly, a multilateral response will be crucial to address the risk of proliferation of the weapons of mass destruction.
The EU and the US have expressed growing concerns about the nuclear activities of Iran in particular and its failure to comply with its international obligations in the nuclear area.
The EU and the US together need to ensure that the development of nuclear technology is limited to legitimate, civilian purposes.
The best way of achieving this is to establish strong, internationally binding rules, backed by credible verification mechanisms.
At the same time the EU and the US are ready to engage with Iran in constructive approaches to this and other problems in the region.
A further challenge that we face is how to work together to strengthen the practical applications of rules-based multilateralism based on our shared values.
There is much that we can do together here.
I agree with President Obama's sentiment, underlined by both Secretary Clinton and Vice-President Biden, that any choice between security and ideals is a false one.
In this respect I welcome President Obama's intention to move towards closure of Guantánamo.
We also welcome President Obama's early engagement in addressing the Arab-Israeli conflict, including the appointment of George Mitchell as the special envoy for the region.
A lasting peace that addresses the aspirations of both Israelis and Palestinians is of vital importance to the people of the region and remains a key objective for both the EU and the US.
A peace deal also has the potential to deliver wider benefits, not least greater understanding between the West and the wider Islamic world.
I have read with interest the many recommendations in your report regarding the institutional structure of the transatlantic relationship.
I very much agree that the institutional links between the EU and US should reflect the importance of the relationship.
The initiatives taken by the Czech Presidency serve to underline this point.
We have engaged with the US, and the new Administration, at every level from the outset.
And in 10 days' time the Presidency will welcome President Obama to Prague for an informal summit with EU heads of state and government.
As I have said, this will be an opportunity to assess a number of dimensions of the transatlantic relationship and to confirm our willingness to work together.
These discussions will continue, for example, by holding regular informal meetings of the EU and US foreign ministers.
I also believe that there is a merit in more regular and close contacts between the European Parliament and the US Congress.
I am grateful to this Parliament for its continuing support for the development of the transatlantic relationship, and in particular for your report.
We have a new opportunity this year to develop the relationship further.
For this Presidency, and for the Council, the transatlantic partnership has always been of strategic importance to Europe as a whole.
I can assure you that the Czech Presidency is committed to ensuring that it remains at the heart of our wider external strategy and will play a determining role in addressing the many challenges and problems which confront us globally today.
<D>
Mr President, Commissioner, the proclamation of next year as the European Year of Creativity and Innovation is fully in accord with the aims and priorities of the EU to develop the European knowledge society as a key response of the Europe of 27 to the economic and social challenges of globalisation.
This globalisation blatantly seeks to place at the centre of developments nothing other than the economy, which is in fact all too often the illicit distribution of profits.
Globalisation, if it is to develop into an equitable development policy able to deliver its economic and social benefits to all regions, must be human-centred.
It must provide equal access opportunities for all citizens, in every part of the world.
We have made the right choice in opting for the combination of innovation and creativity as the key dimension of the European Year 2009.
Thus, the 'knowledge triangle' - education, research and innovation, with creativity - makes the citizen the central pillar of the EU development model.
In addition, the choice of 2009 as the Year of Creativity and Innovation is in terms of policy clearly an extension of the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue.
Let me add that with your participation, Mr Figeľ, it is proving to be a great success.
The mobility of knowledge and creativity forms an integral part of open intercultural dialogue.
The aim of this dialogue is to encompass cultural diversity, partnership in business, professional cooperation, social convergence and closer educational alignment among EU citizens.
It is therefore essential that there should be a clear commitment and mobilisation of all social partners, SMEs, educational and professional bodies, as well as Community, national and regional authorities.
The main driving force for all the actions in 2009 will be the educational programmes at national and European level, the Community programmes for lifelong learning, the actions linked to training and education under both the Social Fund and the other Structural Funds, and also the national educational programmes to be included in this Year.
The fields of culture, communications, the job market, young people, women, immigrants, local and regional entities, cultural industries and SMEs are included.
It has been decided that this cooperation should be based on multi-annual and one-year programmes with specified funding for projects, although Parliament would like this Year to have its own budget, as is the case with the Year of Intercultural Dialogue.
Parliament has made amendments that, if anything, will ensure that this Year is funded not primarily through the Community programmes for lifelong learning, but through each programme and sector-based action.
Under this proposal, innovation and creativity will not place a burden on the educational programmes, but will be central to all Community policies.
Let me end by thanking the Commissioner, the Commission departments, and the Slovenian and French Presidencies for the open dialogue and cooperation we have had.
<D>
in writing. - (SK) The lack of unity between existing laws and standards is often a disincentive for consumers and businesses who are considering participating in cross-border trade.
Consumers and businesses encounter obstacles in relation to the differences in market conditions.
There is a need for extensive harmonisation of the contract in question, with a view to retaining a high level of consumer rights protection in particular.
In addition to sectoral variations, the scope of the directive would be limited mainly to off-premises contracts.
It is these contracts that account for the greatest number of cross-border transactions.
Also the issue as to whether a given contract is subject to the harmonised rules depends mainly on the wording of the defined terms.
Some of these are often deficient and unsatisfactory from a legal perspective.
There is a real need to ensure that consumers in all EU Member States are guaranteed a high level of consumer protection and for them to be able to have goods supplied and provided without unnecessary legal obstacles.
This would help to boost consumer confidence, and also to make businesses more interested in cross-border transactions.

author. - Mr President, this morning we will be voting on a joint motion for a resolution co-signed by four political groups on the situation of the Ashraf refugee camp in Iraq.
Three thousand five hundred Iranian men and women, members of the democratic opposition to the fundamentalist regime in Iran, live there completely defenceless.
In the last few weeks they have been under pressure and harassment by the faction of the Iraqi Government under the influence of the Iranian regime, and there is a high probability that at any moment a tragedy could happen that would parallel the ones we witnessed in the Balkans not so long ago.
We all remember Srebrenica, and I have no doubt that no Member in this Chamber wants a second Srebrenica in Iraq.
Our motion for a resolution is a call to alert public opinion all over the world before a disaster takes place.
Unfortunately, some colleagues have tabled amendments that could increase the danger for the residents in Camp Ashraf and provide the Iranian regime and its proxies in Iraq with arguments to massacre them.
I recently visited the camp myself and I assure you that the allegations included in the amendments tabled are absolutely unfounded.
People in Ashraf are there on a volunteer basis.
They are free to leave whenever they want and they live in the best friendly relations with the Iraqi population of the region.
The intention of our motion is to protect these people.
Nobody would understand - but if these amendments are adopted the result of the motion would be exactly the opposite.
This is not a political issue, colleagues: it is purely humanitarian and it is very urgent.
I beg you to vote against all amendments tabled to this joint motion supported by these four groups and support the motion as it has been agreed by these four groups that are of very different political stances.
The lives of many innocent and harmless people depend on your vote.
Please do not let them down.
<D>
The present day and age demands rapid adaptation of transport to the exponential growth in its use and in the expectations of society.
I think, therefore, that the introduction of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) is extremely useful.
We should be aware that the current state of affairs in road transport is very worrying.
This is illustrated by such statistics as:
the number of deaths on the roads in the EU in 2006 was about 43 000, including about 5 500 in Poland;
the annual cost of road traffic congestion in the EU is about 1% of GDP;
CO2 emissions caused by road transport amount to about 70% of all transport-related CO2 emissions.
The following are, therefore, necessary:
optimal use of road and road traffic data;
ensuring continuity and reliability of ITS services in European transport corridors and conurbations;
extensive use in large urban areas of telematic applications, which combine transport issues with information technology and telecommunications;
rapid and harmonised introduction of applications which support road traffic safety, such as eCall, ADAS and others;
better integration of the transport infrastructure with vehicles and between vehicles;
Europe-wide coordination, making use of the experience and good practices of leading countries.
Let us try, therefore, to implement ITS throughout the EU, in relation to all means of transport and all passengers, and with regard to both public and private transport.
<D>
(HU) President Buzek, allow me to address you directly, even though you are sitting in your member's seat.
Your election in this Parliament has been viewed as a sign that there is no longer an Eastern bloc, but a united Europe.
You mentioned this in your address when you talked about there being no more old and new Europe, just our Europe.
Unfortunately, many people do not feel this way.
You also referred in your address to the great fear that pervaded the countries which joined only in 2004.
Today, however, you are aware of the sense of disappointment felt in these countries.
The reason for this is that there is no equality of rights.
Equal rights are the key issue.
Mr Lindblad, the state secretary, mentioned that equality of rights was the budget's fundamental principle.
If this really is the case, why is there no equality of rights with regard to agricultural subsidies?
Hungary proved that it is able to receive them with its institutional system, yet it is still discriminated against.
Mr President, you have encouraged everyone to use their mother tongue.
I am pleased that in this Parliament, as a Hungarian, I can enjoy equal rights, but in Slovakia I would be punished for using my mother tongue.
Mr President, you have suggested acting as a mediator.
We sincerely thank you for this offer.
However, a real result will only be achieved by this action if the Hungarian minority can freely use their mother tongue in the land of their birth.
I wish you every success with this too.

Mr President, I welcome the agreement reached last week on the climate change package and congratulate our rapporteurs and the French presidency for their efficiency.
It was important to keep our ambitious targets, but in the current economic turmoil we could not afford to impose an impossible burden on our industry and impede European competitiveness.
This is why, in particular for the effort-sharing decision, I warmly welcome the flexibility granted to Member States to reach their targets while introducing corrective action instead of sanctions.
This has always been my position in the Committee on Industry, but I want to repeat it.
Flexibility is needed and this is even more crucial when regulating new sectors and, before imposing stricter provisions, we need impact assessments.
I am also very satisfied that codecision was ensured in the case of a higher reduction target.
It is a matter of principle.
Our citizens did not send us here not to have a say in such important decisions.
<D>
Madam President, the debates and discussions around the fiscal system for savings have taken such a passionate turn that it has become disturbing.
I do not hesitate to defend what appears to be a minority position here, but we will see what happens tomorrow, even though our rapporteur and the commissioner are still mixing up the sheep and the goats.
Let us go back to the root of the problem.
The Directive on savings taxation came into force in 2005 with the aim of taxing the capital revenues of non-residents.
Two systems are involved here: exchange of information between tax authorities and withholding tax.
What are we finding after several years of operation?
Official and unofficial studies all show that exchange of information is seriously failing, because it is complicated, burdensome and costly.
Withholding tax, on the other hand, shows many virtues.
What do you think is deduced from all this - above all by our rapporteur and the commissioner?
Well, that the system that does not work and does not guarantee the payment of tax due will be made compulsory.
Understand that one if you can!
The issue is not lacking in piquancy, as it will also be noted that the system of withholding tax is constantly gaining ground in the various Member States - 19 out of 27 are applying it to their general satisfaction.
However, what is good enough at home becomes unacceptable once you cross the border.
This logic will just lead to an unravelling of what we have been building here for decades, in other words the single market in financial services.
The Community acquis of the free movement of capital is also called into question, as the so-called major countries are pushing for repatriation of their residents' capital.
However, any blow can now be struck in the fight against this new Hydra of banking secrecy.
I say to my fellow Members who are fighting against this so-called monster that is guilty of all sins: you have chosen the wrong target by confusing the issues in the framework of this directive and, above all, you are deluding yourselves.
To finish, Madam President, I hope that many of my fellow Members will heed the voice of reason and vote for Amendment 28 by my group, which will lead to no less than allowing the Member States a free choice between withholding tax and exchange of information.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, in my view, a European response to constant waves of price rises and increasing poverty is long overdue, and indeed it is gratifying that the new draft EU-wide social package makes a start in the right direction.
The intention to facilitate access to health care in other European countries, for example, is to be welcomed.
In practice, holidaymakers, for instance, are all too often shamelessly exploited today, being presented with doctors' bills for which they are only partly reimbursed, if at all, when they go back home.
Conversely, individual Member States owe each other millions of euros - mere declarations of intent are not enough in such cases.
Nor is it sufficient to beat the drum for causes such as a better balance between family and working life.
So that more people can afford to have children, it is essential to act against wage dumping and social dumping - a task which, sad to say, is being largely neglected.
It is a travesty that the EU decrees, on the one hand, that public contracts must be put out to public tender and that the clause requiring successful tenderers to pay at least the statutory minimum wage is then revoked by the European Court of Justice on the grounds of incompatibility with the directives on services in the internal market and on the posting of workers.
In this the EU has shown its true colours as a purely economic community that fobs off the socially underprivileged with peanuts and empty words.
Empty catchphrases can no longer pacify the citizens of the EU, nor can they cushion the impact of a falling birth rate and increasing poverty.
Maybe you can say what you like on paper, but people are undoubtedly tired of empty promises.
<D>
(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, the current financial crisis is proof that, when a problem is global, we need global action.
This is particularly true in food and agriculture.
This is largely why the World Trade Organisation was created, and we all agree on this.
The WTO tries to have globalised rules.
However, it seems that this does not function exactly as we would like, because we are faced with the following problem: we need to reconcile two things, the free trade that we all agree on, and protection, which is also necessary.
Protecting our economies or national agriculture is not a byword for protectionism.
To do this, the road that we have taken over the past 60 years, since GATT, has been a rocky one, with tariffs being cut with a view to scrapping them altogether.
Technically, lowering customs tariffs seems to be difficult.
As proof, look at the number of mathematical formulas that exist for this purpose: the South Korean formula, the European formula, and of course the Swiss formula.
This does not really work, because a product is not unitary.
It is composed of numerous elements with very different rules of origin, so technically, reducing customs tariffs is not as simple as we might think.
Therefore, we find ourselves in a technical rut, and it is through negotiations that we are trying, politically, to find a way out of this rut.
However, scientists have apparently invented a new customs technology: customs tariffs that are deductible for the exporter against the importing state's economy.
In concrete terms, this deductible customs tariff amounts to a customs credit equal to the amount of duty that the exporter has incurred in the importing country.
There are three sides to this customs credit: it is refundable, negotiable and transferable.
First of all, it is refundable: when the exporter goes to buy something from the importer, he can deduct the amount of duty paid.
Secondly, it is negotiable, because if the exporting company, which has paid duty, has nothing to buy from the importer, it can sell its customs credit on the stock market or to a bank.
Finally, it is transferable: to help developing countries, the importer can donate the surplus customs credit above the amount of customs duty.
Well, with this technique, we create a trade currency, where the money supply is equal to the amount of existing customs tariffs.
The European Union, for example, would provide EUR 13 billion in trade currency.
<D>
(FI) Madam President, the debate on the very recent European Chemicals Regulation, REACH, is still in our memories.
It was one of the toughest legislative packages this term.
The regulation on the classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures we are now dealing with is partly based on, and complements, the REACH Regulation that has just entered into force.
That is why it gave rise to a lot of questions beforehand.
The Commission's desire for an agreement at first reading initially seemed a bit too ambitious, given that Parliament had previously indicated its interest in legislation on chemicals.
I can therefore only admire the creditable work and leadership of my colleague, Mrs Sartori, with respect to this technical report, and how she managed to avoid the temptation of revising the regulation too much and, for example, incorporating new paragraphs and classifications of substances in the annexes, which would have slowed down and even prevented the regulation's entry into force.
The report which we worked through on the committees is likely to achieve the targets set for the regulation, especially regarding the harmonisation and simplification of legislation.
GHS and REACH complement one another and do not just facilitate the work of the producers and distributors of chemicals.
Instead, clear and safe labelling will mean a return to consumer confidence in them.
When the work of the Committee began, people were worried that the GHS Regulation would mean that a large number of detergents, for example, would have to be classified as corrosive in the same way.
This way, for example, agents for unblocking pipes and washing-up liquids would have the same classification and package labelling, with the result that consumers would not be able to distinguish between hazardous products and milder detergents.
Now, however, the classifications of substances reflect their actual potential danger as well as can be expected.
The aim of this system, based as it is on a UN agreement, is that the same criteria should apply to the classification and labelling of chemicals and the regulations on the transportation, sales and use of chemicals all over the world.
Under the agreement it would be fully operative by 2008.
We still have a few months left to go.
<D>
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has always strongly supported the principle that those people directly affected should have control over development strategies, as this means that their priorities are really taken into account.
In this report we have therefore naturally emphasised that national parliaments and civil society need to be involved in the new EU-Africa strategy.
This involvement has to a large extent been missing from the preparations that are currently being made for this new strategy, which seeks to open up a new form of strategic partnership.
We urgently need to put this right.
In this context we very much welcome the initiative by the Portuguese Presidency to invite delegations from the European and Pan-African Parliaments to attend the December summit in Lisbon.
Let us hope that this is not just a symbolic gesture.
We have also insisted - and Mrs Martens mentioned this just now - that there must be real coherence between the different European policies.
This means that the measures adopted as part of our policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries and immigration, for example, have to take special account of any repercussions there may be for development in the countries of the South and in Africa in particular.
We have also recalled that the European Union promised to do everything possible to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and to take all necessary steps to eradicate poverty.
With this in mind we are insisting that the new EU-Africa strategy should clearly state its commitments and specify the concrete measures needed to ensure that they are honoured as far as Africa is concerned.
As regards the Economic Partnership Agreements our position is quite clear: we are in no way opposed, either ideologically or on any other basis, to the signing of agreements sanctioning the terms of a partnership that would be beneficial to Europeans and to the peoples of the ACP (African, Caribbean and Pacific) countries alike.
However, we will resolutely oppose any agreement that, once signed, puts the peoples of Africa, in particular, in a position that is less favourable than the one they know today.
This is the aim of the amendment that we have tabled.
Finally, I would like to point out that, as things stand at present, we still do not know the wording that is to be put forward at the next Lisbon Summit.
You informed us that the document in question was being drafted.
We shall therefore pay very close attention to the manner in which the recommendations we have made in our report are taken into account in the drafting of this document and shall naturally reserve the right to react accordingly as soon as the text is made known to us.
<D>
in writing. - As was said, the report aims to highlight the need to implement the principle of gender equality in the common agricultural policy as a way of promoting sustainable economic growth and rural development.
Therefore the EU needs to refocus its EU support strategies in order to develop the rural areas in a women-friendly way.
Promotion of the entrepreneurial attitude and skills of women in agriculture, improving access and specific training for women, equipment of rural areas with the most up-to-date IT infrastructure, greater recognition and more support for women's networks, fostering the quality and accessibility of infrastructure facilities and service, adequate social security benefits for women working in agriculture, shared ownership of farms, specific attention for female immigrants are among the most important points which the different political groups agreed on.
Well, who would vote against it?
How unspecified and populist it is!
It seems that the rapporteur showed her kindness to women working in agriculture.
Nothing specific is said about children and healthcare.
Lack of efficient healthcare!
The lack of efficient healthcare and pre-school education in rural areas is precisely what concerns women from Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania.
I voted 'for'; however, the report is raw and unprofessional.
<D>
rapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, welcome to this debate, attended by the Secretary-General and of course welcome to Mr Kallas.
I cannot welcome anyone from the Council, as it appears that it does not have anything to do with accounts and taking responsibility for the political debate on discharge.
I hope that when the Council has a president, after the Treaty of Lisbon, we will be guaranteed that the Council will also be present at this debate.
I would first like to congratulate my colleague Dan Jørgensen on his excellent report, and highlight from what he said how well things are being done in the European Union, and how they are being done better every year.
He referred on several occasions to an initiative by Commissioner Kallas and the Commission on transparency.
I was rapporteur two months ago for an own-initiative report supporting the transparency policy.
Well, the Commission is indeed making progress on transparency policy, as Parliament has also done.
I would like to point out that the role of Parliament in giving discharge is a political role, and that we are not and nor should we be accountants.
It is a political role, and the question that we have to answer for citizens is: with the money that Parliament has, have we been able to meet the budgetary challenges for the 2006 financial year?
Challenges such as Parliament preparing for enlargement, to receive new Member States, expanding the information policy, doing our work better, preparing ourselves for the challenge of Lisbon, in that we are going to have to legislate more and in the best possible way.
What is the political verdict on what we have done with these financial commitments?
It is a positive one.
We have done well.
I would like to highlight a few points from this financial year.
Firstly, on the initiative of President Hans Pöttering, we have initiated a political dialogue between the Presidency and the procedure for discharge, which until now did not appear to be possible.
Now it is possible, and your vice-president was present at the debate, facing up to the questions put to him live and direct by the committee.
Also, on the initiative of the President, the Bureau is going to have a regular procedure of working with the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control, so I thank you.
Many aspects of transparency in Parliament have improved, as you can see in the report.
We have improved the presentation of the roles of our assistants.
What has not been possible this year has been for us to finally create a statute for assistants, which we are asking for.
The truth is that as MEPs it has taken us a long time to have our own statute.
In short, we will have to ask for patience, but we must emphasise that we have not yet achieved this objective.
In 2006, however, the reference year, 99% of papers were submitted in the right way, so I think that this issue is also moving in the right direction.
We have outstanding problems, and on these we are more or less trying to do what we can.
Citizens do not understand why Parliament should have three locations, they do not understand it, and they are not going to understand it because it is not easy to understand.
This is another challenge for when the Council has a president: finding a solution.
Parliament has, however, done its duty and reduced the cost of the three locations from EUR 203 million in 2002 to EUR 155 million.
We have cut the bill by 24%, which is good.
What challenges are we going to tackle, as I mention in this report?
As I have just said, giving our assistants a definitive statute, as we have ourselves.
There is also the challenge of legislating better.
Parliament is going to play a much greater qualitative role and have a much larger workload with the Lisbon Treaty when it comes.
Let us hope that the Belgian Government, now that we have a Belgian Government, will treat us a little better in terms of buildings policy than it has up to now, as its treatment has been mediocre.
I would like to finish by saying that we have had a prudent year in terms of our budgetary responsibilities, and this is why I am asking you to vote in favour of these accounts for 2006.
<D>
(RO) It is useful that we can have a debate this evening based on the declaration which the Commission and you, Commissioner, have already made concerning the use of waste oils in feed preparation in Ireland.
I would like to extend the debate slightly to tell you that a very large number of Member States, including Romania which I am going to speak about, have been affected by this incident, or to put it more precisely: the incident has affected the meat industry but, above all, consumers.
It has affected the industry, which has recorded major losses in an extremely short space of time, and consumers at a time when, at least in Romania, there is usually a significant consumption of pork, in keeping with the tradition of celebrating Christmas.
The one thing which has functioned extremely well is the notification of the veterinary authorities via the European rapid alert system.
However, apart from this measure, all the information has disappeared.
What quantity of contaminated meat was involved, where was it distributed and where are the food products were the questions to which partial answers were given, although, in some cases, none at all.
What has been the effect of this?
A panic reaction among consumers and huge losses for producers, as well as the fairly poor ability on the part of the responsible authorities to manage such an incident effectively.
In my view, we have at least two problems.
The first is the dioxin contamination as a result of using waste oils, given that dioxin is, as we all know, a substance which poses a major hazard as it is highly toxic to the human organism, even in tiny quantities.
What can we do to ensure that such an incident never happens again?
The second problem is: how do we improve the ability of the responsible authorities in the Member States to respond and take action in such dangerous situations?
On a final note, I hope that this debate will give us some answers, at least to these two questions.
<D>
(SV) Madam President, first let me congratulate the rapporteur on a report which is not just extremely good but is also timely.
Mr Saryusz-Wolski has done an extremely important job in shifting the focus from energy as a matter of our convenience to energy as a question of geopolitical importance.
It is precisely the geopolitical and security dimension which is uppermost in the minds of those of us who were born behind the Iron Curtain, but which western Europe has long neglected.
For that reason, perhaps, it is the most important element that the rapporteur brings to this debate.
We need to develop a common policy in order to protect our common interests better in this extremely important strategic area.
I am grateful to Mr Saryusz-Wolski for having the courage to present this report, which contains a number of important and innovative ideas.
We should indeed bear in mind that secure energy supplies are of vital interest to hundreds of millions of Europe's citizens.
Finally, Mr Saryusz-Wolski is quite right to say that we need to speak with one voice on this matter, precisely because the energy question is also quite clearly a security question.
All our experience of foreign and security policy shows that, every time we have failed to speak with a single voice, we have lost out and our citizens have paid the price.
Hence I can only urge that we support Mr Saryusz-Wolski's report in its entirety.
<D>
I would like to begin my speech by raising again the idea which I spoke about on Monday during the opening of the plenary session.
You are holding the presidency during a period which has a special significance for us.
This year marks 20 years since the fall of the Iron Curtain.
I was saying on Monday that for us, but especially for the millions of citizens who have sent us here, these 20 years have marked a period of waiting, to some extent, and acceptance, to another extent.
Perhaps it was normal for us not to be able to escape more quickly from the burden of the 50 years which separated us from the rest of Europe.
I wanted to make an intervention to congratulate you on including the third priority, Europe in the World, but especially for dealing with the Eastern Partnership as a priority.
The histories of our two countries, Romania and the Czech Republic, have two strong features in common: 1968 and then the Prague Spring, which represented for us Romanians, subjected to the most cruel Communist dictatorship, a ray of light which guided us along the path to freedom.
As a Romanian MEP, I would like to ask you to give proper, specific substance to the Eastern Partnership.
There are millions of citizens in this region who need to rekindle this hope by symbolically going through again now, in the forthcoming months, the events of the Prague Spring.
Both you and I have the opportunity to understand perfectly the weight of this expectation.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - I said that this is a common cause, a common endeavour, and there are many good ideas and ongoing initiatives at European and national level, plus many at regional and municipal level.
I am happy that there is this kind of strong interest, even internationally, to see opportunities and to seek the opportunity to promote an intercultural approach instead of 'multi-culti' comments and laments.
I think we need this.
I do not intend to read out the projects themselves; they are quite inspirational - especially at EU level - because these were selected from many at EU level, and they are very different to those as the level of the Member States.
In fact we have 28, because in Belgium there are two main communities and support.
We think that the Member States which involve the young generation, which are really open to the future, are probably the best examples of addressing the challenges of living in diversity, and also promoting unity.
Projects like Diversidad, which is run by the European music office.
Here we see a combination of very popular activities: music, music interpretation, listening to music, learning via music, and dialogue with urban culture.
The International Yehudi Menuhin Foundation; Ton monde est le mien, something which reflects that we need others to understand ourselves; A Unique Brussels, which is a network of EU institutes of culture; Alter Ego, a contribution to intercultural dialogue, cross-cultural understanding, and European citizenship by young people through collaborative art projects, which can make them reach beyond their normal social circles.
One project is by the European Cultural Foundation - Stranger.
This is about young people expressing themselves and creating a platform where they can link their experience to the wider European context.
Last but not least, I think it is very important that Parliament is involved as much as possible, individually or collectively.
There are many occasions - events in Brussels, for example - on different topics connected to intercultural dialogue.
We as a Commission will invite the Committee on Culture as a body (this also means Members) to all the events we are participating in or co-organising.
We will have, for example, a European Youth Week in November, and I think they should come.
Some of the events should be organised in the premises of Parliament in Brussels, with the participation of parliamentarians and, of course, young people from all countries including non-EU members.
There are many occasions where you can have a say and, especially, set an example and show your commitment.
I believe this should not be just a one-year story.
It must be a long-term objective and a process where we learn, participate and mature in order to ensure a better century than the 20th century, which was one of many divisions, conflicts and ideologies opposing human dignity.
So I think there is strong momentum for your involvement.
<D>
(NL) Madam President, if nothing else, the negotiations with Turkey have helped the Commission and Council perfect the art of euphemisms.
The way in which the problems in Turkey are being minimised is starting to become impressive.
This has even become the subject of occasional ridicule in Turkey.
The catalogue of problems is so extensive that it is puzzling that the negotiations are still carrying on.
Indeed, the Commission had promised that the negotiation process would keep pace with the reform process in Turkey.
This promise has well and truly been broken now, because new chapters are being opened constantly.
The balance sheet of more than three years of negotiations is positively lamentable.
Let us therefore pull the plug.
Turkey is not a European country and does not, therefore, belong to the European Union, but let us instead work out a relationship of privileged partnership.
<D>
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) On behalf of the PSE Group, a word of thanks to the rapporteurs, the Commission's officials and the Slovenian Presidency.
This subject has a long history.
After all, the earlier Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 is one of the first items of legislation on the free movement of workers in Europe.
The proposed simplification is designed to ensure a faster service for the European citizen when he claims entitlements and at the same time better verification of the legitimacy of such claims.
Cooperation between payment agencies and improved data exchange are very important factors here.
The implementing rules must also ensure that frontier workers and other entitled persons do not have any break in their entitlement.
From the second reading our Group sees three remaining points which may need further consideration.
Firstly, there are still two different rules in deciding whether someone is an employee or a self-employed person with no staff.
In the social security context the definition used is the one applicable in the country of origin, whilst in the employment context the definition applied to seconded workers is that applicable in the country of employment.
Until such time as we arrive at a clear European definition of self-employment, this subject is guaranteed to keep coming up for discussion in Parliament.
A second point is that of information to entitled persons.
In the Commission text, since amended, details of when entitled persons should receive information from the competent authorities, and on what topics, were scattered too widely over a number of different articles.
A clear summary of the right to information, given at a central point in this legislation, would make the position substantially clearer for entitled persons.
A third point of concern is the scrutiny of compliance.
We know from the earlier Regulation that registration in the Member States and cooperation and coordination between the competent authorities sometimes worked very poorly.
It would be a very good idea for Parliament to be kept informed of how the relevant rules are being implemented in future.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mrs Lynne for her report; it comes just at the right time.
A word to all Members of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats: wage discrimination against women has been included in the Treaty for the last 40 years, yet, nothing has essentially changed.
If you in the PPE-DE Group wish to abide by your rejection of a horizontal directive, it is very clear to me that your values and principles relate to fine words and celebrations in the European Union.
You do not want equal treatment at all!
You accept discrimination against gays and lesbians, for example.
You want this to be a political culture.
No, that will not do for me!
Equal opportunities encompass all the criteria of Article 13, and multiple discrimination ultimately has to be included, too.
Anti-discrimination policy can only be credible if it itself does not discriminate further.
There has been a flood of proceedings and actions in the European Union.
This was all propaganda aimed at avoiding certain minimum standards.
The Member States that have stopped short of this just have to make haste.
Infringement procedures have been initiated, even against my own country, Germany.
I now appeal to the Commission, to each individual Commissioner, to state clearly that they are in favour of a clear horizontal directive and putting paid to a hierarchic arrangement of human rights in the European Union.
We have to implement our EU policy in accordance with the Treaty.
Article 13 is part of the Treaty and must therefore encompass all this, as stated in the Lynne report.
<D>
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is only one reason why we wish to have a debate this evening and that is that the attacks from the American side, by both Boeing and many members of Congress, on the awarding of the contract to Northrop Grumman/EADS are very bitter and even go as far as to target individual Member States.
That is the reason why we are holding a debate here and why there will also be a resolution, for which I am very thankful, because we in the committee have been trying for a long time to bring this resolution about.
The frustration is directed against the fact that Northrop Grumman/EADS presented a better offer, to which the US Air Force gave preference over a Boeing model in a public tender.
That is the most natural thing in the world.
We are dealing here with NATO partners and not with countries who do not work together regularly.
We have the Transatlantic Partnership, which is reaffirmed at every summit meeting.
In the three stated areas, Europe purchases four times as much from the Americans, and so, to that extent, we already have a very intensive mutual 'partnership'.
There is absolutely no reason for the Americans to be frustrated, and that is what we want to make clear here.
We do not need to go into the details again - I am very grateful that the Commissioner and Mr Papastamkos have already done that.
It is essentially a political protest that we want to voice today - and which, by the way, repeatedly influences the WTO discussion on the American side, because comments are constantly being made.
The US Air Force cannot be permitted to award a contract to, among others, a European consortium, at the same time as a WTO case is being decided.
This makes it plain that the two issues are interwoven politically, but the Commissioner is absolutely right when she points out that, in reality, they are not connected.
I should like personally to thank the Commission and the Member States for repeatedly setting great store by getting the facts right.
I should also like to thank my fellow Members for the fact that we are finally having this discussion and can present the resolution.
I hope this means that the Americans will give us a good hearing.
<D>
(EL) The big word missing from immigration programmes is the word 'solidarity'.
Today, we voted on the resettlement of asylum seekers from third countries in Europe, but the Commission programme refuses to promote a similar provision for the settlement of asylum seekers from one country of Europe to another or for money.
Whatever happened to solidarity?
Over 100 000 illegal immigrants arrive in Greece from Turkey every year.
Whatever happened to the Europe-Turkey agreement on the return of these illegal immigrants?
It is being side-stepped and is barely even mentioned in our programme.
Whatever happened to the agreement being negotiated by Frontex with Turkey today?
Can you assure us that it will not directly or indirectly dispute the sovereign rights of Greece, and hence of Europe, on the borders?
Finally, of course, there is the huge obligation of solidarity towards immigrants themselves called 'integration'.
Without the integration of immigrants, there is no way that 40 million people who have come to live among us will be able to do so on equal terms.
We may be building time bombs.
Programmes are needed, money is needed and, at the moment, the Commission does not have them.
<D>
Two months ago in plenary, and it was also during a debate on human rights, we condemned the attack on the Governor of the Province of Punjab, Salman Taseer.
The subject of discussion was the same as the one we are talking about today - attempts at reforming the controversial blasphemy legislation.
The two tragic events are closely related to each other, because the victims had worked together on behalf of national minorities in Pakistan, including religious minorities, and in defence of those who have fallen victim to the ideology of intolerance spread by the Taliban.
Unfortunately, the Western world can only look on at the advancing radicalisation of attitudes in the country, where not even a decade ago, Benazir Bhutto was introducing democratic reforms.
Pakistan is sinking into chaos - the Taliban are terrorising the country and with increasing frequency are carrying out attacks like the one which took place in Punjab on 8 March, for example, in which 25 people were killed.
Reports have now appeared of the next person whom the extremists have sentenced to death - Member of the Pakistani Parliament, former journalist and defender of women's rights, religious minorities and freedom of speech, Sherry Rehman.
It was she who submitted to the Pakistani Parliament a draft of amendments to legislation on punishments for blasphemy.
At the next part-session, will we be condemning an attack made on her?
<D>
The environmental disaster in the Gulf of Mexico highlighted the lack of safety and security of oil operations.
This heart-breaking tragedy, which claimed human lives and did untold damage to the environment, must also be an important lesson to us in Europe.
I welcome the Commission's initiative to carry out a test of the safety of offshore oil platforms operating in the territory of the European Union.
However, in order to ensure this fully, it is necessary to take measures on a wider scale.
Above all, the Commission should assess the European Union's capacity for immediate and effective response to accidents and develop a European action plan.
Current regulation is clearly lacking in content and scope, both in terms of safety and responsibility for damage done.
Huge infrastructure projects are currently being implemented in the European Union whose safety has perhaps not been assessed comprehensively and properly.
This includes the much debated Nord Stream gas pipeline and other oil and gas infrastructure, which is necessary for Europe to achieve energy security, but which must satisfy environmental requirements of the highest level.
The issue of responsibility must therefore be resolved clearly: the polluter compensates for damage done and furthermore, it is necessary to adopt compulsory EU-wide insurance schemes.
In order to avoid similar disasters, particular attention should be paid to preventive measures.
Therefore, in my opinion, the Commission should analyse the establishment of an effective monitoring system, strengthen inspection methods and tighten minimum compulsory EU safety rules.
I agree with the proposals made by our colleagues for the Commission to also provide annual reports, which would allow us to both assess the true situation and take measures in time, as and when necessary.
In conclusion, I would like to thank the Commission and the Member of the Commission for the fact that we will have a communication so soon and will be able to begin to examine in more detail what Europe really needs.
<D>
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, I am also pleased with, and welcome, the measures announced by the Commission.
It appears that in some cases they go even further than those requested by Parliament in its motion for a resolution.
The fact that we have managed to make space for a debate on this issue during this very busy part-session gives some idea of the importance this House places on the matter.
I believe that in these somewhat unsettled times Europeans should tackle this crisis together using an effective and unbiased mechanism: that could take the form of the much-demanded increase in flexibility of the European Fisheries Fund (EFF), which would enable us to adopt urgent measures at Community level.
National solutions like those proposed by some Member States would only lead to imbalances.
We hope, Commissioner, that at the meeting of the Council of Ministers next Monday the Commission will be able to clarify matters even further and reach agreement with the Council of Ministers on how the EFF can be used to help the segments of the fleet that have been most affected.
It also appears to be urgent to examine once and for all the price-setting mechanism.
<D>
rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, I am pleased that this discussion has been held and about what each of you, and the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commission, have contributed.
I believe that through this discussion, something resembling a common philosophy is emerging.
I have heard many calls for a more consistent policy, a more credible policy, which avoids double standards, and it seems to me that these are the issues we need to keep working on.
I learned a lot in writing this report, through discussions with various people.
I truly believe there is still a lot of work to do, and that the basis of this future work shall and must be a comprehensive and exhaustive evaluation of the current sanctions policy because, when the question is asked - and we see it today with Russia - things immediately get very heated, and the media are instantly on the lookout.
We therefore need a very solid philosophy and we really have to be in step and in agreement about our procedures and policy.
I think that to do this - I am coming back to the question of the network of experts - it is not a matter of using technical expertise to replace sensitive political decisions, but of ensuring that the sensitive political decisions are based as far as possible on objective information.
When you engage in a sanctions policy, you have to see it through and to respect what many of you have called 'completely objective benchmarks', which let you measure the real effectiveness of the sanctions.
I believe we are making really concrete progress.
There are still a few points to be clarified - you will all have realised this from several of the speeches - and these were the reason for my abstention in the Committee on Foreign Affairs.
I think, ladies and gentlemen, that we cannot sell ourselves short on requirements for full respect for human rights and international law in drawing up blacklists, in putting people's names on these lists or taking them off.
The Court of Justice judgment you have just talked about, Mr Jouyet, fully encourages us to pursue this.
Ladies and gentlemen, I invite you to adopt, not a perfect report, but a very honourable report of which we can be proud, and which will be a good working tool.
<D>
(SK) My thanks go to Mrs Haug for her excellent report.
The draft budget for 2009 on the one hand allows for the consolidation of programmes approved for the financial period of 2007 to 2013 and, on the other hand, puts new emphasis on the need to resolve urgent issues and challenges.
In regional policy, it is in our interests to improve the social and economic situation of the inhabitants of underdeveloped regions.
Our objective is to reduce the inequality between European regions.
In comparison with 2008, payments under expenditure sub-heading 1b have decreased by almost 14 %.
We of course wish to be able to face up to the current and future challenges while respecting the principle of solidarity within the whole of the Community.
We must therefore ensure that the resources we need for cohesion policy will continue to be guaranteed in the future.
In order to be able to convince our citizens that their financial resources are being used responsibly, we must ensure the effective implementation of operational programmes and large projects.
The analyses and subsequent measures put forward by Member States will thus play a key role.
It will be important to assess the results of cohesion policy for the period 2000 to 2006.
<D>
Madam President, how wonderful it is to see you in the chair.
When I give speeches in my constituency of London - for those of you who may have heard of London, the greatest city in the world, capital of the greatest country in the world - it is often pointed out to me by my constituents that they thought in 1973 that we were joining a customs union.
Then I say, 'Do you not understand the nature of the beast?
Do you not understand the nature of the European project?
It is all about further political and economic integration'.
In fact in my first week in Parliament the leader of my group, Hans-Gert Pöttering, stood up and said, 'Nothing must be allowed to get in the way of European integration; nothing must be allowed to get in the way of the European project'.
So clearly, there is a misapprehension of the nature of the project in my constituency.
My plea to you, those of you in this Chamber who support the project, is: please be honest about its intentions.
If you seek to deny the truth about this project, then, once you ask the people, they will reject it, as they did in the referendum in Ireland.
<D>
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, I want to pick up on certain of the aspects from the employment side of things - and not least the context, given that the Spring Summit was at one time supposed to be the 'sustainable development summit' - and to link that with the Commission document from late last year on new skills and new jobs.
That document mentioned how the transition to low-carbon economies would have an important impact on employment.
It is very important that we remember that and do not lose sight of it in the general discussion that we are having at the moment.
What I would like to see coming out of much of the concern about employment at the moment is a very coherent package as regards new industries and new investment.
We are not seeing this at the moment.
We have an excellent example downstairs at the moment of solar technology and how that is developing in a part of Germany, whereas at the same time we are seeing job losses in the solar sector in Spain and in the wind-turbine sector in the UK.
Just at the point we are looking for new skills in new technologies, we also run the risk of losing them through lack of a clear investment strategy and, indeed, a clear skills development strategy within that.
Therefore, when we talk about many of the issues around retraining and developing skills etc., we should also be looking at the so-called Just Transition Programme, worked out with the ILO, the ITUC and the UN, because the skills we are looking for at the moment are beginning to change.
We need to develop the skills of those who still have problems with literacy and numeracy and, indeed, IT, but we are also looking for transversal skills - which is something else out of the Commission's document.
We should also be considering what we do with sectors that have been orphan sectors in terms of skill developments - not least the care sector at the moment - and really look at how we can ensure equality there.
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, helping patients who suffer from rare diseases has long been a major concern of the European Parliament.
Patients who suffer from rare diseases - this has been said - need European support.
National efforts in this area do not suffice.
Because these diseases are so rare, there are not centres and experts for them in every Member State.
For research - and this is a very important point - you need a certain number of patients for the disease to be researched at all and for it to be possible to develop new therapies.
The same applies to the development of new drugs.
Mrs Grossetête talked of the Regulation on orphan medicinal products, which is very important.
The Commission's initiative, Commissioner, is also very important.
We in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats support you wholeheartedly on this and we also support the many improvements that have been made by Mr Trakatellis in this report.
I have to say, however, on behalf of my group, that there is one amendment in Mr Trakatellis's report that goes against this fundamental aim of helping patients.
Amendment 15 talks of how genetic diseases should be avoided and eradicated through measures such as genetic counselling and the selection of embryos.
This wording has shocked many people, and not only the ethics experts and the representatives of disabled groups, but scientists, too.
The European Society of Human Genetics is calling on us to reject Amendment 15.
They are making comparisons with the eugenics of the first half of the last century.
Politics should not exert pressure.
Genetic counselling, likewise, should not be dominated by a political goal.
We should therefore reject Amendment 15.
We should vote in favour of this report - provided that Amendment 15 is rejected - as it is a sound report.
Otherwise, it will be highly problematic.
We should be helping people with rare diseases, not giving them the feeling that they are actually surplus to requirements.
<D>
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, Mr Mugabe claimed a diplomatic victory at Lisbon in that he had 'defeated the British'.
In a way he was right.
Instead of attending the conference himself, Gordon Brown sent Baroness Amos, who is, with no disrespect to the Baroness, a relatively minor figure in the British Government.
In the same way, he will send his errand boy, Mr Miliband, off to Lisbon on Thursday to sign up to the Lisbon Treaty.
It fell to Angela Merkel to rebuke Mr Mugabe with wonderful, almost British understatement that 'Zimbabwe damages the image of the new Africa'.
Well, you could certainly say that!
Mr Brown should have attended the conference and taken the opportunity to tell Mr Mugabe to his face that he is a bloodthirsty tyrant who has no place in the modern community of civilised nations.
That would have given heart to oppressed Zimbabweans, and it would also have required real leadership - which is precisely why it did not happen.
<D>
President-in-Office. - (SL) To begin with I should like to express my gratitude for the report prepared by Mrs Ria Oomen-Ruijten, which in the opinion of the Council represents an important contribution to the debate regarding Turkey's accession process.
The Slovenian Presidency has been encouraging Turkey to make further progress in its process of moving close to joining the European Union.
A debate is currently under way in the Council on the eight remaining reports on the legislation alignment reviews, the so-called screening reports.
If the technical preparations make good progress, maybe we shall be able to open two new chapters at the EU - Turkey accession conference in June.
As regards the reforms in Turkey, we agree with the European Parliament's assessment that this year is decisive for this process, and we believe that Turkey should not miss this opportunity.
A revised accession partnership, which was accepted in February of this year, defines the main fields of priority, in which the country should accelerate its reforms.
Of course, it is the actual progress of these reforms that will directly influence the further course of the negotiation process.
I would also like to emphasise that we share the European Parliament's concerns about the proceedings against the Justice and Development Party (AKP).
The Presidency issued a statement emphasising that separation of executive and judicial branches is a fundamental principle of all democratic societies, and this principle must be respected.
We shall carefully monitor the developments.
We hope that the outcome of the proceedings will comply with democratic standards, operating under the principles of the rule of law, and we hope that the process of reforms required will not be affected by these proceedings.
Allow me to continue by mentioning some aspects of affirmation of basic freedoms and the respect of human rights.
These are the areas where the reforms in Turkey are especially important.
In connection with the freedom of expression, we welcome the amendment of Article 301 of the Penal Code.
It is a move in the right direction; however, in order to actually ensure freedom of expression it will be necessary for this article also to be adequately implemented.
Apart from that some other provisions also need to be harmonised with the European standards.
As regards freedom of religion, we welcome the adoption of the Law on Foundations, which is a move in the right direction.
At the same time we emphasise that further efforts must be made in this area towards securing religious pluralism, in line with European criteria.
As regards civilian-military relations, the outcome of the last year's constitutional crisis confirmed that the democratic process is of key importance.
Nonetheless, the armed forces still have significant political influence.
In this respect it is necessary to strengthen civilian democratic control over the military, and to additionally strengthen the Parliament's control over defence spending.
As regards the situation in the South-East of the country, we resolutely condemn the terrorist attacks, and express our solidarity with the Turkish people.
We support Turkey's efforts to protect its population and its fight against terrorism.
However, at the same time we would warn that it is absolutely necessary to respect the provisions of international law, and to endeavour to preserve peace and stability in the wider region.
As it you all know, the European Union evaluates Turkey's progress on the basis of its fulfilment of the Copenhagen political criteria and its compliance with the provisions of the negotiations framework for Turkey.
The Council will also be assessing the implementation of the additional protocol to the Ankara Treaty.
In this connection I regret that Turkey has still not fulfilled its obligations, and no progress has been made towards the normalisation of relations with the Republic of Cyprus.
However, amongst the important aspects of progress in the accession negotiations are, without any doubt, endeavours towards good relations with neighbours and a peaceful resolution of disputes, in line with the constitutional document of the United Nations.
Thank you.
<D>
(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, the Arctic is the only part of the world that is not yet governed by any multilateral rules and regulations.
However, interest in this area and its geopolitical as well as strategic importance have recently been growing on a surprising scale.
Maritime traffic in the Arctic, both commercial and tourist, is on rising.
Interest in its mineral wealth is increasing.
Climate change has a negative impact on the native population's way of life and on biodiversity.
For all these reasons the Arctic should be the discussed at international level with a view to the conclusion of a treaty on the protection of the Arctic, similar to the Madrid Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty of 1993.
Three Arctic countries are Member States of the European Union and two further countries are members of the common European Economic Area.
The European Union should therefore be a key player in future international negotiations concerning the Arctic.
As we have heard, the European Commission is currently working on a communication on its policy regarding the Arctic area.
In our joint motion for a resolution we call on the Commission to consider all of the aspects above.
We also feel that it is crucial to ensure that the Arctic and the Arctic Ocean is an area free of military forces and nuclear weapons, as Mrs Diana Wallis said earlier.
We would also call on the Commission to think about whether it should establish a specialised section for the Arctic area, which would aim at realising these goals and addressing the problems.
<D>
- (SK) I would like to thank the rapporteur.
Bravo, Dagmar, for your work on the draft of the European Parliament and Council regulation presented to us by the Commission.
It is a highly important document for protecting consumer health.
We all no doubt use cosmetic products, as these include not just beauty products but also so-called cosmetics for everyday use, such as toothpaste, deodorants, shampoos, products for the hair and nails, lipstick and so on.
It is now 33 years since the last directive and that is a long enough time, in spite of the amendments.
After all, developments in chemistry and in cosmetics itself have brought enormous and fundamental changes.
I am referring here to the use of nanomaterials, so frequently mentioned here.
These can have both positive and negative effects on human health.
I therefore agree with the opinion that all materials used in cosmetic products which have a carcinogenic effect should be banned.
We should also think very carefully about using materials whose mutagenic and toxic effects cannot be ruled out.
Consumers often purchase cosmetic products on the basis of misleading advertisements or incomplete information so through our European agencies, including now the European Chemicals Agency and the European Office for Food Safety, we must try to draw up the directives and guidelines for monitoring.
We must not forget that cosmetic products are the most frequently counterfeited products and this only increases the likelihood of harmful materials being present.
Besides these warnings we should try to inform consumers of the potential risks to health even from products made by well-known firms.
<D>
- (DE) Mr President, I believe that we now at last have found a text that we can reasonably accept.
However, I regret that a number of coherence problems still exist.
Most of all I regret the actions of those, in particular, who today complained that the display panel was not working.
Four weeks ago we saw in committee how voting ruthlessly went ahead in spite of the fact that 22 languages were not present.
I am therefore particularly opposed to the procedure that we have found.
This all has to do with economic matters and with historical issues, and it also certainly involves energy and probably the environment too.
However, the environment is being paraded like a monstrance and it is indeed remarkable that the European Parliament's Committee on the Environment, which really should have been the first to take action, refused to deliver any opinion at all.
The procedure that we have opted for was not right.
We should have been able to produce a better text.
For this reason - and more especially on procedural grounds and because of the various dealings in the Committee on Petitions - I ultimately did not vote for the report.
<D>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have heard a number of things ...
I shall begin by talking about the debate.
The debate was quite interesting.
I shall not quote anyone, but will say that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has no need for lessons where respect for human rights is concerned.
The PPE-DE Group is happy that Europe is able to reach agreement on common instruments relative to managing migratory flows, as it is also happy that Europe is not turning in on itself.
We have a migratory policy that is both humane and firm; humane because it rejects the disgraceful living conditions of the illegal immigrants who are living in our countries - we are doing all we can to stop men and women boarding boats and risking their lives - and firm because it condemns the traffickers and rogue bosses.
Concerning the Blue Card and the residence permit single procedure, I say to our friend Mr Catania that we need the elite and the others in our countries.
As we are on the subject, the rights of legal immigrants will be the same as those of Community citizens, neither more nor less.
Europe has no need to redeem itself with respect to others insofar as its migratory policies are concerned.
Europe does not consider immigrants as crooks or criminals or as a threat to our security or workforce.
They are men, women and children, flesh and blood, seeking a better life on our territory, because at home they have nothing.
Our common aim is to help and support them, even if this means encouraging them to stay in their countries.
Our migratory policy is dignified, open, perhaps security conscious, but for them, and for us, we can be proud of this policy - as we can take pride tomorrow when voting on these two reports on Europe's migratory policy.
<D>
- (PL) Mr President, I should like to take this opportunity of appealing to the Council to take appropriate action, pursuant to Article 13 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, in order to combat discrimination on the grounds of ethnic origin in Lithuania.
Three politicians from the Polish minority were elected in the recent Lithuanian parliamentary elections.
The Lithuanian authorities subsequently tried to deprive them of their parliamentary seats.
The reason given is that these persons hold the Karta Polaka.
This is a document confirming that the holder belongs to the wider Polish nation.
It is intended to help preserve Polish culture and national identity amongst persons of Polish origin the world over.
The Lithuanian authorities, however, consider that it involves loyalty to a foreign country.
This is obviously ridiculous and outrageous.
In addition, it amounts to discrimination for reasons of ethnic origin, and also involves violating the rights of a national minority, which is behaviour unworthy of a Member State of the European Union.
I trust the Lithuanian authorities will reflect on the matter.
<D>
The European Council's decisions - if you ignore all the rhetoric and demagogy that always accompanies them - lay bare the real objectives and policies of the EU.
Having prevented everyone else from expressing their view in a referendum, they are now imposing a new referendum on those people who sovereignly and democratically rejected this proposed Treaty.
What is more, the Irish people will be confronted with a referendum on the same Treaty (content), accompanied for the time being by a 'political commitment' to be legally fulfilled on the future accession of Croatia in 2010 or 2011.
In this way they are trying to impose a qualitative leap in the neoliberalism, federalism and militarism that this proposed Treaty represents, in the interests of big business and the major powers.
The same European Council is also heading towards a new stage in the militarisation of the EU and international relations, by preparing for the next NATO Summit (in April 2009) and consolidating the EU as its European pillar.
As we have previously stressed, such decisions clearly indicate the antidemocratic nature of the EU, which is inseparable from the position it assumes as an imperialist bloc.
As regards the 'plan to relaunch the European economy', this involves exactly the same policy, as the priority will be to respond to the interests of the major powers and financial capital.
<D>
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, I believe that this is a good example of the proper functioning of the European institutions.
Despite our institutional complexity, the Parliament, the Commission and the Council are all working well on this matter and I hope that, with a satisfactory vote at this Parliamentary session, we can achieve a resolution at first reading, without any further delay.
I am grateful to Mr Frattini for facilitating the outcome and to the rapporteur for all his hard work in arriving at this agreement.
As has been said more than once, the focus of our discussions here has been Article 5, which relates to the protection of consumer rights.
In contractual matters, the consumer is not in a situation of equality; normally he is at a disadvantage.
To give a simple example, take a person who has to sign a car rental contract at an airport: the consumer is not able to read the content of the contract, he is unaware of the law to which the contract is subject and, unless he has legal protection he is completely in the hands of the person offering the contract.
This proposal for a regulation aims, without sacrificing the principles governing choice of the applicable law, to secure a system of protection for the consumer and this is now reflected in the formula - suggested by the Council - whereby the choice of law may not entail for the consumer the loss of the protection provided under the inalienable contractual provisions of the law which, in the absence of choice, would have been applicable under paragraph 1.
Generally speaking, the main problem here in the European Union is the lack of harmonisation of substantive law.
These formulae applying the law of conflict are merely subsidiary formulae and we hope that the Commission will pursue its legislative drive by proposing texts offering the consumer material protection which is uniform throughout the European Union, thereby removing the need to resort to these complicated conflict-of-law provisions.
<D>
Mr President, the Eastern Partnership is a project which covers six countries.
One of them, Belarus, is a dramatic example of self-isolation, to which we have responded in the past with a policy marked by the 'too little, too late' syndrome, both in terms of sanctions and of incentives.
Belarus has little in common with, say, Georgia.
Cooperation between Mr Lukashenko and Mr Saakashvili looks like political fiction and political horror combined.
The other five countries are on the Black Sea, where we have a synergy - which means that there is no strategy yet.
Could the Eastern Partnership stand in for a Black Sea strategy?
One could hardly imagine a regional strategy there without Turkey and Russia, but these particular countries are left out of the process.
What all these countries have in common is the fact that they were all part of the Soviet Union, and they are all neighbours of Russia as much as they are neighbours of the European Union.
In other words, we are dealing with a common neighbourhood.
Russia looks to that neighbourhood as being its reserved sphere of interest.
We certainly cannot accept that but, on the other hand, the Eastern Partnership appears to be a way to reciprocate the Russian policy on its neighbourhood.
This makes that neighbourhood an area of conflicting interests and rivalry.
The real challenge is how to develop an EU-Russia common policy in respect of their common neighbourhood.
Otherwise we will not achieve security and stability there, but the opposite.
As far as everything else is concerned, we already have democracy and good governance, economic integration and convergence, energy security and human contacts on the agenda.
From this point of view, Ukraine is much further advanced than the others, and I assume that it is not very happy to see that our offer now has to be shared with the others.
The real problem was not the lack of labels but the lack of delivery.
By putting our money where our mouth is - and of course, Madam Commissioner, you are perfectly right to say that we need a budget in order to make good policy - and by adding a little visionary realism instead of naive confrontation, we might really transform the Eastern Partnership into a valuable and positive asset.
<D>
(PL) Mr President, it is a rare event indeed for me to say that I agree with everyone who has spoken before me.
You have all explained clearly and convincingly why this year is important.
Mr Janowski explained this particularly eloquently just a few minutes ago.
However, I also agree with those who say that this could be just another of those years that do not have any real results.
Therefore, if we do not want to be saying just that in a year or two, then we must prepare some concrete steps.
One concrete step would be to state that we are realising our fundamental priority, which is the Lisbon strategy.
I have not heard anyone mention this.
This is an incredibly important issue.
It is in the Lisbon strategy that we first linked technological and economic issues with artistic issues.
If we are to speak of specific steps, then I believe we should do this on two levels.
The first level (I am taking advantage of the fact that Commissioner Figel is with us and that he is in charge of schooling and education) is education.
We should analyse the situation in the European Union.
Does the matriculation examination in our secondary schools really provide a basis for creative thinking in the young people taking this examination?
There has to be a real review of what is happening in Europe.
Aesthetic sensitivity on the one hand, and, on the other, mathematical abilities and science - this is what we are lacking.
Traditional humanities do not make this possible.
The European University Association often speaks of this issue.
One last issue, which is very important.
If we are to speak of resources, there is talk of allocating some resources on the level of the European Union.
We have to try to create a situation where, at the end of this year, we have some report, some specific data, on the situation in individual Member States, what is missing, how can we make comparisons, because we have never made this type of comparison on the European level, not properly.
This will help us with the Lisbon strategy.
<D>
Mr President, it is difficult to single out any one thing from these two excellent reports, but I wish to express particular thanks to Mr Guellec for the extent to which his report addresses the issue of disparities within regions.
For, even in those that can be classified as relatively prosperous overall, there may still be certain groups that are disadvantaged or excluded.
This may be a matter of their territorial location.
Inhabitants of islands and mountainous and scarcely-populated border and peripheral areas can be cases in point.
So, too, can fisheries-dependent communities, particularly when they are to be found in areas of the kind just mentioned.
Which is why I, too, very much hope that Parliament will approve Amendments 19 and 20, which seek to reinforce their position.
But disadvantage and exclusion may be at a more distinctly social level.
I am thinking of a project back home in Aberdeenshire called Can-Do.
It has provided occupation for people with learning difficulties, in sorting cans and bottles for recycling.
It lost eligibility for European support when funding for the current period was relocated to parts of the country where deprivation is more widespread.
But the people concerned remain just as much at risk of social exclusion as before.
Both examples show that, if we are to target funding at those most in need, we need to develop a more sophisticated approach to quantifying that need.
I ask the Commission to pay particular attention to the call in the report for improved statistical tools to allow more accurate measurement of the extent of cohesion and better assessment of the contributions of local actions aimed at achieving it.
Such tools would also allow us to pinpoint actual cases of disadvantage and decide how they can best be addressed.
<D>
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. - (NL) I would like to thank the Members for their extremely pleasant cooperation on this report.
I think, however, that it must have taken a great deal of time to achieve this proposal.
I find, sadly, that in some matters it does not go far enough.
It is very important, in my opinion, to create guidelines to which sporting organisations can commit themselves.
When it comes to State support, we should aim for the same treatment throughout Europe, particularly where professional sporting organisations are concerned.
I also find that the distinction between the specific characteristics of sport and the economic activities that frequently accompany sport is a little too explicit, because I believe that economic activities - including those that protect sport - cannot have exceptions made for them in the Treaty.
That is fortunately also not mentioned in this report.
That is also the reason why I wholeheartedly support it.
I think it is good that sporting organisations have started talking more than they did formerly about this subject, and that is a significant step forward.
Thank you very much.
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, I am no pacifist - anybody in this Chamber who knows me well would say that - but there is much about warfare and the arms trade which we must regret.
Cluster munitions to me are one of the most horrible ways of waging war which should always, of course, only occur as a very last resort.
There is much evidence to suggest that these weapons disproportionately affect civilian populations, who must be protected above all in international law.
Cluster bombs can fall across a huge area and remain unexploded for very long periods of time, posing a lethal threat to civilians who could be killed or maimed long after a conflict has ended.
They are also costly to locate and remove and cannot be formally mapped in the same way that a minefield can.
Sometimes children have picked these things up, thinking of them as toys, and losing limbs or perhaps even their lives as a result.
As a father of very young children myself, few things could be more horrendous to think about.
If we are serious about creating a European Union of common values and sharing those values with the world, we must take a common position to promote an eventual ban on these terrifying and terrible arms, which are very blunt in their effect on the battlefield.
We must also use all diplomatic means at our disposal to persuade others to do the same.
We, as the European Parliament, can rightly be proud of what we have done to try to rid the world of the scourge of anti-personnel land mines.
We must approach this issue of cluster bombs with equal vigour and commitment, in order to build a better, more humane world and not see innocent civilians suffer in the aftermath of armed conflict.
<D>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission very much welcomes this report.
However important subcontracting may be for increasing productivity and competitiveness, we fully recognise the need for effective measures to ensure that it neither encourages nor facilitates non-compliance with employment conditions, particularly where there are long subcontracting chains.
Adequate, effective, deterrent penalties are needed to ensure that subcontractors meet their legal and contractual obligations in full, in particular in relation to workers' rights.
Greater transparency in the subcontracting process will lead to greater overall protection of workers' rights, an issue to which the Commission is - and will remain - very attached, as you know.
Whilst I might approve of your general principle, according to which European problems require European solutions, I would be more prudent in relation to the conclusion set out in paragraph 14 of the report, which says that the problem can only be resolved by introducing a clear-cut legal instrument that introduces joint and several liability at European level.
The report also seems to go in this direction in paragraph 15, where it calls for an impact assessment on the added value and feasibility of such a Community instrument.
As regards the call for the Commission to guarantee effective compliance with the directive on the posting of workers, made in paragraph 25, I would like to point out that we have recently set up a high-level working party on the posting of workers.
This working party consists of representatives from the Member States and the social partners and is aimed at improving the practical application of the directive and, in particular, administrative cooperation among Member States.
It will hold its first meeting on 25 March.
In this regard, I would like to mention a study entitled 'Liability in subcontracting processes in the European construction sector', published in 2008 by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, which highlights both the major differences between the national joint liability systems and their level of effectiveness.
This study also highlighted the fact that there would appear to be no universal solution and recommended further debate and research, particularly in relation to cross-border issues.
The problem that we are trying to solve is of a social nature, but the solution proposed clearly has implications that go well beyond the social domain.
We therefore need to study its economic and legal repercussions in detail.
I fully agree that this problem deserves more complete research and that, before presenting draft legislation, we must study carefully various non-regulatory methods for dealing with some of the issues raised in the report, in other words: improved cooperation and coordination among national authorities, inspection and other national enforcement authorities; an awareness of good practice within companies; current guidelines and standards; initiatives on social responsibility; and transnational company agreements, into which are already built innovative provisions relating to risk assessment procedures and the supervision of subcontractors.
<D>
- (PL) Madam President, in a few months' time we shall once again turn to the citizens of the European Union and ask them to choose their representatives at the European Parliament.
Once again, the citizens will not understand why they are being called on to do so, or what purpose this Parliament serves.
Once again, therefore, the turnout at the elections will be low.
Today's debate on the Posting of Workers Directive and the ruling by the European Court of Justice demonstrates that one of the purposes the European Parliament serves is to protect the citizens against certain policies advocated by their own governments.
These policies can be short-sighted and biased.
In this case they are also unduly liberal.
Currently, the European Parliament and the European Court of Justice are giving priority to defending labour rights over defending the freedom of entrepreneurship.
It is impossible to oppose the principle of equal treatment for workers across the entire Union.
We all have to pay the same prices in the shops and we call for equal pay for equal work across the entire Union.
<D>
(EL) Mr President, let us pay tribute to the memory of Nikos Aslamazidis, of the Saint-Nazaire dockyard, who went on hunger strike.
We must once again raise the issue of protecting workers from modern-day slave trading.
Let us talk about unemployment, under-employment, and job insecurity, and also about agencies which hire out workers, or, perhaps I should say, exploit them.
These employment agencies treat workers like modern-day slaves: they use them until they are worn out, pay them peanuts, move them around at will and arbitrarily get rid of them.
How are we protecting the workers?
The Bolkestein Directive makes ambiguity an art form and allows them to be thrown onto the social slag heap.
The increasingly popular flexicurity policy is a new way of deregulating employment relations resulting in less stable employment and greater insecurity job.
As a result, we now have disposable workers, who struggle daily to survive with dignity.
The creation of different kind of Europe whose priorities are full employment, improved working conditions and a fairer redistribution of wealth, is not only feasible but imperative.
The sacrifices of the workers are essentially a struggle against the new imposition of medieval terms of employment against which all progressive forces must really fight as one.
<D>
- (HU) I welcome the decision of the Council with regard to the position to be put forward at the G20 summit.
I am pleased that our political leaders have recognised that measures to address the global crisis and the fight against climate change are closely related.
The essence of the 'Green New Deal' development plan put forward by Prime Minister Gordon Brown and President Barack Obama is to link economic stimulus with environmental investments and with support for increased energy efficiency and environmentally friendly technologies.
I do not, however, share the Council's view that progress in the implementation of the European economic stimulus programme accepted last December is satisfactory.
Although it will be some time before its positive effects on the economy are felt, there is no doubt that the large-scale budgetary package, representing 3.3% of the EU's GDP - that is, more than EUR 400 billion - will generate new investments and create jobs.
However, the programme made only a very small contribution to transforming the EU into a low carbon dioxide-emitting economy.
Although we speak emphatically of improving energy efficiency and energy savings, yet more attention and funds are directed to the energy providers, to diversifying supply routes and to promoting the EU's energy interests vis-à-vis third countries.
Undoubtedly we need to develop the energy infrastructure, but not at the expense of reducing consumption.
The European Union continues to be committed to playing a leading role in the Copenhagen global climate agreement.
In order to do so, however, we urgently need to agree on the development of a global carbon dioxide market, on financial compensation for developing countries, on technological support and on capacity building, as well as clarifying at last the principles of burden-sharing among Member States.

Vice-President of the Commission. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in fact, in 1988 the Commission proposed a directive on the maximum rate of blood-alcohol permitted for drivers, but in the absence of an agreement between the Member States and the Commission, the Commission had to content itself with adopting, on 17 January 2001, a recommendation that a maximum rate of 0.5 mg/ml be imposed in all the Member States.
Today, in the European Union, only three Member States, Ireland, Malta and the United Kingdom, have maximum rates of blood alcohol greater than that value.
The recommendation of the Commission also envisaged lowering the blood-alcohol rate to 0.2 mg/ml for certain categories of driver, including learners, who are the subject of the first question posed by the honourable Member.
In fact, learner drivers are the main victims of danger on the roads and therefore it is vital to reduce as far as possible the risk factors in relation to them, for instance, by permitting for this category a blood-alcohol rate no greater, as I have said, than 0.2 mg/ml.
This is linked to the measure known as 'zero rate', laid down for this category of driver in the communication adopted by the Commission in October 2006 and which lays down a strategy to support the Member States to reduce the damage caused by alcohol.
Ladies and gentlemen, given this background, the Commission unfortunately does not consider that the political conditions are in place that would allow the adoption by the Member States of a piece of legislation designed to further harmonise the level of blood-alcohol permitted within the EU.
Having said that, the Commission does not intend to remain inactive with regard to something which remains one of the main causes of deaths on Europe's roads.
The Commission has taken various measures on this issue.
First and foremost, with regard to road checks, in the recommendation of 6 April 2004, the Commission pushed to intensify random checks on blood-alcohol levels through an effective device to measure alcohol in blood through an analysis of exhaled air, to be used in those places and at the times in which excessive consumption of alcohol by drivers is regularly observed.
Ladies and gentlemen, I must also stress that driving under the influence of alcohol is one of the offences covered by the proposal for a directive facilitating cross-border enforcement in the field of road safety, adopted by the Commission in March of this year, and currently being debated by the Council and Parliament.
At the last Transport Council, I was able to emphasise this to the ministers: faced with the loss of human lives, we cannot stalemate ourselves with legal quibbles or discuss whether it is an issue relating to the first or third pillar because unfortunately, legal debates serve for very little in tackling and resolving problems as serious as road accidents.
I would like to take the opportunity of this parliamentary debate to point out that the four offences envisaged in the directive under discussion which, in addition to driving while drunk, are speeding, not wearing seatbelts and driving after having taken narcotic substances, are responsible for three out of four road accidents.
This means that much can and must be done by the European Union, and I therefore call once again upon Parliament to go forward in the direction already embarked upon through the vote in the Committee on Transport and Tourism.
Additionally I am just about to finish, Mr President, in order to be able to draw up in the near future concrete proposals regarding driving under the influence of psychoactive substances, in October 2006 the Commission launched a research project set to last for four years designed to improve knowledge in this field and formulate solutions.
This is the DRUID project, of which you are well aware.
Finally, the financial support supplied by the Commission for awareness-raising campaigns should be stressed.
These are, in particular, those campaigns conducted by young people aimed at other young people to make them aware of the danger of consuming alcohol and drugs when driving a car.
One example of many is the campaign called 'Bob' which was very successful throughout Europe, and we should also remember the commitment of the Commission, which called Kimi Raikkonen, outgoing world Formula One champion, to Brussels to be a witness for the European Union's campaign for road safety, as well as the day dedicated to road safety in large cities which was held in Paris on 10 October, and which is a further indication of the European Commission's huge commitment on road safety.
I made this one of my priorities during the debate on confidence following my appointment as European Commissioner for transport.
Ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately more cannot be done, but I hope that I have been comprehensive in answering your oral question.
<D>
(LT) I support Mr Zalewski's position, to be precise, Amendment No 1, since it draws serious attention to two questions that are crucial for the European Union.
Firstly, we do not approve of the way the third country arrogantly ignores and rejects the EU as its equal and respected partner in matters of external energy security that are important to the European Union.
Secondly, we do not approve of the anti-European dividing line, which of course, the third country is implementing in the 'Nord Stream' gas pipeline project.
We must oppose the lobbyist and, at times, corrupt division of Europe, and must not condone Russia's arrogance towards us, by which I mean the European Parliament.
We cannot allow Gazprom - the principal 'Nord Stream' shareholder - to completely ignore our Parliament's resolution on the threats the gas pipeline poses to the environment.
The problem is not simply the tragic ecological state of the Baltic Sea, but also our institution's moral condition.
When we voted here last year, we demanded that an evaluation of the impact on the environment be carried out, one that is independent and not bought in advance, and that guarantees be given to nations on the shores of the Baltic should there be a disaster.
Gazprom did not even bother to answer Europe.
That is like spitting in Parliament's face and we cannot respond by saying 'Yes, sir, great pleasure'.
We must behave with dignity and honour without manipulating or blocking the special debates currently initiated by MEPs on problems concerning Baltic Sea life.
If, struck by fear, we agree to the murdering of the Baltic and a new Moscow-Berlin border in the sea with Russian Naval vessels protecting the pipeline, we will bury our free future.
Indeed, while chatting about energy, we are selling our future.
<D>
Madam President, the European Council has decided to double the 'balance of payments' facility for countries outside the euro zone, and on 8 April the Commission introduced the concrete provisions designed to turn this proposal into a reality.
Here at the European Parliament we wish to accept our responsibilities and to enable the Ecofin Council to act promptly for, as we see it, this proposal contains a sign of solidarity towards non-member countries of the euro zone that is of vital importance for tackling the root of this crisis.
Back in November, we were already doubling this 'balance of payments' facility, since it rose from EUR 12 to 25 billion, and, today, to take account not only of the reality, the severity of the crisis that we are in and that is having a particular impact on countries outside the euro zone, but also, without doubt, of the European Parliament's timetable, we propose to you that this facility be doubled, to bring it up to EUR 50 billion.
This is in light of the fact that what we decided in November has already enabled support to be given to Hungary, to Latvia and, yesterday, to Romania.
We feel that this is necessary, and we have held a debate among ourselves, which I will not hide from you, to learn whether this assessment of countries outside the euro zone should be done exclusively on a case-by-case basis, or whether, in reality, there was basically a more global situation that was that of countries outside the euro zone.
That is why, in our resolution, we propose that the issue of enlargement conditions be considered and the extent to which membership of the zone can be a protective factor be confirmed.
We are also very insistent in calling for the European Parliament to be informed of the substance of the analyses of the crisis situations these countries are facing.
This is because, when the Commission grants its loans to countries outside the euro zone, there is a certain transparency and substance to the information on the behaviour of private banks and on the behaviour of operators which has led to this crisis, that the European Parliament must be informed of.
Lastly, we believe that all possible mechanisms for tackling this crisis should be used and implemented by the Commission.
This is particularly the case as regards Article 100 of the Treaty, which would also permit the implementation of special mechanisms for countries within the euro zone.
We believe it is essential to explore these given the severity of the crisis.
There are two final elements.
Firstly, as we see it, the conditionality of these loans is an element for discussion; we understand that.
Generally speaking, the Commission carries out this work in harmony with the IMF.
What we want is the creation of a working group to look at how these memorandums are drawn up and how they take account of the actual situation of the country in question, but also of the European Union's overall strategy, particularly as regards arbitrage between investments, purchasing power support and conditionality in terms of a strategy on environmental growth and sustainable development.
Lastly, we identify in this mechanism evidence of the ability of the European Union and of the Commission to borrow on the international markets, and we therefore believe that we have here a useful foundation on which to base a debate that we are also conducting on European borrowing and on the capacity of the European Union to finance future strategies and investments through such borrowing.
To conclude, the Commission has implemented a new mechanism to ensure that repayments will enable the European Union's budget to cope with these demands.
We support this amendment to the regulation and we hope that this Parliament will give its full support to this worthwhile proposal.
<D>
Two weeks ago, I had the opportunity to visit the people of Burma and the border between Thailand and Burma.
There I saw with my own eyes the injustice with which we treat some parts of the world in political and media terms.
All too often, we are only moved by headline news.
What we have seen in Burma, which is now no longer on the front pages, is a drama that is not so different from what has mobilised us in many other cases.
We have very clear examples of persecution, torture, illegal detention, rape and other atrocities committed by the Burmese military junta.
One of the most shameful recent actions has been the adoption of a so-called constitution that violates the most basic democratic principles and guarantees almost complete impunity for all the acts I have just mentioned.
It is quite understandable that people flee from this situation, as the Karen population has been doing for several years and, as we are today reporting in the resolution, the Rohingya people has also done, being intercepted in Thailand.
In this respect, I noted during my visit that both Thailand and the international community have assumed a disturbing attitude of submission to the junta.
For example, many lawyers associations, opposition parties, refugees and political prisoners have alerted us to the terrible consequences that would befall the Burmese people if the international community and, in particular, the European Union were to support and endorse the sham elections that have been called by the SPDC for 2010.
They warn us that this would give carte blanche to the junta to continue committing a wide range of crimes with impunity.
The political and ethnic groups that oppose the junta are very well organised and have drawn up an alternative constitution that is much more in line with the principles that we say we defend in the European Union.
Therefore, for us to abandon them to their fate would be a mistake and would make us accomplices, whether active or passive, to the Burmese dictatorship.
<D>
Madam President, I have a few observations.
I do not trust the Commission; I do not trust unelected bureaucrats behind the scenes who have meetings for which I do not have any minutes.
I do not trust this place, which gives a veneer of democracy, but which is largely made up of placemen.
This looks to me like political editorial control over things on the Internet - the new medium.
It is the sort of thing we condemn when it happens in China.
I do not like it.
It smells a bit to me.
I do not know what is going on behind the scenes, as the previous speaker just said, and what deals are being done that we do not know about.
We have perfectly good copyright laws.
We have perfectly good data protection laws.
That should be enough.
I do not want any more control coming to this sinister and corrupt institution.
<D>
Rapporteur for opinion of the IMCO Committee. - (RO) Mrs. President, dear colleagues, Mrs. Commissioner, dear Ministers, I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs involved in the work with the Telecom package.
I think Mrs. Trautmann's report represents a balanced position and I support the compromise amendments proposed.
I am also glad that certain amendments were accepted, in particular those regarding the harmonization of the spectrum, as well as certain measures related to the global telecommunication services.
The European economic growth, as well as the consumer welfare, depends on a dynamic and competitive telecommunication sector.
Competitive markets have broadband available, the new comers on the market have brought increased speed and innovating services.
The framework directive in the telecommunication package should focus on increasing investments; we also have to take into account next-generation networks and consumer options have to be more diversified, leading to lower costs and better services to their advantage.
In conclusion, I would like to express my confidence in the changes we intend to bring to the Telecom package, which shall be to the benefit of consumers, providing them with a broad range, lower costs and more diversified services.
<D>
(LT) The main lesson of the gas crisis is the great vulnerability of Europe's energy system and the very significant risk to supply delivery.
This risk remains as the agreement between Ukraine and Russia is a one-time agreement and the situation will undoubtedly be repeated.
Bilateral energy questions remain fundamentally unresolved, not just between Russia and Ukraine, but between Ukraine and the European Union and between the European Union and Russia, all the more so because there is no common EU-Ukraine-Russia energy operating system.
There have so far been neither safeguards nor guarantees and these have yet to appear.
I would like to stress that dependence on the supply of gas and on the use of gas is increasing dramatically and will grow even more once the power stations in Lithuania, Bulgaria and Slovakia have been closed.
This shows that the risk remains and is perhaps increasing.
We have a very clear long-term energy strategy for the whole of the European Union.
We have had very heated debates about it.
There is talk of long-term measures.
In my view, the weakest link is our short- to medium-term energy policy.
It has not passed the reality test and this was demonstrated by the gas crisis.
I would invite the Commission to investigate such a scenario which, unfortunately, was not investigated for various other legal and political reasons.
What would be the cost, benefit and consequences of temporarily prolonging nuclear power operations in Bulgaria, Slovakia and Lithuania, thereby fundamentally strengthening the energy security of both these countries and the whole of Europe in this situation?
In addition, faced with the conditions of a long-term and undefined economic crisis, this would allow resources to be used more efficiently and would greatly reduce the burden of the crisis on our residents and the business sector.
<D>
(FR) Madam President, I would like first to thank Mrs Reding, our Commissioner, the French Presidency, which in December came to a very intelligent common position, and then the Czech Presidency, which has just achieved its aim.
I would also like to thank and congratulate above all our three rapporteurs, Mr Harbour, Mrs Trautmann and Mrs del Castillo Vera, who have done a magnificent job.
The package that we are voting on today includes provisions that go absolutely in the direction one would wish for the development of the telecommunications market, in an orderly fashion and for the benefit of everybody: a European regulation entrusted to a Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC) with mixed financing, without a veto; a balance between competition and the need for new investment - functional separation is limited to exceptional cases; a desire to focus attention on public services in spectrum management; new services; new freedom of access; and, thanks to Mr Harbour in particular, a considerable increase in the rights of consumers.
I am just sorry that 'must carry' has been rejected.
For France, this text is perfectly balanced, it is a good compromise, and here I mean that, with regard to those infamous controversial amendments, what has been proposed in the end is intelligent, in my opinion, because it makes it possible to implement intellectual property rights on the Internet without compromising freedom of access to the latter.
The Internet must apply the law in this field as in others.
The virtual world is not a lawless world and it must not submit only to the power of advertising brought in by operators and Internet access providers.
That is why I share Mrs Trautmann's point of view.
The compromise puts the rights of employees, of artists and of Internet users on an equal footing, and that is a good thing.
<D>
The Europe 2020 strategy, the recognised successor of the so-called Lisbon Strategy, must start by making an appropriate assessment of the methods of its predecessor.
If this were done, it would find that the approaches which it implemented - namely, the liberalisation of important economic sectors and the deregulation and increased flexibility of labour laws - have been the causes of its results in practice: increased unemployment, insecurity, poverty and social exclusion and economic stagnation and recession.
The Commission and Parliament now seek to follow the same approaches.
The proposed path is clear and neither the social or environmental rhetoric which it tries to set out are enough to disguise the following: total emphasis on the Single Market, pursuit of liberalisation, commercialisation of more and more aspects of social life, lack of job security, and structural unemployment.
The consensus which exists between the Right and Social Democrats regarding these approaches has been made quite clear.
In the final analysis, they have together been its faithful protagonists in recent years.
This strategy, essentially, is nothing more than the response of two tendencies within a single system to the structural crisis of that system.
In following this approach, the strategy will itself be the origin of new and deeper crises.
In following this approach, the strategy will inevitably face resistance and be fought by the workers and the people.
<D>
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (SK) Colleagues, imagine that there was no tax evasion in the European Union.
If the funds acquired in this way were distributed fairly, every citizen of the European Union, including children and pensioners, would have EUR 500 more in their wallet every year.
No country can combat tax evasion effectively on its own.
International cooperation is imperative, especially in the VAT area, where the monitoring of intra-Community transactions is complicated by the current system.
One solution with a long-term positive effect in combating tax evasion would be the creation of a VAT system under which transactions between Member States would be taxed at a rate other than zero.
The zero-rate tax on exports of goods is being abused by fraudsters and criminal groups that, for example, create fictitious transactions and fraudulently drain billions of euros from state budgets.
The current long deadlines for the submission of tax returns also provide room for the commission of such tax frauds.
The report on the draft directive that we are discussing now represents an acceleration of the exchange of information necessary for the fight against tax fraud.
That is one of the reasons we are shortening the deadline for the submission of tax returns for intra-Community transactions.
The VAT system created in 1993 is only transitional.
I believe that at the beginning of the next term of office, the Commission will present more ambitious measures dealing with final and comprehensive VAT reform.
The provisional nature of the current system is one of the reasons why in my amendment, which was approved by the Committee, I request that the Commission evaluate the impact of the adopted measures three years earlier than was proposed in the original amendment proposal.
This is to avoid a situation where the system would be evaluated at a time when it is no longer in force.
To conclude, I wish to thank and congratulate the rapporteur on a well-balanced report.
The draft allows for an early response to tax fraud.
It is also positive that business people themselves have stated that the administrative burden will be minimal.
<D>
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. - (SV) Mr President, the conditions for small businesses today are crucial for the growth of tomorrow's jobs.
They are vital for our ability to emerge from this crisis into a better and more highly skilled and competitive economy.
It is the small businesses that drive innovation forward, but it is also the small businesses that currently have the greatest credit problems in the various Member States and in the Union as such.
What we are intending to do here with the Statute for a European private company - and I would like to thank the Commission for the proposal and the rapporteur for her work - is to open up the internal market for small businesses to the same extent as for large companies.
It is in this regard that new ground needs to be broken.
As we discussed in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, it is a matter of carrying out a thorough simplification of the rules, which will open up doors for small businesses.
It is about ensuring that small businesses can be involved in public procurement to the same extent as large companies as a result of the way that public procurement is carried out.
It is about making it easier for small businesses to operate across borders, including with regard to matters such as paying VAT, and about combating the bureaucracy that is currently proving prohibitive.
It is also about providing European financial markets with better conditions for expansion and growth by providing a better credit market for small businesses through the efforts of the European Investment Bank and others.
Finally, I would like to say that
Small is beautiful.
Small will be bigger tomorrow and give new jobs and more prosperity.
<D>
(EL) Mr President, I, too, should like to welcome Commissioner Damanaki and, in particular, to thank Mrs Maria do Céu Patrão Neves for her exhaustive and exceptional work.
All the important things have already been said.
I shall turn my attention to three points: firstly, overfishing.
Overfishing is an undisputed fact.
In fact, as Mr Arsenis said, it is currently estimated that 88% of stocks in European seas are threatened by overfishing, meaning that they are being fished at a level which prevents their recovery.
Chronic overfishing has resulted in smaller and smaller catches for European fisheries and lost jobs.
Smaller and smaller fish are being caught, often before they reach reproductive age, and they are becoming more and more difficult to locate.
Secondly, Europe catches far fewer fish today than it did 15 years ago, approximately 25% less, while fishing effort and the cost of fishing have risen.
However, when taking measures, we must not overreact, as this may bring about adverse results, given that, according to the specialists, although we have overfishing, we are not talking about collapsing stocks.
What we must not forget is that viability has three dimensions, which are also highlighted in the Neves report: the social dimension, the economic dimension and the ecological dimension.
A fisheries policy which targets viable development must not revolve solely around fish; it must also focus on man.
Fish, man, cormorants and seals are competing systems in the same ecological environment.
Finally, I must emphasise that I, like numerous other fellow Members, are insisting on more research into fisheries.
It is not my insistence; it is a reality which we must address within the framework of everything said by Mr Cadec.
<D>
(FR) Mr President, I would simply like to add that I have just returned from a four-day visit to Poland.
I had a good look around and I talked to Polish people, and I am pleased to report that I did not meet any who took the same tone as our colleague here.
I found the Poles to be thoroughly European.
I also laid a wreath at Auschwitz-Birkenau: I believe that people from every country in Europe have been there and I believe that all of us - including yourself, most particularly, Mr President - are determined such things will never happen again!
So I am pleased to say that what we have just heard was not the voice of Poland, nor of the ordinary Polish citizen; it was the voice of dangerous people, whose dangerous thinking would be capable of taking us back to the days of concentration camps.
I will not mince my words here.
Never again!
And, above all, let us never again hear this sort of hatred expressed in the European Parliament!
(Applause)
<D>
Mr President, it is difficult not to feel very uneasy about the responsibilities taken on by the European Union and its Member States in the Kosovo affair.
Firstly, in principle the EU aims to contribute to better world governance.
Yet under its impetus, several Member States have weakened or are about to weaken dangerously the future credibility of international law through their support for the unilateral declaration of independence by a province of a sovereign state, a member of the UN.
Whatever is said about the sui generis - because that is not decreed - the EU's major powers thus place power relations above the law, and in doing so open a Pandora's box.
This is serious.
Next, this unilateral recognition is in serious danger of going against the EU's stated objectives in the Balkans.
It will fuel nationalism rather than stemming its sources.
Furthermore, the EU has just deeply alienated the Serbian people, without whom any regional policy in that part of Europe is impossible.
As it happens I am not talking about those who would like to have Milošević back, but those who opposed him and are now in the majority.
As for the Kosovo Albanians themselves, will the EU be able to satisfy their expectations after fuelling them?
It is a question worth asking, hence the third reason for the unease felt after this day of jubilation in Kosovo.
The new challenge the European Union has just given itself is quite breathtaking.
Here we are in the front line, heading towards a new protectorate, even though no satisfactory analysis has been produced of the reasons for the failure of the previous protectorate: Kosovo's gross domestic product is equivalent to that of Rwanda, half of its active population is unemployed, there are more than 200 000 refugees and displaced people, and violence against minorities is on the increase, despite EUR 2 billion of international aid and the presence of 17 000 NATO troops.
It will not be EULEX that sorts out all these problems.
What comprehensive lasting prospect is the European Union able to offer to the Kosovars and to the other peoples of the Balkans - a prospect that can stabilise the situation here without the risk of destabilising it elsewhere?
Membership?
Within what timescale?
Under what conditions?
With what degree of probability that the necessary unanimous agreement of the 27 Member States will be secured?
Nobody knows.
Clearly, my group cannot associate itself with the short-term self-satisfaction of the principal European leaders.
(Applause)
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Trust can never be commanded, it has to be deserved and earned.
We can only try to improve the trust between Member States by having a more vigorous governance over Schengen; to make sure that we evaluate, not by the peer-review system we have today, but through an independent mechanism on a European communitarian basis with the involvement of the European Union in order to identify problems or weaknesses in the Schengen system very early on and also make sure that we have tools at our disposal to immediately assist Member States that are in difficulty.
Hopefully, that should allow us to increase the trust.
In answer to the other honourable Member, we are now negotiating the framework, so I am not in a position to give you any figures.
However, as we do today, we are seeking to increase the independence and the resources of Frontex.
We are also seeking to facilitate Member States' access to the various funds under migration by simplifying and by making it easier when it comes to borders, asylum, integration, etc.
Of course we need to distinguish between irregular migrants and migrants in need of international protection.
As you know, the Council and Parliament are now negotiating to have the resettlement programme in place, and this is also an area where the European Commission could look at possibilities for financing quite a lot of it.
In relation to our immediate neighbourhood across the Mediterranean, in the mobility partnerships: we are looking to include all aspects of irregular, legal and international protection asylum under migration.
All this demands a lot of political will and some extra resources, and I will do my best to fight to make sure that there are resources under my responsibility.
Part two
Subject: Visa scheme for Kosovo
What is the Commission's assessment of the current state of progress towards visa liberalisation for Kosovo (visa facilitation scheme), and what is the timetable for action on this urgent matter?
<D>
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in your speech today, Commissioner, you mentioned the contribution made by the cohesion policy to climate protection.
I welcome this change of heart, because there is no emphasis on this in the Green Paper on territorial cohesion.
Why not, given the climate crisis that we are currently facing?
The contribution of the European Structural Funds to environmental transformation is a future issue for territorial cohesion.
The 'Regions 2020' document produced by the Commission shows that climate change has had a massive impact on many of Europe's regions.
As a result, we must change course.
The Structural Funds should be used only to support sustainable projects.
Projects and programmes which cause damage to the climate, and many of these have been approved in the past, should no longer be authorised.
EU funds should not be used to promote programmes and projects which damage the climate.
Why are you not taking this approach already?
The second question concerns the implementation of the partnership principle.
Commissioner, you mentioned that local knowledge is an important foundation for successful development.
Why have you nevertheless approved operational programmes where the partnership principle is clearly being completely disregarded and where the partners have reported that they were not involved?
You have not answered this question.
Local, grass-roots knowledge is an asset for us.
If you continue to attempt to ignore the fact that Member States are completely disregarding the partnership principle and to provide them with subsidies despite this, you will be breaching the Structural Funds Regulation.
You completely fail to mention in your report, which forms the basis for the Mikolášik report, that many Member States have not followed the partnership principle.
You have not taken the partners' reports into account.
Why do you remain silent on this subject?
It is clear at this point that we need a new dimension for the Structural Funds.
They must be based on environmental and democratic principles, make use of local knowledge and follow the partnership principle.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I am impressed by honourable Members' involvement with this dossier and I have paid great attention to all the remarks made this evening.
I want to do my utmost to give you an answer and, if you will allow me, I shall take a little time and try to explain what the reality is at the moment.
Mr Buzek started by giving an explanation of the situation in Poland, and he rightly mentioned that we should be prepared to offer a positive solution to maintain business activities.
We are offering a positive solution to maintain business activities.
If investors are interested in shipbuilding, as some say they are - and we got that message not only from one member of the government but also from different sides - then they can bid for the assets, and that is what I was underlining.
Please take into account that, as far as the Commission is concerned, the solution could result in viable economic activities in Poland.
We have to talk about viable economic activities, because I do not want to present the workers who are involved with something that is not viable.
It has taken too much time.
All those people have the right to know what is going on and what their future will be, and no one is expecting that we will just say: let us go on, what the hell, what can we do now, let us just continue with what we have been doing.
We are aware that this is not a viable situation any more.
Having said that, we, the Commission, did our utmost to come up with a solution.
Therefore, as I said earlier, firstly, for Gdańsk, the Polish Government should offer us a business plan in which there is a viable future.
All the craftsmen there can do an extremely good job and are already doing a job which there is good reason to think could be expanded - after all, it is privatised, the owners have made investments and there is a possibility that this can continue.
However, we badly need a business plan, and that is what I am asking you for.
You who are so involved in the Polish situation should just address your Polish Government and say: 'Come on, boys and girls, now you have to deliver.
We, as Members of the European Parliament, no longer accept the fact that you are not delivering.'
In other words, they are not delivering a solution to the question that you have in mind.
Assuming that the Gdańsk side of the problem is approached in the way I mentioned, then I will now come to the two other shipyards.
I have just described to you that Gdynia and Szczecin could be approached with an employment future that is viable.
That is what we are talking about, and that is why I mentioned the example of Olympic Airways.
Of course, they are completely different: one is shipbuilding and the other is flying.
But, having said that, the original thought behind the Olympic Airways solution was liquidation and then assets, without the burden of paying back all those large amounts of money, and then, with the new investors, giving these undertakings an opportunity to find a viable future.
Mr Schulz, we did not say that the yards should be shut.
We are seeking a way for them to be strong enough to resist the coming recession and with the activities which are most likely to be profitable on those sites, and there lies the opportunity for both of the shipyards, once the assets are bundled, taking into account that there are a couple of potential investors who are interested in just giving them a viable future.
Ms Schroedter, the Polish yards have had a longer transition than the East German yards, and during a booming period of the economy.
Not only Mr Chruszcz, but also Mr Czarnecki, if you are comparing this to the situation in the German shipyards, - and it is right to say that there is a parallel with the German shipyards - then I have two general remarks.
Firstly, we need to realise that the shipbuilding industry in other countries, such as Denmark or the UK, where the public purse was not so generous, was considerably downsized or even closed.
I have some claim to know about this: in my own country quite a number of shipyards had to be closed.
So if we speak about equal treatment, we need to take into account that in other Member States of the European Union there is a history of closing shipyards which can no longer be viable.
A couple of Members made the comparison with the situation in Germany.
The total size of the three shipyards in Poland - Gdynia, Gdańsk and Szczecin - is comparable to the size of the German shipyards prior to their restructuring, and the aid already granted to the Polish shipyards in the period 2002-2008 is also comparable to the aid granted by Germany to its shipyards - around EUR 3 billion.
So there is a basis for comparison.
However, from both the perspective of competition distortion and of safeguarding stable employment, the length of the restructuring process in Poland is an aggravating factor.
Whereas the shipyards in Germany were privatised in 1993 and finalised their restructuring in 1995-1996, the Polish shipyards have continued subsidised operations for a very long time, since well before the Polish accession to the EU, and have been bailed out several times since then.
I have mentioned before that now, in 2008, more than four years have passed since the accession of Poland to the EU, and eight years since the first state aid rules were introduced in Poland in 2000 pursuant to the 1994 Association Agreement.
In addition, the shipbuilding industry has been benefiting from an unprecedented boom over the last five years.
That should also be taken into account: even during a period of a booming sector, it was not possible to put the Polish shipyards in a viable position, so that is something we have to take into account.
Even during that period things were not working properly in a way comparable to the other shipyards.
So if we take into account that the boom, with an assured inflow of orders and ever-increasing prices, created favourable conditions for conducting a far-reaching restructuring in Poland, then that chance has not been utilised by Poland.
Industry experts already forecast a downturn, an overcapacity in the world market in the two or three years to come.
To conclude, the comparison with Germany might be meaningful.
Yes, it is close by; yes, it is nearby a comparable situation.
It shows that the Polish shipyards are treated exactly the same as the German shipyards.
The same criteria are applied when assessing the state aid, with viability being the most prominent of them.
Finally, a parallel should also be drawn with cases where the Commission has not authorised state aid and even ordered recovery of illegal state aid in other Member States.
In the shipbuilding sector I recall negative decisions ordering repayment of aid - as some of you will remember - with regard to the Spanish public shipyard IZAR, to Greek shipyards and a couple of other ones.
If Mr Bielan is saying - as I too said in my remarks - we have taken years, then this is because of the economic, social and symbolic importance of the yards.
Yes, we did.
I dare to defend that, but the best thing we can give to the heroes of the yards is a viable future, and that is what I am asking you for: just a realistic approach, the approach that those heroes deserve.
A question was asked about European shipbuilding.
The Commission, in cooperation with the European shipbuilding industry, is actively implementing an integrated strategy - and we call it 'Leadership 2015' - aimed at increasing the competitiveness of the shipbuilding industry in all the Member States of the European Union.
In that context, work is ongoing in helping industry in Poland and elsewhere to address the key challenges facing the sector by, for example, facilitating innovation and better protection of intellectual property rights.
Continuous subsidisation cannot be an answer to challenges to competitiveness.
We in the Commission, like you, are interested in a viable industry that can operate without state intervention and without state aid and compete on its own merits.
That is the case for many shipyards in Europe, particularly in the sector of technologically sophisticated vessels.
Mr Tomczak and a number of other Members compared the financial sector situation of today and the banking situation, and who does the economy serve?
The declining EU share of world shipbuilding will not be reversed by keeping yards in unsustainable activity, and Mr Chruszcz and Mr Tomczak touched on the general line with the financial crisis.
I tried to explain this in my first statement.
I would like to say a little more on the questions asked by some of you.
A question was asked about the possibility of applying state aid rules less strictly in the light of state aids currently approved by the Commission for financial institutions.
This is an interesting question, and it is not only within your meeting of today.
But it is also a fact that we have to see why the Commission seems to be stricter in the Polish shipyard cases, while it authorises massive aid to European banks.
The situation of the Polish shipyards, if you will allow me to say so, is completely different to that of the banking sector.
There are two reasons, which I shall explain to you.
No 1: the bankruptcy of a major European bank could trigger the collapse of a number of other financial institutions and produce systematic negative effects on the whole economy of one or more Member States.
So we are currently considering emergency short-term aid measures for banks, as opposed to restructuring aid spread over many years for the Polish shipyards.
By the way, if banks were to require longer-term state support, they too would be subject to similar requirements to the Polish shipyards.
They have to deliver a credible restructuring plan.
They have to ensure a long-term viability for their beneficiaries.
So it is indeed a fact that, within the banking sector at the moment, we are also approaching the banks with restructuring and viable business plans for the future.
I do not see why some of you are so concerned with the nationality of the purchasers of the assets of the yards.
If they are the ones who are the real entrepreneurs and if they are the ones who are interested in those assets, let us go for it.
We owe it to the workers of the yards to seek a solution without regard to nationality or protectionism.
That is not the answer I would like to give to the workers who are interested in their jobs, in jobs that are viable.
I am very glad that a couple of Members recognise that the yards are flexible and that we do not make a religion out of it.
If only producing ships is the only opportunity, I think we are not dealing with these cases in a professional way.
There should be sustainable production of whatever product over there with the craftsmanship of those people.
If demand is growing and the workers and the yards are competent, which I believe - as you were mentioning - then we can give them a chance by freeing them from the burden of past state aid.
I shall try to conclude, as I can read your body language.
One of the main issues that I was faced with is: can you not give more time?
Is that the way we should deal with this very difficult issue?
I think that all those workers have the right to ask us to come up with a viable solution for their future.
What we, the Commission, are presenting and what we are asking the Polish Government and where we badly need your backing towards the Polish Government is that they are aware.
Just deliver the business plan for Gdańsk.
Please, please, please.
And just be aware that for Gdynia and Szczecin there is an opportunity.
There is a future, but then we have to act in such a way that the burdens of all those to be repaid state aid over recent years are taken off the assets and that, with the assets in a bundling, there is a new future for activities in both yards and in both areas and regions.
It is absolutely crucial that those assets are not with that burden, for if there is that burden on the shoulders of those assets then there is less interest from investors.
That, indeed, is the law of just thinking over the solution.
If the liquidation is to be done, it can be parallel, and if it is parallel then it does not take that much time.
If I had to face all those workers, then I would prefer to say, please go with this solution which the Commission is offering.
If you accept it, it can be done quickly, and do not tell me that, because the law in Poland is the way it is, you cannot change a law.
I am not absolutely sure that the law is able to fit in this solution, but if that is the case then you can just act as a government.
With my experience in the last century in another position, I know - and I knew - that if you want a solution, there is a way out.
I ask you from my heart, for all those workers: please address the Polish Government.

in writing. - (PL) Multi-faceted protection of the soil is one of the main challenges for environmental protection at international level.
It also has a tremendous impact on the economies of the Member States.
I wish to express my concern about the consequences of natural degradation of the soil and degradation caused by human activity.
Degradation of the soil is often the result of inappropriate human activity in the areas of agriculture and forestry.
It can also be a consequence of industry, tourism, and urban development.
I should like to point out to the House that compliance with the provisions of the directive will make it possible for degraded land to be reclassified, thus preventing the use of green field sites for industrial and commercial purposes.
The directive will also provide for soil to be classified in terms of its potential for plant and animal production, with particular reference to the production of high quality food.
I should like to highlight the need to develop a European strategy aimed at identifying and resolving issues relating to soil degradation.
Due to the great variety of soil types, a European strategy is required, independently of national action.
Such a European strategy would be based on prevention, and would aim to raise public awareness and to persuade the public of the need for soil protection.
In addition, the strategy would identify risk areas with a view to resolving this problem at European level.
It should be noted that it is important to establish a clear demarcation between this directive and other European legislative standards relating to soil protection in order to avoid regulatory duplication.
Current European legislation does not appear to prevent degradation of the soil.
At the same time, soil protection is closely linked to the main international challenges in the area of protection of the natural environment.
I therefore believe that there is a clear need to develop Community legislation aimed at protecting the soil as such.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I really would like to reassure you that oil prices will go down.
But I would like to draw attention to the issues that somehow we have underestimated.
Oil markets have ensured the physical delivery of oil, gas markets are delivering physical supplies of gas and coal markets deliver coal.
That means that the interaction between financial markets and oil markets can work.
In other words we do not need to question the market, but we need to change the way we produce and consume energy inside the European Union.
This is the real answer, because we cannot expect the market to become easier.
There is growth.
If growth is there, then there is more demand for energy resources, and none of the existing energy resources are in such quantities that we can say easy access is guaranteed.
So for this we need a paradigm shift, we need to really invest in energy efficiency, renewables, research and development: a new investment.
But for this we need money, coming from both private investors and public investors.
So we should be able to do this only if there is a really functioning market.
A really functioning market means that everybody pays the real price to cover not only the cost but also the interest on investment.
What we need to concentrate on - and there is EU existing legislation on this - is public service obligations that apply to households or small and medium-sized enterprises that really need it.
But we should not deviate from this course.
I believe - and I have said it again and again - that the proposals made in the second package are crucial to making this change, and for this to be strengthened we will add a couple of elements in the second strategic energy review under the headings: infrastructure needs and diversification of energy supplies, external energy relations, oil and gas stocks and crisis mechanisms, energy efficiency and making the best use of the EU's indigenous energy sources.
We are on the right track.
We do not need to deviate and believe that there is a magic solution that will bring prices down immediately.
But, if we follow this path, we can really guarantee that already in this generation we will have efficient, affordable, clean energy.
If we are slow in changing the energy sector, then not only will we suffer but also the next generations will suffer.
So we are at this critical stage and, as the Minister said, energy is this century's main issue.
It is a main issue, but the public perception is not always there.
The belief is that we have this silver bullet which will change everything.
We should continue on the path we have started with Parliament, and I believe it is consistency that matters, and I very much hope that the proposed legal proposals will be adopted during this Parliament.
It is crucial: this is the best response to the rising oil prices.
<D>
in writing. - (RO) I voted for the European Parliament resolution on negotiations between the European Union and the United States with regard to the Visa Waiver Program.
I voted for the oral amendment proposed by the socialist Member of Parliament Lambrinidis, because he requests the exclusion of any form of direct or indirect discrimination among European citizens, including based on nationality.
Thus, attention is called on the consequences of the lack of coordination between the Community institutions and Member States, in international negotiations.
I also voted for amendment 8, orally amended by our colleague Gacek.
The new text expresses the European Parliament's dissatisfaction with the existent situation in which only the citizens of 12 Member States, such as Romania, are not exempted from visa for the United States of America.
I voted for amendment 1 submitted by the Group of European Socialists, which requests the Commission to guarantee, under the principle of loyal cooperation, equal treatment for all Member States citizens as regards the visa waiver.
I voted for amendment 2 submitted by the Group of European Socialists because it states that, at the meeting of 13 March 2008 of the Ministerial Troika on Justice and Home Affairs, the US admitted the Community's competence to negotiate an international agreement on visa policy.
<D>
(ES) Mr President, now that we are reviewing the Paris Declaration, we can see that the word 'intentions' has remained just that, just a word.
Although the Commission is working hard and taking measures to ensure aid arrives at its destination, we cannot make progress if Member States do not contribute what they have promised.
We know that both donors and partner countries are responsible for aid being more effective, but our greatest responsibility is to ensure that aid really contributes to helping developing countries meet the major challenges they face.
We must ensure that we fulfil our part of the bargain and that we do not have to feel ashamed because we are not doing what we promised to do.
Ideally, aid has a positive effect on development and good governance, but aid can also do a lot of harm if it is not distributed properly.
Developing countries must therefore take responsibility for implementing their own policies and we donors must respect that, give them our support and provide the space necessary for that to happen, rather than fund our own priorities as some donors do.
Finally, I would like to stress the need to ensure the coherence of our own policies.
All development efforts are a waste of time if the objectives of trade, monetary and other policies undermine or contradict them.
At the moment, we are not practising what we preach.
<D>
I still firmly believe that, as President Sarkozy was not going to organise a referendum, abstention was the position the Socialists had to take in the French parliament.
However, just because the French President did a poor job of negotiating this Treaty and ignored the vote of the French people, that does not mean we should not respond to the question being put before us today.
The Treaty is far from perfect, but it enables us to bring the institutional debate to a close and equip Europe with rules that allow it to function.
Today, the Socialists should make themselves heard on policy changes, the main issue in the revision of the financial perspective, on the French Presidency of the European Union, and on the PSE's commitment in drawing up its manifesto for the next European elections.
A 'no' would have made it possible to remove the policies from the text of what should have been a Constitution, as it forced Europe to focus on the issue of what the European project was all about.
This is very important.
However, because I want this text to be passed so I can get fully involved in the forthcoming negotiations on policies, because my 'no' more than two years ago was pro-European, I am shouldering my responsibilities and approving the Treaty of Lisbon.
<D>
Madam President, the subject of today's debate is a violation of human rights that took place during the 1930s, during the Japanese occupation, when young women in the Imperial Armed Forces were sexually exploited and forced into prostitution, despite the fact that the Japanese Government had signed international conventions on combating traffic in women and children and supported the UN Resolution on Women, Peace and Security.
The sincere sympathy of the Japanese premier is currently being undermined by Japanese officials in connection with the closure of the Asian Women's Fund programme and mandate in March 2007, out of which only monetary compensation was paid to women.
In supporting the resolution and the demand for compensation, we would, however, point out that in modern times, too, the boundary between the normal and the pathological is being eroded, and this flies in the face of moral norms, so there is a need for radical moves to combat prostitution as a form of modern-day slavery.
Prostitutes are not just victims of wars that took place 50 years ago; it could also be women of today who are being exploited, in the Belgian Congo, for example, as reported in the press, and indeed in many other countries, even rich ones.
In the name of respect for the human being we should also unmask the spread of a hedonistic and commercial culture that is pointing towards abuse in the area of sex, drawing even very young women and girls into the sphere of prostitution and other forms of demoralisation.
Respect for the identity and dignity of women is not based solely on uncovering crimes or abuses in the sphere of sexual discrimination or other injustices; it is based primarily on the drafting of development programmes and on the real-life practice of principles embracing all areas of a woman's life.
These principles must be rooted in a new realisation of the worth of a woman as wife, mother, carer or employee, as a human being and a person who is the equal of a man, despite being different.
<D>
Mr President, I would like to thank all my fellow Members.
We have managed to find a common position with regard to the Council.
However, I would also like to thank the Council and the Presidency of the Council very warmly at this point.
Anyone who knows me will be aware that I am normally very sparing with praise and thanks.
Nevertheless, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the Swedish Presidency and, in particular, Mr Lindblad, for its work and its constant presence during the discussions on budget issues.
This made a pleasant contrast to the other Council presidencies that I have experienced during the course of my long career as a Member of Parliament.
Thank you very much.
This morning, many Members took part in the discussion and I believe that on this occasion, there were many more Members involved than usual.
The majority of them referred to the limitations of the budget and its structure.
Ladies and gentlemen, we can confidently assume that the 2010 budget will be the last of its kind, the last with this structure, which leads us to believe that we can finance the necessary policies of the European Union and its new challenges and tasks in this way.
We expect the new Commission to carry out the mid-term review quickly, as, under the terms of the agreements made in 2006, this should have been submitted by 2009 at the latest, in other words, by the end of this year.
To spell it out, we also expect a revision proposal for the current financial perspective.
We cannot wait until 2014 for reform.
We need sustainable instruments now, so that the European Union can meet the challenges of the immediate future with democratic legitimacy, as the Chair of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Lamassoure, has just called for on behalf of all of us.
<D>
I voted in favour of the Casa report on the adoption by Slovakia of the single currency on 1 January 2009, in which the European Parliament is won over by the positive recommendations of the Commission, the ECB and the Council.
Slovakia has in fact made huge efforts to meet the Maastricht and convergence criteria.
The growth of the Slovak economy since the fall of its Communist regime is remarkable and Slovakia's entry into the single currency will be a just reward for the country, which has implemented a strict reform agenda.
In terms of inflation, the European Parliament has expressed its concern over the sustainability of inflation in Slovakia in the medium and long term, as identified in the last ECB Convergence Report.
However, it is our view that the Slovak Government could take the necessary measures to avoid inflation escalating after it joins the euro area.
Bear in mind that inflation forecasts for the euro area for 2009 are well above the ECB's 2% target.
It would therefore be unfair to penalise Slovakia for its struggle to meet criteria that even euro area members will not fulfil in 2009.
<D>
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, yes, the proposal for a directive on the internal transport of dangerous goods is an important issue, because around 110 billion tonnes/km of dangerous goods are transported in the EU every year: 58% by road, 25% by rail and, up to now, 17% by inland waterway.
The purpose of this proposal for a directive is to simplify and coordinate the existing rules on the transport of dangerous goods.
It also extends the scope of the EU provisions, which currently cover transport by road and rail, to transport by inland waterway.
That simplification reduces the red tape and improves intermodality.
Common rules on transport by road, rail and inland waterway ensure a uniform level of safety throughout the Community in internal and cross-border transport.
Uniform rules governing means of transport simplify and promote multimodal transport.
Extending the scope of the provisions to inland waterway transport is a welcome move.
That means the same safety rules apply to all Community inland waterways.
That will have a positive impact on working conditions on board, on transport safety and on protection of the environment.
Uniform rules reduce costs by avoiding the need for a variety of authorisations and permissions.
Moreover, that is likely to improve the potential use and the market prospects of transport by inland waterways; after all, we are trying to shift more transport of dangerous goods to inland waterways.
The draft amendments adopted by the Committee on Transport and Tourism largely reflect the Council's position.
We are in agreement and we want to try to get this through at first reading if possible.
Let me underline that I do beg the House to adopt one particular draft amendment, which the rapporteur has already mentioned and which represents a compromise.
It is important to include sensible provisions in this dossier.
Here we are in agreement with the Commission and the Council.
The draft amendment relates to the provision allowing Member States to lay down specific safety requirements and possibly also to prescribe the means of transport if they can justify it before the Commission.
In conclusion, let me give warm thanks to the rapporteur, with whom we were able to work so well together, and request the House to adopt this report at first reading.
<D>
(FR) Mr President, I should like to address the commissioner in order to voice my concern.
The development of the virus seems to be stabilising in Mexico, in Europe and so on, and, only today, I have heard comments on the radio to the effect that we may have gone too far, that our fellow citizens may have been made to worry unnecessarily.
Well, what concerns me, Commissioner, is not what is happening now, but what is going to happen in October when winter approaches.
It is well known that viruses do not like high temperatures.
The danger is therefore not there at present, but it will resurface in the winter - in October or November.
Thus, what we should like to know, Commissioner, is what you are doing precisely to ensure that we are fully prepared to tackle this virus that is liable to develop, that may mutate between now and then.
We are told that vaccines must be made, but is it certain that those vaccines that are going to be developed will be fit for use in all cases?
Those are all of the questions that I am wondering about.
The concern is for next winter.
Communication is therefore necessary; it must be explained to our fellow citizens that, whatever happens, it is not a question of letting their guard down, and that they must remain vigilant.
Might it be possible, Commissioner, for you to distribute a kind of small guide to help our fellow citizens adopt good habits?
<D>
(DA) Mr President, Greenland is part of the Kingdom of Denmark with significant responsibility under Home Rule.
The Arctic is not uninhabitable.
It is not an unregulated landmass like the Antarctic.
On the contrary, the landmasses are part of the Arctic countries and four million people already live there, a third of these being indigenous people.
These people and their nations have a legitimate requirement to exploit the resources and the opportunities found in the area.
It is only the sea in the middle that has international status and in this regard the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) forms the relevant legal basis.
This approach was also confirmed by the Arctic coastal states in the 2008 Ilulissat Declaration.
In addition to UNCLOS, there are a large number of other relevant international and regional instruments.
There is scarcely any need for more governance.
At most there is a need to adapt the instruments already in place.
Denmark has submitted a proposal to the Arctic Council to examine the existing agreements with a view to updating them.
This will and should happen in cooperation with the Arctic states and the Arctic peoples.
<D>
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am most grateful to all the speakers for their interesting contributions.
My special thanks go to Mrs Creţu who drafted the opinion on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality.
Her clear analysis and proposals for greater coherence have enriched the report in many important areas.
For reasons of time I cannot, unfortunately, discuss all her contributions and I hope she will not take that as a sign of disrespect.
Many thanks to Mrs van Lancker, Mr Berman, Mr Lambsdorff, Mr Hutchinson, Mrs Scheele, Mrs Doyle, Mrs Weber, Mr Varvitsiotis, Mrs Hassi and Mrs Gomes.
They are quite right to say that reproductive health in the developing countries has absolute priority and it is important to fight for it boldly and consistently.
I vehemently disagree with Mrs Krupa's view that the sexual freedom of women provokes violence.
That is an appalling and discriminatory kind of logic!
(Applause)
I say to Mr Deva that I did not expect anything different from him.
Please forgive me for that remark.
My dear Luisa Morgantini and Mr Romeva i Rueda have, as ever, found strong words to make it clear that women do not want handouts but simply what is due to them as half of humankind.
Many thanks to all those who support my report.
I am also glad that NGOs in the field of development and women's rights have given a most positive assessment of the report.
I am very grateful for all the cooperation and support I have received.
(Applause)
<D>
(LT) When Alexander Lukashenko started to feel the pressure from Vladimir Putin over gas, he declared his desire for closer ties with the EU.
However, today we can see that this was just empty rhetoric, which was not followed up with respect for human rights, freedom of the press and other European values.
There was no reaction to the non-paper 'What the EU could bring to Belarus'.
Political arrests and repressions are continuing.
The EU should send its experts without delay to observe the preparations for the autumn parliamentary elections, to see how election laws are amended and whether the opposition is given a chance to act.
We cannot limit it to election observation only.
That would be a huge mistake.
Of course, first of all we need to ensure that EU diplomats and parliamentarians are freely allowed to enter Belarus.
The European Commission and the EU Member States should do everything in their power to achieve this.
<D>
(ES) Madam President, we see the harshest and most dramatic face of illegal immigration when good weather arrives at the shores of the Atlantic and the Mediterranean.
Mafia groups operate much more frequently now that there is apparently less risk.
That is why this debate is so necessary: to support, facilitate and encourage any initiatives to prevent and neutralise a criminal scourge that puts so many lives in jeopardy and breaches our frontiers with frequent impunity.
External action by the European Union is becoming a vital component within such a context.
This is borne out by the Montavia and Cape Verde pilot projects.
The House recently allowed the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs to take part in this task by authorising two trips to Senegal and Mauritania, prime examples of countries of origin and transit for illegal immigrants.
EU external action on immigration must henceforth be more active and more visible and focus on much more relevant countries, primarily Guinea-Conakry.
Frontex has made good progress in a short period of time.
It has funds, EUR 70 million to be precise, and well-designed capacities for coordination, but we need the unambiguous assistance of the Council, for example, to make the CRATE database more than a catalogue of means or a declaration of offers.
The problem is persistent and dramatic, and requires us to pursue our efforts and maintain our systems of prevention, assistance and supervision, with resources and staff deployed on a permanent basis and in a timely manner, in the Canary Islands and the Mediterranean.
During the first quarter of the year 1 702 immigrants reached the Canaries, as against 1 425 over the same period of the previous year.
Now more immigrants are arriving, but they are using fewer boats.
In three years 48 305 immigrants arrived in the Canary Islands.
It is true that the numbers fell between 2006 and 2007, from 31 000 to 11 000, but the harsh truth is that increasing numbers of immigrants are arriving at Canary Island ports and every day we find bodies in the Mediterranean, either near the coasts of Oran or the Canaries themselves.
Moreover, Madam President - and I am finishing up now - between 15% and 20% of repatriated immigrants try again.
The problem is thus a persistent one.
This is why we need more common global willingness and less common rhetoric.
<D>
Vice-President of the Commission. - This question is very well known to me and has already been dealt with many times.
I must say that, first of all, Mr Richard Boomer is not a property developer, as is stated in the question.
All information about him is available on the website.
He has been my special adviser since 1 April 2006 and his mandate was renewed in 2008 for the period from 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2009.
His mandate as special adviser is as follows: advise the Vice-President responsible for administration, audit and fraud prevention as regards property policy; improve relations with the competent authorities in Brussels and Luxembourg; optimise effectiveness of the investments to be made by the Commission.
I must say that he has really provided us with valuable expertise, knowing what is going on in the real estate field in Brussels or Belgium mostly, though not so much in Luxembourg.
His advice has been valuable and I must say that also the lines of command in the matter of property policy at the Commission are very clear.
The definition of property policy falls within the competence of the Personnel and Administration DG under the authority of the Vice-President in charge of administration.
This policy is implemented by the Office for Infrastructure and Logistics Brussels (for Brussels) and the Office for Infrastructure and Logistics Luxembourg (for Luxembourg).
In his capacity as special adviser, Mr Boomer, like all special advisers at the Commission, advises on the policy and perspectives on a long-term basis in the matters laid down in his mandate.
He has no role in the process of decision making or in the underlying management procedures such as, for example, the acquisition of buildings or the suspension of a long-term lease.
On the third question, relating to an unnamed Belgian real estate entrepreneur, the Commission has no knowledge of the pressures suggested by the honourable Member.
On the last question - the big one - I am very happy to inform the honourable Member that the European Commission announced publicly, in a communication on its property policy on 5 September, its will to maintain a strong symbolic presence at the centre of the European area, while developing in parallel up to three additional sites outside this area.
This policy makes it possible to ensure the best added value for use of public money and puts downward pressure on the high level of prices within the European area.
In accordance with this policy, the Commission published in June 2008 a call for information addressed to the market in order to have better knowledge of the existing possibilities for the development of a site external to the European area from 2014.
This call was made with full transparency, via publication in the Official Journal.
The Commission received nine offers and is currently undertaking a technical examination of them.
The Commission would reassure honourable Members that the choice of the site to be made in 2009 will be based on careful examination of the merits of each offer, pursuant to clear procedures and in the best interests of the European Commission and the taxpayers' money.
Until this decision is taken, the Commission will not express a view on any of the offers which have been examined.
On the question of when the results of the architects' competition for Rue de la Loi will be announced, the Commission can only state that this question does not fall within the competence of the European Commission but has to be submitted to the Brussels Capital Region, which launched this town planning competition.
According to information available to the European Commission, the final result is expected in spring 2009.
I am sorry about the long answer but the details were also substantial.
<D>
(CS) Mr President, although the EC Treaty guarantees its citizens free access to services beyond their national borders, only a handful of service providers and consumers make use of this advantage of the common market.
A low level of competition thus makes services in the border regions more expensive and not always easily accessible, compared with services within a country.
Surveys show that the problem lies not in language barriers but in legislation.
It is not always clear when to apply the legislation of the country of origin and when to apply national legislation.
Unfortunately, thanks to the opponents of the country of origin principle, we lost out on the opportunity to provide a better definition in the Services Directive.
Here in Strasbourg this report is also accompanied by an irrational fear of mentioning the country of origin principle, notwithstanding the fact that in many professions service providers do not have to know the neighbouring country's legislation in order to provide cross-border services.
Soon we will see case-law that will end the disputes about when the issue of consumer protection is governed by national legislation or the legislation of the host country.
I consider Mr Lehtinen's report to be an excellent contribution in this respect because, in my opinion, our definition of providers' general obligations should be based on agreed European standards.
I agree that when it comes to consumer protection, the same obligations should apply to the providers of private and public services.
I also support the financing of communication networks between Member States.
This will lead to effective control and to progress in solving disputes out of court.
Commissioner, we owe the European citizens a lot when it comes to the conditions governing the free movement of cross-border services.
This report settles one part of this debt.
The European Parliament gives the Commission the political support to clearly define providers' obligations regardless of their origin.
Mr Lehtinen's report is testament to the excellent work of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection.

(DE) Mr President, Mrs Malmström, Commissioner Samecki, as a newly elected member from Mecklenburg-Western-Pomerania, I very much support the development of a Baltic Sea Strategy and the associated action plan.
The Commissioner referred earlier to the flagship projects, 80 in total.
Our common objectives are, of course, to improve the competitiveness of our economy in the Baltic Sea area, taking particular account of the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises and of a common energy policy which also takes account of renewable energies.
That raises the question of how we deal with offshore installations in the Baltic Sea.
Maintaining clean water, because that is our foundation and our resource, plays a very, very important role here, when we think of fisheries and when we think of tourism.
That is why investments in treatment plants need to be promoted.
I think a common planning programme needs to be agreed for all Member States in the Baltic Sea area, because we need to answer the following questions: where will traffic routes be positioned in future?
Where will offshore installations be built?
How will safety at sea be addressed?
That is why we also need to be clear on where the energy routes will be for Nord Stream, for the supply of electricity, and on many other things.
(The President cut off the speaker)
<D>
on behalf of the UEN Group. - Madam President, I would like to thank the President-in-Office and the Commissioner, as well as my colleagues, for their comments so far.
The national movement for democracy in Burma said 18 years ago: What will it take to make the international community persuade the authorities in Burma to take on board democracy?
Do we have to be gunned down in the streets and this to appear on television cameras before the international community will respond?
Unfortunately, that prediction is now coming true.
We can see that one section of Burmese society, the Buddhist monks and nuns who live a life of non-violence and of pacifism, who give to others of their time, are now being slaughtered in the streets and intimidated by the military regime.
It is incorrect for people to think that any words that we speak here will achieve the ends we want to see.
However, likewise it is incorrect that the world has stayed silent for so long; we can no longer remain silent.
And, as colleagues have said, it is up to us to use our influence, not just against the Burma regime but also our influence with China, India and Bangladesh to ensure that there is coherence and adherence to the sanctions that are in place and the demands for democracy.
Let us act to condemn the violence against peaceful protest but let us also ensure that we can give support to those protesters.
<D>
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (FR) Mr President, Mr Jouyet, it is time for contrition - this appears to be the mood today - or at least for rethinking dogmas and instinctive reactions, and moreover, I am grateful to Mr Sarkozy for giving, this morning, an example of this which seemed sincere.
Therefore, let us also rethink our old, very old mistrust when it comes to Russia, or rather mistrust of this country which is, whether we like it or not, one of our partners.
From this point of view, I also recommend - as Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck did - reading a biography of the Countess of Ségur, in particular the one by Mrs Strich, published by the excellent Bartillat, and you will see the true importance which should be placed on a word which you said twice, if I heard you correctly: 'interdependence'.
Yes, clearly we are interdependent, but not just in terms of fighting terrorism or weapons of mass destruction.
We are interdependent from all points of view: with regard to energy, to state the obvious, but also with regard to research, industry and politics, in a multi-faceted manner, of course.
Let us consider what the face of Europe in the 21st century will be like, depending on whether our nations will still be involved with promoting the immense riches of Siberia.
So please, let us stop espousing disputes which are not our own, but those of a third power with an interest in dividing Europe in order to dominate it.
Believe me, in this regard I am considering Europe's interest, if you will accept that French sovereigntists also are concerned by this matter.
<D>
in writing. - (PL) Mr President, many economists are pointing out that the South Asian region has the potential to become a world economic centre in the future.
This is a dangerous trend, especially for Europe, which could lose a significant proportion of world trade.
In Europe, meanwhile, we keep on tightening up conditions for companies and agriculture and trading with countries that do not even respect copyright law.
In the light of this, can we talk of free and fair competition?
Of course, we must strive to support respect for human rights in Asiatic countries, but we must not do this while handing over European markets to goods that are manufactured under conditions that do not meet European competition standards.
At the moment we are concentrating strongly on economic competition within the EU.
Here we are making a mistake as well as acting foolishly.
Meanwhile, Asia is subduing us economically, just as Europe subdued Asia militarily and politically in the past.
<D>
in writing. - (GA)
This directive brings to the fore the very important recognition that discrimination is not something which only happens in the workplace.
The main aim of the permanent Commission's recommendation is to address discrimination based on religion or belief, on disability, on age or sexual orientation and the implementation of the principle that people be treated equally outside the work environment.
I know, as a result of dealing with disability rights groups and disabled people in Ireland, that this legislation will be warmly welcomed.
Mrs Buitenweg is completely correct when she says in her report, 'to guarantee equal treatment of every person with a disability, the prevention of discrimination is not enough.
Positive action is required as well, in relation to measures implemented beforehand and through offering appropriate adjustments.'
I also welcome the firm stand taken by the rapporteur and the Commission to prevent discrimination on the ground of sexual orientation.
Discrimination of this kind has no place in a modern society and I reject the efforts of some political groups to weaken the legislation in this regard.
<D>
Mr President, I supported this report because - as we have already heard - small businesses are the backbone of our economy.
Many Member States' plans for economic recovery stress the important role small businesses can play in bringing us out of the present crisis.
99.2% of my region's businesses employ fewer than 49 people.
The West Midlands has the highest proportion of small businesses of any region in the UK.
Providing that proper consideration is made of Member States' competences in areas such as collective bargaining rights, this report will go a long way towards making sure that we all think small first.
I especially welcome the emphasis in this report on the difficulties that small businesses are facing in accessing credit, time and resources for education and training, and - most importantly - for research.
National borders, increasingly, are irrelevant to small businesses, which are doing more business with partners across Europe.
However, we do need to protect them when they engage in cross-border trading through measures such as my recovery of debtors' assets report.
The EU also has a key role to play in ensuring that SMEs have access to funding, which means we should ensure that non-bank microcredit is made available.
We can do this by using structural funds and developing microcredit institutions without taking money from the taxpayer.
This initiative can curb unemployment and restart our economy.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - I am going to the places close to Athens.
I will be having a debate on the first day with three committees from the Hellenic Parliament and we will certainly discuss this issue too.
I am aware of that and of the seriousness of the issue.
Maybe I could tell you why we are actually in favour and we are even co-financing some of the landfill, even if we do believe that this is on the lowest level of the preferred options in the waste hierarchy.
The first and absolutely most important thing that must be considered of course is human health, so we have to be sure that this is protected by all means.
I think it is important that we definitely look for and try to find the best possible options but sometimes it is simply necessary to go step by step.
I have seen from the data I receive from all across Europe that once a country starts seriously on separate collections, the route to very high levels of recycling and very low levels of municipal land filling is very short.
So separate collection is the fundamental thing and when this is done well then things can move fast.
But sometimes, unfortunately, land filling is still the only possible option and, if we want to take care of human health in this context, we simply have to provide that.
<D>
Thank you, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the message from our debate can only be one thing: there is no violent solution in the Middle East.
There is no military solution.
There is no solution through terrorism.
It may be the case that one party gains a short-term military advantage.
It may be the case that a terrorist act causes a great deal of chaos.
Yet experience shows that every act of violence generates more violence and pushes the cycle of violence further.
What is crucial, therefore, is dialogue, and that is something that is extremely difficult in the Middle East, especially in a time of uncertainty and, to some extent, of asynchronicity.
Yet there is also hope emanating from the United States.
President Obama, Hillary Clinton and their team offer a consensus and dialogue-oriented model, something completely different from the previous administration which has now, thankfully, left office.
So there is hope in Washington.
What about Jerusalem, though?
What Benjamin Netanyahu had to say during the election campaign certainly did pose a threat to the peace process, while Avigor Liebermann is also certainly a threat to the peace process in the Middle East.
This asynchronicity poses a risk.
What is going on in Lebanon?
What influence will Hezbollah have in future?
To what extent is it prepared to engage in constructive dialogue, before and after the election in Lebanon?
What about the Western-oriented majority?
Would that majority be able to react to an election victory by integrating Hezbollah?
Is Hezbollah prepared to allow itself to be integrated?
This depends, to a crucial degree, on who governs in Tehran.
The issue of the election outcome in Iran is of central importance.
This is also true for the attitude of Hamas.
The question of whether we have a radical president who denies Israel's right to exist - as the current incumbent does - or whether there is to be a government that is prepared to talk and this readiness to talk stretches from Tehran to Beirut and on to Rafah is a crucial issue for the stabilisation of the whole region.
We are in favour of a unity government for the Palestinians.
Without a unity government for the Palestinians, the peace process is unmanageable.
It is therefore now up to Hamas to show that it is willing and able to join such a government.
The basic precondition for this, however, is to be talking with Hamas, that those amongst the Palestinian people who want to talk with Hamas be supported and that they not be forced onto the defensive by a government in Jerusalem that knows only the politics of continuing the settlements.
As a side point, if it is true that 163 hectares have now been re-released for settlement, this is a destabilising element and this is something that we need to be absolutely forthright in making clear to our friends in Israel.
In the Middle East, everything is interconnected.
It is not possible to simply pick out individual elements and believe it possible to solve an individual problem by military means.
That is why the basis for everything is the readiness to talk.
The Arab League's plan, Saudi Arabia's peace plan, envisages an end to violence with simultaneous recognition of Israel's right to exist.
This is a bold and ambitious plan, and it is one that needs to be discussed.
It is progress in itself that there are people in the Arab League, in the Arab camp, who are prepared to have that debate.
That is something that must be supported.
Bombers are not the way to support this, and I might add that the way to support the work of the European Union is likewise not for what we build to be destroyed again for whatever military reasons.
For this reason, our message can only be that dialogue is the precondition.
High Representative Solana, you said that this is your first time before us this year.
This is perhaps also your last visit before our elections in June.
As dialogue is very much a sine qua non for success, I would like to say to you, on behalf of my group, that you represent the personification of dialogue.
Your work deserves more than respect.
It deserves a great degree of admiration, above all, for your continuous advocacy of dialogue.
For that, you have our sincere appreciation.
(Applause)
<D>
(SV) Thank you, Madam President.
Let me begin by thanking Bernard Lehideux for his excellent work, for excellent contacts with the President and coordinators during the process and for enabling us to achieve a settlement on first reading.
I also want to thank the representatives of the European Training Foundation for their input, an important contribution providing many further links.
Education, vocational training and lifelong learning are increasingly important.
They are important in the EU, but also in the partnership countries.
There is a need for cooperation between Cedefop and the European Training Foundation.
This proposal for a new Regulation contains some elements which make for improvements.
To begin with, the remit is broadened to include lifelong learning instead of focusing solely on vocational training.
This is a concept which we increasingly draw upon and which is important in our policy.
Secondly, the number of countries is increasing, as Mr Lehideux said.
They include all the partnership countries, not just those included in the neighbourhood and pre-accession programmes, but all partnership countries.
Thirdly, relations with Parliament are strengthened.
We have enjoyed good cooperation which can now be developed through the new Regulation.
I think that we have arrived at a good settlement, both as regards the way we appoint the Director of the Foundation but also as regards the fact that we can appoint three experts without voting rights on the Governing Board.
We did not get all we wanted, but it is still a good compromise which bodes well for the future.
It is a good basic position.
We can develop lifelong learning as a cooperative process between Parliament and the foundations working on these matters.
That is important.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - (EL) Madam President, I would like to thank all the speakers for their positive comments.
I fully acknowledge and share Parliament's desire to achieve a high level of protection for human health and the environment, particularly in those countries that do not have the requisite infrastructure or capacity to correctly handle hazardous chemicals.
I also fully agree with the view that the European Community should play a leading role in establishing a legal framework for the Community so as to ensure a high level of protection.
On many points, the regulation does not restrict itself to the provisions of the Rotterdam Convention, but lays down implementing conditions that offer a high level of protection for all the countries of the world, not just for members of the Convention.
I am convinced that this example will encourage other countries to follow suit and to join the Convention.
The Commission will make every possible effort to support the Rotterdam Convention to enable these goals to be achieved.
In response to the concerns voiced on arsenic and mercury, the Commission would like to stress that, pursuant to Article 22(3) of Regulation 304/2003, if metallic arsenic is banned or subjected to a rigorous restriction within the Community, then a proposal will be submitted for the application of the relevant annex.
Furthermore, the Commission stresses that work is in progress in the Council and in Parliament concerning the proposal to ban exports of mercury to countries outside the Community, a ban which, as long as it is in force, goes beyond the requirement for consent imposed by the Rotterdam Convention and the Community regulation, which implements it.
Once again I would like to thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs for their efforts and their excellent work, in particular Mr Blokland.
The Commission is particularly satisfied with the result of negotiations and considers all the proposed compromise amendments to be acceptable.
As for the dual legal basis, it would, in fact, have been much easier and simpler had we had a single legal basis, but we well know the problem that arises so often: here we have, if I remember rightly, Article 133 with Article 175, while in most other cases we have Article 95 with Article 175.
Certainly, in proposing a legal basis, we always rely on the opinion of our Legal Service.
Here, as I have already said, we have dealt with trade and the environment, and this was the reason for the European Court of Justice's decision on the dual legal basis.
<D>
Madam President, I would urge my fellow Member Mr van Orden to consider the fact that the only person here who supports him is the German far-left extremist.
To Mr Pflüger from the left, I would say that a glance at the law will facilitate its understanding.
It is not about exports at all, it is about the European internal market.
Otherwise, what Mrs Weiler said is correct.
She said that these products are expensive through lack of competition.
Yes, when there is no competition, they are expensive.
We will hopefully introduce more competition into the European internal market.
This will certainly not make these products cheap, but perhaps more reasonably priced at least.
This is a big opportunity, an opportunity for the industry to open up new markets and an opportunity for medium-sized companies to penetrate these markets, too.
However - and this is quite important - it is also an opportunity for transparency and thus for civil society, which will be able to keep a better eye on the way this market is structured and on what is happening, and for many non-governmental organisations.
I would like to expressly thank Mr Mladenov and Mr Toubon for their reference to the unusual work involved in this project.
In essence, it is a project under the second pillar, that is the strengthening of the European security and defence policy, using an instrument of the first pillar, namely an internal market directive.
Without the splendid work of the French Presidency mediating between the Member States - an extremely difficult task - it would never have succeeded.
We must expand these opportunities.
It will be an opportunity for the political Europe.
It will be an opportunity for the Common Foreign and Security Policy and an opportunity for the Europe of values and of peace.
This is an opportunity that we must take advantage of.
<D>
(FR) Mr President, first of all I should like to offer my sincere thanks to Mrs Hieronymi and to the Committee on Culture and Education.
The worldwide development of the European film industry is made possible thanks to this new MEDIA Mundus programme.
In fact, this programme is rooted in a policy.
It was created under the MEDIA International action which, since 2007, has focused on the development of the European Union's relations with the audiovisual markets of third countries.
The aim of this action was to meet the immediate needs of third countries and to improve the overall effectiveness of MEDIA 2007.
It was important to address the new problems and challenges resulting from the globalisation of markets, which affects the European audiovisual sector.
This preparatory action thus paved the way for a European Union programme of extended aid promoting global cooperation in the audiovisual industry.
Then, very quickly, the European Commission - which I congratulate - adopted a proposal to establish the MEDIA Mundus programme.
With a budget of EUR 15 million for the period 2011-2013, the programme will offer new possibilities for international cooperation and networking - and this concept of networking is extremely important - among audiovisual professionals from the European Union and from third countries.
Audiovisual media are very popular among young people.
They make a huge contribution to the promotion of cultural dialogue, and the task, here too, is to establish new global balances in this sector between the United States and between other continents, which are major producers, and Europe, which has its rightful place.
The programme is open to partnership-based projects involving a minimum of three partners, with each partnership being coordinated by a professional from the European Union.
Developing information sharing, training and a sound knowledge of markets, improving the competitiveness and transnational distribution of audiovisual works worldwide, improving the circulation and exposure of audiovisual works worldwide, and increasing public demand for cultural diversity - all of this is covered in this programme.
We support the European Commission's proposal, as it means that this consensual programme that we have arrived at can be implemented.
I am full of hope for this text; I endorse it because it is in keeping with my firmly held beliefs about respect, about intercultural dialogue, and about providing support for creative work, for training and for the audiovisual industry, and I should like to offer my sincere thanks to Mrs Hieronymi.
I know that, in the next parliamentary term, we will owe it to her to continue to work along these lines.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - I am taking this debate on behalf of my colleague, Mr Almunia.
The proposal on the table today concerns one of the core values of the Union, namely solidarity.
Against the backdrop of the international financial crisis, the Commission proposes further reinforced solidarity with the Member States that do not yet benefit from the protective umbrella of the euro.
The facility for supporting Member States' balances of payments is, by definition, foreseen for exceptional circumstances and was only used on a few occasions in the past.
We do, however, live in exceptional times.
As you know, the Commission proposed last year an increase in the ceiling of outstanding loans that the Community can provide to support Member States' balances of payments.
The ceiling was raised from EUR 12 billion to EUR 25 billion, but a substantial part of this amount has already been earmarked.
At the request of the countries concerned, the ECOFIN Council decided to provide balance of payments support to Hungary of up to EUR 6.5 billion in November.
On 20 January it decided to grant up to EUR 3.1 billion to Latvia, and the decision to provide up to EUR 5 billion to Romania is in the pipeline.
Already earmarked financial assistance under the regulation thus adds up to around EUR 15 billion.
There is, moreover, no immediate end in sight to either the financial crisis or global deleveraging, and ongoing financial stress in other Member States could result in further needs for financial assistance.
The European Council of 19 and 20 March therefore welcomed the announcement by President Barroso that the Commission intended to make a proposal for increasing the ceiling of the Community's balance of payments support to EUR 50 billion.
The doubling of the ceiling will provide an important signal to financial markets of the European Union's strong commitment to helping Member States under financial stress.
The extension of the total possible credit line to EUR 50 billion will provide a large buffer to cater for further possible needs for financial support.
Such strong signs of solidarity among Member States should also help to calm financial investors' fear of further financial market deterioration in the Member States outside the euro area.
By reducing the incentive for capital withdrawal, it would decrease the probability of balance of payments problems in the concerned countries.
In this context I would like to express my gratitude and respect for the excellent spirit of cooperation at the European Parliament and, in particular, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
The Commission adopted this proposal just before the Easter holidays on 8 April and only two weeks later you are now about to vote your legislative resolution and motion for resolution in plenary.
Thanks to your swift and efficient work, the ECOFIN Council will be able to adopt the amended regulation on 5 May.
The European Union will thus be well equipped to react rapidly should the need for further balance of payments support arise.
This is a powerful signal to Member States that the European Union is willing and ready to help and should be turned to in the first instance in case of balance of payments problems.
This obviously does not exclude that a Member State would also ask for assistance from other international organisations such as the IMF, with which the Commission has been closely cooperating on the latest financial support packages.
I would like to conclude by saying that I agree with the statement in your draft motion for a resolution that the current international situation proves the relevance of the euro and that all Member States outside the euro area should be encouraged to fulfil the Maastricht criteria in order to join it.
<D>
Mr President, I do not think that Mr Ferrari has been the worst in this connection.
As a matter of fact, my experience has been one of very constructive cooperation with someone who did not give the impression of being under the thumb of the automobile industry.
We should of course have preferred to see a report that went even further in its endeavours to protect pedestrians and other vulnerable road users against cars, and the ideal scenario would have been to get many more drivers using public transport or bicycles.
Nevertheless, since this goal lies so far in the future, we are pleased to have done something about car equipment.
As many have mentioned, it is to be welcomed in this respect that the legislation is now to cover heavier vehicles, so that stricter requirements on car equipment will counter the trend towards ever larger cars.
I should also like to commend the rapporteur on pressing for BAS - Break Assist systems - to be made standard in cars without delay, to help drivers stop in time.
It is also to be welcomed that requirements on the design of car front ends have been imposed, so that any collision with a vulnerable living human being does as little harm as possible to the unlucky person.
However, we need to go down to 40 km/h for this to make sense.
The requirements on this should have been even stricter, as should the time limit.
After all, there are already products on the market that offer significantly better protection for pedestrians without jeopardising the safety of drivers or passengers.
It is not the rapporteur's fault that this has been progressing so slowly.
There is much to indicate that there has been another case of lobbying by the German automobile industry, in particular, which these days is at the most reactionary end of the scale compared with the rest of European industry.
It is depressing if this is the reason why we have again ended up with a proposal that falls short of our wishes, by which I mean the wish for fewer deaths and injuries on the roads.
Why are we simply taking the automobile industry's word for it - and we have just heard this again - that the technology is not yet sufficiently advanced?
It is!
I very much hope that my fellow Members will now at least vote in favour of Amendment 25.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Council has done this year what it always does: it has allowed its civil servants in the Ministries of Finance to put together a budget that takes into account the Council's main aim which is 'keep the figures down' and, most importantly, 'keep payments down'.
It bears no relation to the political plans that we in the European Union want to implement - no relation at all!
The Council in its many formations is still in the habit of preaching on Sundays and being content to let others, that is, Parliament, do the real work for the rest of the week.
It does not matter whether the issue is external policy matters, or aid for Kosovo or Palestine or about implementing policies on competitiveness for growth and employment that are extremely important for Europe, vital to its survival, in fact.
Parliament looked ahead and pointed out, even during negotiations on the financial perspective 18 months ago, that there would be problems with financing exactly these policies within the foreseeable future.
However, our message fell on deaf ears and now the Council has to make it up as it goes along.
Sooner than we expected, we are facing a situation where we are having to provide public funds to rescue the Galileo project because the dream of entrepreneurial initiative has collapsed.
The European Parliament was able to agree fairly quickly that it would finance the beginning of the Galileo project with European money, by using the 'Community method'.
We see anything else as quackery, and want no part of it.
We are prepared to provide Galileo with EUR 2.4 billion from 2008 to 2013, in addition to the EUR 1 billion that were already planned.
However, since the required funds are not available in Heading 1a, and are not going to fall from the sky, we are prepared to take it from other budget categories, from Heading 2 2007 and 2008, making EUR 2.2 billion, and EUR 220 million from Heading 5.
Certainly that is a lot of money from Heading 2, but it is possible without farmers being deprived of funds.
Prices for agricultural products are high on the world market, so our subsidies can be reduced.
The transaction for which we created the basis in the Budget Committee in the first reading, is called a 'minor revision'.
Pah!
The Council avoids even the most minor of revisions like the plague but that is the Council's problem.
Anyway, we are prepared to create the preconditions for Galileo, a flagship of European technological innovation.
That fact that, as part of this minor revision, we are prepared to make funds available for the European Institute of Technology is, for us, worth only passing mention, due to the size, well, actually the smallness, of the amount initially required: EUR 2.9 million from 2008 to 2013.
We expect the Council to get moving and to come to Parliament and move in our direction.
Mr President, allow me one further remark.
We really expected the Finance Minister or at least a State Secretary from the Portuguese Council Presidency to attend this debate at the first reading, so that we could welcome his presence.
Nothing against you, Mr Mourato, but even the Portuguese Vice-President of our own Parliament is no substitute in this instance.
<D>
(PL) Mr President, the inclusion of the European Parliament in comitology procedures is necessary in view of the development of its legislative competences and especially as part of the codecision procedure envisaged in Article 251 of the Treaty.
This is the direction followed by the Council Decision of 17 July 2006 and of Article 5a introducing the new procedure under which Parliament will decide jointly with the Council on the grounds for proposing certain implementing powers.
The new 'regulatory procedure with scrutiny' will relate to measures of a general scope which seek to amend non-essential elements of a basic instrument adopted in accordance with codecision.
The Council Decision is of revolutionary significance for the course of the legislative process, as it enables Parliament to veto a Commission proposal relating to implementing powers.
As a result it will be possible to modify a proposal or return to the legislative path.
It is very important that the alignment package is adopted as quickly as possible, in order for the new procedure to be applied straight away to the existing acquis.
I am therefore calling for us, in the forthcoming vote, to adopt the Commission's proposal covering a list of legislative instruments that are to be aligned to the new procedure along with amendments proposed by the competent parliamentary committees.
At the same time I would like to point out that what will be of crucial importance to the success of the current comitology reform is the way in which Parliament makes use of the potential that is appearing before it.
The requirement for an absolute majority of votes to reject the Commission's proposal on implementing powers or extending the procedure caused by, for example, the need to translate documents into the 23 EU languages may have a negative impact on the progress of the procedure.
We should also bear in mind that Parliament may become the target of enhanced pressure from various circles that have an interest in influencing the final shape of implementing powers.
An extra challenge, both in general and for organisational reasons, will also be to take into consideration the enormous number of implementing instruments that will come before Parliament in the future.
<D>
rapporteur. - Commissioner, the maritime service agreement cannot be overestimated.
We all know how important the Black Sea route and land transit across Ukraine could be for Europe - for all of us - but without our support the future of this area is not certain.
I will now speak in Polish.
rapporteur. - (PL) My fellow Members have mentioned the need for close cooperation and have emphasised the fact that Ukraine obviously belongs to Europe.
They have gone on to talk about investment, tourism and enterprise.
Of course, much depends on Ukraine itself.
That is obvious.
Perhaps especially now, today, and tomorrow, in the weeks to come, the polarised Ukrainian people need help on the economic, political, scientific and social fronts.
Let us stop criticising so much; let us rather take sensible and constructive steps.
This is for the good of both sides: Ukraine and the EU.
Thank you all very much for the debate and may I ask for your strong support for this report.
<D>
The European Parliament report on the EU Common Foreign and Security Policy, in conjunction with the corresponding report on the Common Security and Defence Policy, produced by the anti-grassroots alliance of conservatives, social democrats and liberals in the European Parliament, maps out the constant support of the political mouthpieces of capital for the promotion of even greater militarisation of the EU, especially following the entry into force of the reactionary Treaty of Lisbon, and their active role in promoting the imperialist policy of the EU and the interventions and wars which it unleashes against third countries and peoples in every corner of the planet, in order to serve the interests and sovereignty of monopoly capital under conditions of escalating imperialist infighting.
The report calls for:
a) effective organisation of the EU's European External Action Service (founded under the Treaty of Lisbon), the new political/military arm for organising, supporting and implementing the imperialist interventions of the EU;
b) an increase in spending from the EU budget for its military and political interventions;
c) better interweaving of the EU's political and military capabilities, with a stronger EU/NATO link being pivotal in the more effective exercise of its imperialist interventions using military means.
The Greek Communist Party voted against and condemns this unacceptable report, which is purely and simply a manual for imperialist attacks against the people.
<D>
(RO) I would like to raise for discussion some ideas regarding the legislative package in the Social-European agenda.
I appreciate very much the European Commission's initiatives in this field and those presented in its communication named "Improving competencies for the 21st century - European cooperation on schools.”
In addition to these initiatives, I would like to propose to the European Commission to launch a pilot project for creating a European scholarship for children in economically and geographically disfavoured regions.
At European level, 19 million children and young people are subject to poverty and 6 million abandon high school every year.
In Romania, for instance, according to a Eurobarometer study, young people in the rural environment and those in mountain or isolated regions have a 5% chance of attending higher education.
This percentage is very far from the European Union's 85% objective of young people who have access to secondary university education.
Member States lack the necessary financial means to remedy this worrying situation themselves.
Consequently, the European Union should fight by any possible means, such as legislation, funds, European policies, to promote the opportunities and access of all young people to education.
<D>
(FR) Mr President, 2007 - this year of the German and Portuguese Presidencies - will go down in the history of European integration as the year of the ultimate snub to the peoples of Europe and to democracy.
The treaty that will be signed tomorrow in Lisbon is neither simplified nor consensual.
It is nothing more nor less than a rehash of the Constitutional Treaty, to which the French nation said 'no'.
Yet most of you, along with Mr Giscard d'Estaing, are noisily celebrating.
To those of my French colleagues who support this Constitution-with-a-makeover I must therefore address a very solemn warning.
The provisions of the treaty create a new state.
That state is being imposed upon our people against their will and it will therefore have no legitimacy.
The consequence is quite specific, and quite dreadful: the organs of the European Union and the texts that they produce will have to be regarded as unlawful.
Soon, therefore, we shall have a pressing duty incumbent on us under international law: the duty of disobedience.
I have nothing further to say.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - The European Union is preparing to assume a greater role in post-status Kosovo.
Ongoing status negotiations notwithstanding, significant preparations are being made for the future International Civilian Office and an ESDP mission of rule of law for Kosovo.
The Commission is financing CSFP joint actions establishing planning teams in Pristina.
These teams have developed the blueprints for the future missions on the basis of the Ahtisaari plan.
However, the final shape of the future international missions will depend on the exact outcome of status negotiations.
The Commission has worked in close cooperation with the two teams in order to ensure a coherent overall EU presence in a post-status Kosovo.
I would also like to use this opportunity to thank the European Parliament for its excellent cooperation in facilitating the financing of these very important missions.
The Commission fully supports the work of the international Troika which is currently leading the negotiations and there is the deadline of 10 December for the Troika activities as confirmed by the contact group ministerial in New York in September.
At this point in time it is too early to speculate when exactly Kosovo's status will be resolved but it is clear that prolonging the agony will not serve anybody's purpose.
On our behalf, we are ready to turn every stone and even more in order to achieve a negotiated solution which would be best for everybody.
We ask that from both sides and from our partners in the international community, while at the same time, of course, we are preparing ourselves for better or worse scenarios as regards Kosovo's status.
<D>
Mr President, I should like to make clear from the outset that we can endorse the use of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) for these three applications.
The applications meet the criteria, and therefore the workers made redundant are entitled to support from this fund.
Yet I should like to seize this opportunity to draw attention to a major shortcoming of the EGF.
We are currently developing a shared vision of the future of the economy and the labour market in Europe.
The various political groupings in this House may not fully agree on how exactly to do this or how far to go in this regard, but we are in reasonable agreement on the broad lines.
More sustainability and more inclusiveness are required.
If we wish to achieve these objectives, we must seize the opportunities now.
At this very time, when tackling the crisis, we must take action that brings us closer to this sustainable economy.
In my opinion, we are letting some opportunities go to waste with the present mobilisation of the EGF.
It is a crying shame that the fund, one of our instruments to confront the crisis, is not pointing the way forward.
We must dare to make real choices.
If we ensure that people who are now losing their jobs in polluting industries such as the car industry are retrained for work in sustainable sectors with a view to the future rather than remaining stuck in the past, this will make clear what direction we want to move in, and will also bring the innovative, inclusive and sustainable economy that bit closer.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I am taking this debate on behalf of my colleague, Commissioner Vassiliou.
I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Peterle, for this report, and Members of Parliament for their interest in the white paper putting forward an EU health strategy.
I am delighted that Parliament supports the health objectives and principles of the white paper.
The Commission welcomes this report, and fully agrees with the key issues it raises, in particular the need to address health inequalities, to focus on promoting health by encouraging healthy lifestyles and to help prevent diseases.
I am pleased to say that these issues are at the very top of the Commission's health agenda.
Health inequalities between different regions in the EU and between different socioeconomic groups are a growing concern, and the Commission plans to bring forward action later next year to help bridge the health gap across the EU.
The Commission fully shares your views about the need to promote healthy lifestyles, in particular as regards nutrition.
We all agree that this requires action targeted at citizens of all ages, in schools, the workplace and other settings.
This is a key component of the health strategy, and initiatives will be developed in the next couple of years.
In the mean time, we are actively pursuing our strategies on nutrition, overweight and obesity and on alcohol-related harm.
The Commission also fully agrees with Parliament about the need to step up our efforts to prevent diseases.
In addition to encouraging healthy lifestyles, we share your views about the need to support effective screening to detect diseases, in particular cancer, at an early stage, and to foster greater exchange of best practice.
The Commission is actively supporting the implementation of the Council recommendation on cancer screening and has recently updated the EU guidelines on breast and cervical cancer.
But we need to do more to help health systems fight cancer.
I am pleased to announce that the Commission plans to launch an EU platform for action on cancer next year to help Member States exchange knowledge and good practice in the prevention and treatment of cancer.
The Commission welcomes Parliament's emphasis on the role that a healthy workforce plays in delivering the Lisbon agenda.
Now let me comment on a few additional issues that the report raises.
Parliament calls for the establishment of European centres of reference.
These would be leading centres of expertise in particular conditions, such as rare diseases, that require a combination of expertise and resources that many Member States do not have.
The Commission will build on the principles agreed between Member States for such centres and will continue work to promote such centres in the framework of the future directive on patients' rights in cross-border health care.
Parliament also underlines the need for effective measures to tackle the rising problem of resistance to antibiotics.
The Commission shares this concern and is actively supporting Member States in implementing the Council recommendation on anti-microbial resistance.
We will present a report on this next year.
Finally, the Commission endorses the views expressed about the need for health and social policies to work closely together.
Mainstreaming health concerns in other policies is indeed a key principle of our strategy, and we are currently exploring synergies on a wide range of issues between these two policy areas.
In conclusion, the Commission and Parliament share the same vision about the key health issues that we need to address.
The time has now come to take forward work on the strategy and translate words into action.
The Commission will work closely with Parliament, the Council, the Member States and civil society in transforming the strategy objectives into better health for all across the European Union.
So I thank you for your support and I look forward to hearing your views.
<D>
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, flexicurity is nothing new.
It is an old Danish model, dating right back to the late 19th century, whereby security not enshrined in contracts of employment is guaranteed by the government, at great cost.
What is new in this Europe of ours is terrible insecurity, which affects young people at work but damages society as a whole.
In order to combat this insecurity we must change tack and dispense with the laissez-faire methods and ideologies which brought it about.
It is not true that insecurity creates jobs and economic growth; the opposite is true.
Now, with flexicurity, we are experimenting with a new ideology, but one that preserves the old model of insecurity intact.
For this reason, my Group has fought for some very practical ideas: against the idea of a labour market rigidity indicator and in favour of a good employment indicator, so as to emphasise that stable, secure employment is the norm; against unjustified dismissal, in that it amounts to discrimination; against a recurring accumulation of atypical contracts, or lifelong insecurity, which is a modern form of slavery; in favour of the right of those not in employment to an income, as they cannot live on air alone; in favour of bringing together different forms of welfare assistance; and against discrimination affecting women at work.
The fact that no resources have been earmarked to guarantee flexicurity - there has been a 2% cut - and consequently that no reliable investment is possible, speaks volumes about the risk of this operation turning into nothing but hot air.
Workers and young people are calling for something tangible, not for outdated ideologies.
These are the points that we have fought for in this House and would like to see voted through.
<D>
in writing. - I welcome this effort to address the problems related to the 2004 Cod Recovery Plan which has clearly proven to be ineffective.
Despite various measures, cod stocks have shown little sign of recovery.
The most important point made in this proposal relates to reducing discards.
In the current climate of food shortages and extremely challenging times for fishermen, this can only be described as a totally illogical and wasteful practice.
The quota for Total Allowable Catches is so low and fishermen are forced to throw back large quantities of fish into the sea, despite the fact that this practice contributes nothing to the effort to replenish stocks.
Of course, we must continue to take measures which protect our cod stocks.
However, we should also bear in mind the bigger picture.
Climate change and the impact of global warming may have more to do depleted stocks than fishermen simply trying to make a living out of this industry.
<D>
The next item is Question Time (B7-0017/2010).
This will be a little shorter this evening than it should be because the preceding debate overran by 25 minutes because of earlier delays.
I am sorry about that.
We will finish some time after 19.30.
I intend to be very crisp on time.
Speakers from the floor have 30 seconds.
The following questions are addressed to the Commission.
Part one
Subject: Regulation of private pension funds
In recent years, the value of private pension fund assets has decreased a great deal.
The need for closer regulation of the private pension fund sector has been underlined by the high level group on financial supervision chaired by Jacques de Larosière.
The financial crisis has highlighted the extent to which Member States are vulnerable to a wide range of risks.
These risks are of direct concern to investors in those funds and to the stability and integrity of European financial markets, as well as seriously affecting financial market participants.
In this unstable period for the economy, many European citizens have lost confidence in the regulation of the private pension fund system.
Does the Commission not take the view that it should propose a comprehensive legal measure to lay down monitoring standards with the purpose of regulating private pension funds?
<D>
I would like to reply right away by saying that the Secretary-General and the Deputy Secretary-General put a lot of effort into ensuring our safety in Parliament.
Yesterday we spent a great deal of time discussing this issue at a meeting of the Bureau.
Procedures must be improved, but I would also like to take this opportunity to call on all the Members of the European Parliament to understand that a certain level of discipline is required of us.
I know that they are sometimes a burden, but if we want a Parliament which is both safe and open to the public, we must carry out checks, although I know that Members and I myself are sometimes irritated by them.
Please believe me when I say that there are only two options; either these checks continue, which will mean that we can feel safer, or we dispense with them, in which case there can be no question of safety.
I would also like to ask Members once again to take a positive attitude to the heightened checks, which I do not wish to have to abandon.
They will continue to be enforced in future.
We also have other plans to ensure that Parliament remains open, since it is very important that it does.
We want to be a Parliament which is open to the public, but at the same time safety requirements dictate that we must adopt certain measures which have not been necessary to date.
This also affects our assistants, and it has come to my attention that our assistants are much more indignant than even the Members.
I would therefore ask the assistants, who work very hard in Parliament, also to understand the need for these checks.
It is not only Members that are subject to checks, but also assistants.
I am sure that we will adopt these rules in order to feel safer.
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, let me start by answering a question that was put to me by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf.
He was asking why my amendments seek to make this system voluntary.
I can tell Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf very quickly why I seek to make it voluntary.
Last week in my constituency in Scotland, cast ewes - for the non-agricultural people in the Chamber (there are not many people in the Chamber), they are old female sheep - were selling for GBP 2 a head.
A year ago they were selling for GBP 60 a head; this year, GBP 2 a head.
I ask the rapporteur: how is a farmer who is only getting two quid a head for his sheep supposed to fit microchips and buy expensive scanners and readers that can comply with a mandatory electronic ID system?
This is the economic problem.
The original Commission proposal was perfectly correct in seeking stakeholder consultation and in seeking economic-impact cost-benefit analysis.
I have not seen all the figures.
I do not know what the intention would be for the sheep farmers in my constituency.
I have to remind the Members in this House that the UK has the biggest sheep flock in the whole of Europe - by far the biggest.
The impact of this would be catastrophic with the economic situation the way it is.
It would actually mean - if this becomes mandatory and we go by the dates set by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in their vote on Monday night, and we set 31 December 2009 as the mandatory introduction - that a whole group of sheep farmers in Britain will close down and go out of business.
The upland areas and the hills that have been looked after by sheep farmers and grazed by sheep for centuries will go wild and then the public will realise the damage that has been done.
While we are wreaking this damage in a flock that already has the best traceability in Europe - we have absolute guaranteed traceability in the UK at the present time and the sheep farmers cannot understand why we want to impose a new system of electronic identification when they already have high-quality traceability - we are importing sheep meat into the EU from outside, from countries that do not respect our levels of hygiene and welfare and the rigorous regulations that we apply to our sheep farmers.
So, let us have a little bit of sensitivity here.
I hope that when we come to vote on this tomorrow the Members will see the reason why we are asking for a voluntary system and not yet fixing a mandatory date for the introduction of electronic ID.
<D>
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, I am very happy to speak on this issue here tonight.
I believe that the job of a fisherman, or indeed a fisherwoman insofar as there are some, is one of the most dangerous jobs in the world.
Certainly, in Ireland alone, rarely does a year pass without some fishing boat being lost at sea, and many fishers are injured in their work.
As a former Minister for Social Welfare in Ireland it was my task to try and find a way in which the rights of people working on fishing boats could be respected.
It is an extremely complex area, where the issue is whether one is working under a 'contract of work' or a 'contract for work' - the difference being between those who are working as a normal employee for tax purposes and thus pay their social contributions to the skipper who is an employer, and those who share the proceeds of the catch, who are not treated as normal employees.
The difficulties in reconciling those positions are extremely complex.
As a Minister I managed to find a piece of European legislation which resolved the problem for a short period, but unfortunately it was subsequently challenged and found not to apply precisely to the issues at stake.
The importance of having common minimum standards which are globally applied really goes without saying.
These include standards of health and safety on board, accommodation, the provision of food, and indeed the guarantee that minimum rates of pay are also applied to those who are employees, and that there is an obligation on boat owners and skippers to ensure that people's contributions are fully paid up.
It is important that these are global minimum standards, because unfortunately the tendency has been for a race to the bottom in this area, as indeed in other areas too, so having this convention approved as soon as possible would certainly be something that I would urge at a very early stage.
I think 2012 is a long way away and we should try to shorten this deadline if at all possible.
<D>
(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament's agricultural experts have made a quite simple demand.
They are asking for no more and no less than the same conditions for production at home, that is within the European Union, as for imports.
I listened with interest as Mrs Vassiliou spent more than ten minutes explaining to us that essentially, this is not possible.
She could have answered more concisely.
She could simply have said: 'Yes, Parliament is right and I will put that in place and take it into account in future'.
What my group and now Parliament are asking for has nothing to do with trade restrictions.
On the contrary, it is a crucial requirement for fair world trade and for the mutual exchange of goods.
We want fair rules in the market economy within the EU and abroad, no more and no less.
We will be calling for this now and in future from the Commission.
You can be sure of that.
<D>
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, I too wish to congratulate Mrs Budreikaiton this excellent report.
The document makes reference to the Eastern dimension of EU external relations and the need for a new assembly on the lines of EUROLAT or EUROMED - an assembly that could build on the historical experience of the new Member States in particular, including my own country, Poland.
I fully agree with the rapporteur on this.
Europe needs a new vision of a broader sphere of influence extending through the Balkans and the Black Sea region to the southern Caucasus.
EU policy with regard to these regions is outdated.
The very name 'European Neighbourhood Policy' is inappropriate and insulting for countries like Ukraine, which is undoubtedly part of Europe.
The name should be changed to 'European Union Neighbourhood Policy', as the former Ukrainian foreign minister, Borys Tarasiuk, rightly pointed out at the last meeting of the EU-Ukraine Cooperation Council.
The European Union must give more support to Ukraine and Georgia and draw them into its sphere of influence.
Those countries need our commitment even more than the countries of Central Europe did before the 2004 enlargement.
They need an individual approach on the part of the European Union, not a general neighbourhood policy that de facto treats Ukraine in the same way as countries that historically do not belong to Europe.
Ukraine, Georgia, and Belarus too, are poorer, economically weaker and in greater political difficulty than the countries that joined the Union after 2004.
Recent years have seen a significant strengthening of Russia's position in the region.
Russia's readiness to use its energy reserves for political blackmail deters the European Union from opposing the Kremlin's shameful practices, which have nothing in common with democracy.
In Georgia and Ukraine, Moscow is attempting to reverse the democratic transition.
The European Union Neighbourhood Policy, as we ought to call it, must offer immediate political and economic aid to our nearest neighbours.
Poland already has projects waiting and ready to go, such as the Bielsat independent television project for Belarus.
<D>
The Stockholm Programme obliges the European Commission to present a proposal for accession of the European Union to the European Convention on Human Rights.
This is an important and significant step, which will allow us to develop a uniform, minimum level of protection of fundamental rights in Europe.
Thanks to accession to the convention, EU institutions will be subject to external, independent supervision in terms of conformity of the legislation and activities of the EU with the European Convention on Human Rights.
At the same time, the EU will be able to defend its position before the European Court of Human Rights.
This will eliminate the possibility of discrepancies arising between decisions of the European Court of Justice and the European Court of Human Rights.
In reference to point 16 of the motion for a resolution, I appeal for a prompt commencement of negotiations on accession of the EU to the European Convention on Human Rights.
In the context of the resolution under discussion, I call for the immediate withdrawal of Poland from the Protocol on the Application of the Charter of Fundamental Rights to Poland and to the United Kingdom.
With the coming into force of the Lisbon Treaty, the Charter of Fundamental Rights will apply to all measures undertaken concerning the Common Space on Freedom, Security and Justice.
It is disgraceful that the right-wing authorities in the Republic of Poland, by succumbing to pressure from the hierarchy of the Catholic Church, are denying Poles rights to which they are entitled.
The citizens of Poland should be able to enjoy these rights in the same way that the citizens of other EU Member States enjoy them.
If we do not want Poles to be second-class citizens in the EU, the Charter of Fundamental Rights must be adopted in its entirety.
<D>
(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, whether we rejoice or lament, everyone agrees that the Treaty to be signed in Lisbon is just a recycling of the European Constitution rejected by two referendums in 2005.
As a report yesterday by the House of Commons pointed out, it has everything: the primacy of European law, even secondary law, over national law, even constitutional law; legal personality for the EU, which will allow the Commission to represent the Member States on the international stage; the Minister of Foreign Affairs under another name; the largest transfer of competences in the entire history of European integration; at least forty new subjects; and the vast field of fundamental rights.
Within these walls, where the word 'democracy' is constantly on our lips, I would like to try and appeal to the consciences of you all.
What genuine democracy could think it normal to bring into force a text that the people have rejected in a referendum?
Why should the people be deprived of their right to express themselves on the new Treaty and on any fresh enlargements?
What sort of political regime do you think you are building by subordinating our democracies a little further to a system characterised by no separation of powers, no political accountability on the part of governments and no representation of the people, except of a single European people?
The Italian federalist Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa has already given the answer.
I quote: 'Between the two poles of popular consensus and the leadership of a few governments, Europe has been created by a method that could be defined by the term "enlightened despotism”'.
He is right!
And the people's no to their enlightened despotism has convinced federalists that they have to proceed once more under cover, because the only difference between the rejected Constitutional Treaty and the one that is coming is that the first one did not lie.
<D>
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to thank our colleague Mr Cornillet for his work on this report and for the debates he led in our Committee on Development.
I would also like to thank the Commissioner for his pertinent analysis at the beginning of this debate.
The report on humanitarian aid rightly focuses on the protection of humanitarian personnel and access to victims, which are the two major issues that humanitarian aid must tackle now and will have to tackle increasingly in the future.
In this respect, I would like to point out, as the Commissioner did, that the changes in the way the armed forces are used can blur the image of humanitarian actors.
The confusion caused by the use of military resources, at times to accompany humanitarian workers, inevitably results in NGOs and their teams losing the immunity they used to have in the field.
Moreover, in order to reach victims and demand a certain freedom of expression, it is crucial not to appear to be involved in these conflicts or dependent on the policies of the organisations' countries of origin.
In conflict areas the recent changes have made the perception of NGO positioning more complex.
In Darfur, in particular, several international NGOs, including Médecins du Monde, say that it is becoming more and more difficult for them to reach the victims outside the camps for the displaced and that there is a fresh upsurge of violence against the people and humanitarian workers.
Their room for manoeuvre is dependent on reaffirming their independence in relation to the armed forces involved on the ground and any political positioning.
It is also important to note that an increasing proportion of the financial resources of humanitarian NGOs comes from financial institutions, particularly European institutions.
This situation can also reinforce mistrust of these NGOs, which can sometimes see their action confused with the geo-strategic positions of the donor countries or the Union.
For that reason, I wish to stress here that the increase in public funding, which we welcome and which is an excellent thing, must not, however, lead to these NGOs being used as pawns.
In the last 10 years more than 1 000 humanitarian workers have been killed in more than 500 attacks on civilian aid operations.
If we do not make every effort to guarantee the independence of NGOs, their capacity for action will undoubtedly decrease and, consequently, the number of areas in which international humanitarian law is applied will be vastly reduced.
The media approach means that today the whole world is focusing on Zoe's Ark, which is an extremely small amateur association compared with the vast majority of humanitarian operations, which are carried out by recognised structures whose staff have great courage and human and professional qualities.
This isolated case must not therefore be allowed to discredit all humanitarian aid actors.
On the contrary, it reminds us that it is essential for humanitarian operations to be carried out strictly in accordance with international humanitarian law and the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council.
We therefore welcome the fact that this European consensus, which will be adopted at the next part-session, encompasses our request for the creation in the Council of a formal structure that is specifically responsible for humanitarian issues, and for an annual review of the consensus and its accompanying action plan.
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, the EU's motto is 'Unity in diversity'.
It is a principle that has served us well.
Unfortunately, such an idea does not resonate at all well with the authoritarian Communist dictatorship in the People's Republic of China.
Diversity is suppressed, rather than embraced.
Minorities wishing to express themselves in any way other than the mainstream Party-sanctioned way are routinely marginalised and persecuted.
This trend can be seen in the treatment of many religious minorities, including Christians, Muslims and Falun Gong practitioners, and most notably in the PRC's attitude to Tibet.
In 1950, Communist forces invaded Tibet, leading to the exile of the Dalai Lama 50 years ago.
Ever since then, Tibet has been under the control of Beijing.
The traditional Tibetan culture, which was isolated for hundreds of years, has now been heavily diluted by the actions of the Government, which has been at pains to prevent any sense of Tibetan nationalism from resurfacing.
In fact, the systematic and sometimes brutal suppression of Tibetan culture has kindled the fire of Tibetan identity and awakened the world's conscience to the plight of the people of Tibet.
The inspirational leadership of the Dalai Lama has ensured that Tibet's future remains very much at the forefront of public debate, notwithstanding the huge efforts made by the PRC to admonish those like the former President-in-Office of the Council, Nicolas Sarkozy, who dared to question Beijing's point of view.
We in this Parliament have always taken a strong line in defence of the autonomous rights of the people of Tibet, which does not automatically mean the right to self-determination or independence.
In doing this, we do not seek to provoke or antagonise China.
However, we recognise that our commitment to certain values - human rights, democracy, the rule of law and freedom of conscience - cannot be seen separately from the undoubtedly important strategic economic partnership that the EU is developing with China.
Pro-China voices on the other side of the House will have their say in this debate, but for too long the people of Tibet have been denied their voice, and we must speak for them.
<D>
author. - (ES) Mr President, as I was saying, according to the Campaign for Human Rights, Peace and Democracy in Burma, on 12 March, the oldest Burmese political prisoner spent her 78th birthday in solitary confinement at Insein prison.
This is U Win Tin, an eminent journalist and leader of the National League for Democracy.
U Win Tin is the oldest prisoner of conscience in Burma.
She has spent the last 19 years in prison, since July 1989.
She was sentenced to three terms of 21 years imprisonment.
We only know about her current situation because of the latest report on the conditions of Burmese prisoners by Yozo Yokota, Special United Nations Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights in Burma.
U Win Tin has refused to renounce her political ideals in exchange for her freedom.
She was taken into hospital for a second hernia operation in January 2008.
She is one of Burma's 1 873 political prisoners.
Obviously, in this resolution, we also want to express our condemnation of the extension of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's house arrest.
My group demands immediate measures to begin an urgent and necessary process of political and economic reform.
First, release of all political prisoners.
Second, the restoration of basic civil liberties and, obviously, a political dialogue between all parties.
We also reiterate our request to the Council to adopt vigorous measures against the Burmese Military Junta, which has become world leader in human rights violations.
<D>
(FR) Madam President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs, the Commission, Mrs Trautmann and Mr Harbour, who have succeeded in reaching a last-minute compromise.
After two years of intense work, we have achieved this compromise in an area that will mark the future of a leading industrial sector.
The Commission's proposal on use of the spectrum has been amended in the right direction, with respect shown for the achievements in satellite technology, and the Commission's announcement of a future debate on universal service and the other legal problems that still remain suggests that the work will continue.
This is therefore only a first step in anticipation of other regulations.
This project will provide citizens with extraordinary access to information and culture.
Many problems remain, however, from the point of view of infrastructure and quality, because access of the same quality is still not guaranteed to everyone, if one considers the many technical problems that still exist in relation to wireless communication.
Issues of freedom of access to the Internet, problems of copyright and confidentiality, combined with the concern to protect against crime, to safeguard ethical rules and to protect young people- is that not a bit too much to manage?
As for those who are sceptical about the compromise, will they be able to put forward a ready-made solution that is applicable immediately?
I think that this project represents a considerable advance.
Let us therefore give the regulators whom we put in place a chance, and the sceptics will then be able to influence these new institutions, which will have only to prove their effectiveness.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the example of Montenegro shows how important a referendum can be.
I therefore understand why numerous posters calling for a referendum were held aloft in the House today, as the Treaty of Lisbon itself, of course, gives us the option of offering the European people such a referendum.
I believe it is important that the general public are involved in the consultation process and that they have the opportunity to express their wishes.
In Montenegro I believe there is also a need to improve the country's economic structures; as Mr Posselt has already indicated, the educational establishments and programmes of the European Union are particularly important in that respect.
In energy too, energy efficiency and renewables pose a huge challenge in Montenegro as well as offering unprecedented opportunities.
In the telecommunications sector too, it would be desirable for Montenegro to transpose the Roaming Directive into national law because that could, of course, contribute to better communication with our European countries at more reasonable prices.
It goes without saying that the environment is one of the key challenges, and the domain of waste management, sewage works and waste water poses a particular problem.
If we speak of magnificent unspoiled natural beauty, we have grounds for applying the latest standards there.
The European Union is offering environmental support frameworks, which should be put in place as soon as possible.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, allow me to begin my remarks by pointing out that this is the second debate today on a foreign-policy issue at which the Commission has not been represented by the competent Commissioner.
This morning we had our main debate on the subject of globalisation, and the competent Commissioner was not present, and this evening the members of the Commission with responsibility for this important matter are once more absent.
I have nothing against our esteemed Commissioner Borg, but it would be proper, in my view, if the Commission were represented by the Commissioner with responsibility for the subject under discussion.
I should be grateful, Mr President, if you would forward this request to the Commission for future debates, and I am sure it serves the interests of the whole college of Commissioners.
I should like to express my sincere thanks to Mr Zaleski for his very balanced report.
We must improve our cooperation with our Ukrainian neighbours.
That is why it is good that the European neighbourhood policy should be shaped accordingly.
That is why it is good that Ukraine should accede to the WTO.
That is why it is good that we should negotiate a partnership and cooperation agreement, and it is good that we should support the vision of a free trade area as the start of a careful unveiling of a European perspective for Ukraine.
Let me also say at this point, however, that I cannot envisage Ukrainian membership of the EU for the foreseeable future.
Improved cooperation, to which many of my fellow Members have already referred, is also an urgent requirement and can benefit both sides.
I attach particular importance to fruitful cooperation and close solidarity with our eastern neighbours.
In my view it is intolerable, for example, that Russia should make its cooperation with Ukraine dependent on which government is in office in Kiev and which parliamentary majority the Ukrainian nation has elected.
That is intolerable, and Russia is on the wrong track with such a policy.
We as Europeans, as the European Union, must support the Ukrainian people on the next stages of their journey to independence and firmly established democracy.
Mr Zaleski's report constitutes a large and important contribution to that effort.
<D>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one of the few areas in which we recognise that the European Union can offer real added value compared with national initiatives is research.
That is why we are in favour of establishing a European Institute of Technology.
We also share the concerns, or questions, of the rapporteur.
The future EIT must be complementary and must not compete with initiatives already carried out at European level in the field of research and innovation.
Above all, it must not drain the budget allocated to the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development - which is already meagre enough - but should receive additional funding.
In view of its design, which consists of bringing public and private partners together, it would be much better if its resources came mainly from private funding and from its operating revenue.
This would be a sign of its usefulness and effectiveness.
Furthermore, the European Union should provide the impetus, rather than create yet another bureaucratic organisation that is a burden on European taxpayers.
For these reasons, it seems that the EIT label is a better idea than the possibility of the Institute issuing its own degrees and diplomas.
On this point also, the EU must offer added value and not try to replace what already exists.
Finally, this fear of pointless duplication, as well as financial and functional competition with other programmes, has led us to support an evaluation at an earlier stage than that proposed by the Commission, although the frequency of subsequent evaluations, extended to every seven years, seems too long.
If our fears materialise, we would have to act swiftly to make the necessary adjustments, or even substantial amendments, to the regulation.
Alternatively, even though this is not the norm for Europe, we would have to put an end to the experiment.

Mr President, I should like to start by conveying my heartfelt thanks to everyone who has contributed to this report.
I have submitted a critical, yet fair, assessment of the progress which Turkey made in 2008.
It is a report that contains many points, holds up a mirror for Turkey and only sends out one clear message, namely that for the third year running, too little has been done in the way of political reform.
Political reform and meeting the Copenhagen criteria are absolute priorities.
This is not about opening chapters.
This is about what unites European citizens, the rule of law, independent and impartial justice, the freedom of speech, a well-functioning press and an individual civil right for each citizen.
Mr President, more must be done in those areas.
Only then can political chapters be opened.
Mr President, Turkey should not prescribe these political criteria on our behalf.
The Turkish Government told its own citizens when it took office that it is necessary to modernise Turkey.
For this purpose, the political criteria need to be reformed, because in order to create a socially-oriented market economy, people must be given the opportunity to experience their creativity and all citizens must enjoy the same rights.
This is why the political criteria are now central in our report.
When I, along with the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC), and everyone else, visited Turkey, I got the feeling that something was shifting and could see a little light at the end of the tunnel, as Commissioner Rehn commented before.
Ten years ago, I could not have imagined that there would be television programmes in Kurdish.
This, too, has been included in the report.
Moreover, I very much appreciate Turkey's positive role in the Caucasus.
I have expressed my appreciation for the first steps in the direction of opening up the borders with the Armenians, because they too need to be released from the isolation they are currently facing.
Mr President, a national programme has been approved to carry out those reforms.
These are all positive elements, and I sincerely hope that Turkey will now apply itself to addressing these reforms with the new negotiator.
A modern and prosperous Turkey is of the utmost importance to the Turkish people, but - and I say this in every Member State - certainly also of major importance to us all in the European Union.
I should like to make a few more points, Mr President.
We frequently receive reports that the freedom of the media and press leave something to be desired and that the press, when it exercises it freedoms, is subsequently faced with fiscal assessments or other measures.
This needs to change.
Finally, on the subject of the amendments that have been tabled, I should like to counsel the Socialist Group in the European Parliament against them, to accept the report as it is before us.
We acknowledge that improvements need to be made, but we should not make additional requests, as these are unnecessary and will only lead to polarisation in this House.
<D>
Mr President, the Spanish Presidency will be judged on the basis of its institutional implementation of the Lisbon Treaty.
Prime Minister, I wish you every success.
To stimulate economic recovery and the creation of new jobs, your challenge is to bring about the completion of the EU's internal market, including opening up services markets in areas that are still treated as exceptions.
Until this has been achieved, the success of any EU strategy will have a limited effect.
I support your commitment to the creation of a common energy market, interconnecting energy grids all around Europe.
I wish you would use to this end Parliament's position on external energy security and solidarity that was adopted back in 2007 and is awaiting implementation.
Agenda 2020 means introducing information and communication technologies into everyday practice, making use of the best practices of Member States that have already made progress in this field.
I hope that your Presidency can decide about starting a central agency for administration of IT systems that Europe clearly needs.
What we also urgently need is to work out a reliable European cyber defence security strategy.
I hope that the EU will play a more active role in stabilising the situation in the South Caucasus, too, within the framework of the new Eastern Partnership strategy.
Last but not least, I suggest that you remain committed to the EU's common position on Cuba until real changes there can be confirmed.
Sadly, the refusal of the regime to allow our socialist colleague to enter Cuba because he wanted to contact the opposition is not a sign of real change.
<D>
Madam President, I should like to join Mr Bowis and Mr Maaten in congratulating the Commissioner on her Green Paper which is not a day, or even hour, too soon, in my view.
The Commissioner said herself that a rise in the ageing population will indeed bring more pressure to bear on health systems, but also, and mainly, on workers.
Indeed, anyone who takes the time to listen to the people working in the sector will know that the general working conditions are extremely tough, both physically and often also mentally.
Working in this sector demands a great deal from workers, and is often underpaid.
It should not come as a surprise, therefore, that the turnover of staff in the sector is very high.
It is also a fact that all too often, the contracts are very precarious, resulting in many people leaving the sector prematurely.
In my judgement, the Union will therefore need to pursue a number of things in its policy: sustainable employment, a good working environment, safe work, no brain drain, and decent work.
The Commissioner was right to make reference to the directive which Mr Bowis is currently working on, the Directive on cross-border healthcare.
In my contacts with people in the sector, however, they were also keen to point out the relationship between working as a health worker and the Working Time Directive.
In the Working Time Directive, contracts, rather than the people, are now used to determine the duration.
I have found out that there are Polish doctors who work in Polish hospitals on normal contracts during the week, and travel to the United Kingdom during the weekend to do a 48-hour shift there.
This is unheard of, of course.
This is something that should be taken into consideration, certainly in the Working Time Directive.
I therefore hope that this topic will also be addressed when we discuss the Green Paper.
<D>
(ES) Mr President, I would like to express our profound disappointment, not least from the viewpoint of the Socialist benches - despite being geographically peripheral - at the dreadful timing of this report.
Firstly, it has come too soon.
We have not even evaluated Eurovignette II yet, which only began to be implemented about six months ago, but here we are opening another new dossier.
In addition, we are in the grips of a cruel financial, economic and social crisis, which has had devastating effects on goods transport.
It therefore sounds like a bad joke to propose a measure now that necessarily means raising the cost of goods, especially those transported in the countries on the fringes of Europe, which are precisely the ones that are worst affected by unemployment and lack the alternatives of railways or motorways of the sea.
They simply do not exist and, moreover, there is no willingness at the border.
Furthermore, the European Parliament has historically called for internalisation for all modes of transport and not just for the one that is already subject to cross-border charging.
We asked the Commission to make a really creative effort to achieve an intermodal system based on solidarity and thus maintain consistency in our European commitment to a co-modal logistics chain.
This text contradicts that in its partiality.
Lastly, I am disappointed because I feel it is dishonest to tell people that this instrument will solve their daily congestion problem for ever.
If that were the case, the road haulage sector would be the first to call for this instrument, because that is the group that already pays for the delays caused by urban traffic jams.
The rapporteur is proposing a compromise that deserves praise for its sharpness, but it contains an obvious legal weakness which the Commission denies, even though it can see it, not to mention the confused message that we send out to citizens when we establish European rules that the Member States are free to implement or not as they see fit.
As I have said, this has come at the wrong time, and it is an incomplete instrument that shows little solidarity, at least with the fringes of Europe.
<D>
in writing. - I strongly support the consumer protection orientated calls of this Report from MEP Evans, in particular the call for the Commission to conduct a sector inquiry into on-line advertising.
Consumers are frequently misled by deliberately confusing online offers and advertisement despite European legislation that seeks to prevent this.
The Commission must act to ensure legislation in this area is upheld and not just a lip service to consumer rights.
I welcome the calls for the Commission to undertake and analysis of the effects of competition on unequal relationships between suppliers and retailers.
This is a problem of particular importance in Ireland.
This disparity in competition policy should not be permitted to continue and consumers are being punished further in an already challenging economic time.
I also welcome the General Block Exemption Regulation (GBERS) which allows Member States to authorise aid in favour of SMEs, regional development, training, employment and risk capital.
Measures which support entrepreneurship and innovation and bolster SMEs in this difficult time should be delivered quickly.
SMEs are the cornerstone of the economy and it is our duty to ensure that they are supported to the best of our collective ability.
<D>
(PL) Mr President, when analysing the report on the European Ombudsman's activities for 2009, I was glad to note the further development of cooperation between the Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions.
I rate very highly the work of Professor Diamandouros, who has been the Ombudsman since 2003, as well as his efforts in informing citizens of opportunities available to them to submit complaints about the incorrect functioning of EU administration and his encouragement of citizens to exercise their rights.
Taking into account the fact that that only 23% of the more than 3 000 complaints registered in 2009 came within the remit of the Ombudsman, he should absolutely continue his activities in the field of information.
Due to his limited competences, he is only able to investigate complaints regarding European Union institutions and bodies.
However, what is important is that everyone who submits to the Ombudsman a complaint that cannot be accepted on formal grounds receives information as to which authority they should turn to in each given case.
It is also important to stress that the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon significantly strengthens the democratic legitimacy of the Ombudsman and expands his remit into foreign policy.
It should also be noted that the Ombudsman is increasingly undertaking action on his own initiative; for example, regarding delayed payments from the European Union, disability and discrimination.
His actions have also led to the creation of the European Code of Good Administrative Behaviour.
Further good news is the fact that the time required to conduct proceedings has been reduced to nine months.
The high percentage of cases completed in which the institution that a complaint referred to came to an agreement or the case was resolved to the benefit of the complainant also testifies to the effectiveness of the Ombudsman and his good cooperation with other bodies.
This occurred in as many as 56% of cases in 2009.
I hope that the Ombudsman, supported by us, Parliament and the other institutions, will continue his work with the same energy and even greater effectiveness than to date.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, first of all I would like to convey the regrets of Vice-President Tajani for not being with us.
He is on a very important mission to Japan.
Let me go straight to the point.
The Commission remains fully committed to developing an EU policy in the field of urban mobility because it is convinced that, although responsibilities for urban mobility lie primarily with local, regional and national authorities, in some specific areas there is an added value of action at European level.
As a matter of fact, although cities are all different, they face common challenges.
The problems in urban mobility are significant and growing and affect many citizens and businesses, which are confronted with traffic safety problems, with limited accessibility of public transport, with congestion and health problems caused by pollution.
To illustrate the importance of urban mobility, let me provide you with some figures: 60% of the population lives in urban areas and 85% of the EU GDP is created there.
However, cities also generate 40% of CO2 emissions, and two out of three road accidents take place in urban areas.
Finally, congestion, which is one of the main problems that citizens have to face everyday, is responsible for the loss of about 1% of the EU's GDP every year.
Sustainable urban mobility is therefore a key element to achieve our goals with respect to climate change, economic growth and road safety.
This is why the Commission has been launching actions in this field since 1995, in order to promote the exchange of best practices.
The highlight has been the extremely successful CIVITAS programme that started in 2000.
The 2007 Green Paper 'Towards a new culture in urban mobility' then identified broad areas for potential complementary action at EU level to promote greener and safer cities and smarter and accessible urban transport.
But what can be done concretely at EU level?
We can help local authorities to implement related EU policies and to make best use of EU funding.
EU-wide dissemination and replication of innovative approaches can give authorities the possibility to achieve more and better results at lower cost.
We can help foster markets for new technologies, for example clean and energy-efficient vehicles, and facilitate harmonised standards for broad market introduction of new technologies.
Finally, the EU can guide authorities towards solutions that are interoperable and facilitate smoother functioning of the single market.
The Commission will therefore continue to act, because we think, as a large majority of stakeholders do, that there is much to be gained from working at EU level to support initiatives at the local, regional and national levels.
Now let me answer your question: why the adoption of the Action Plan on Urban Mobility has been delayed.
Unfortunately, the conditions were not appropriate for the adoption of a comprehensive action plan by the Commission before the end of 2008.
But my colleague Vice-President Tajani would like to reassure you that he remains committed to working towards the adoption of the Action Plan and to develop an EU policy in the field of urban transport in full respect of the subsidiarity and proportionality principles.
To this purpose, it is not the intention of the Commission to propose a one-size-fits-all solution; on the contrary, we would like to develop a toolbox, including short- and medium-term practical actions, in order to provide cities with the tools to address, in an integrated way, specific issues related to urban mobility.
Then, it will be up to local authorities to decide what is more suitable for them, according to their own objectives and needs.
In order to address the concerns that might still exist regarding the strategic role of the EU in urban mobility, Vice-President Tajani's intention is to demonstrate with concrete actions how the EU can add value and quality to urban mobility in Europe.
On the basis of the responses to the Green Paper and many discussions with stakeholders, a number of actions have been identified and will be launched later this year.
To promote innovative solutions and new technologies, we have already opened a call for proposals, closing at the end of March, which will provide up to 50% funding to the projects selected.
Once the Directive on the promotion of clean and energy efficient road transport vehicles comes into force, around March, we will initiate the development of an internet site to facilitate joint clean vehicle procurement.
On information and exchange of approaches, we intend to start up, around April, a website providing information on urban mobility legislation and funding in Europe, as well as on good practice.
We will also reflect with stakeholders on the future of our CIVITAS programme and how to build on the vast knowledge and experience generated in the CIVITAS-funded actions.
Finally, to help increasing knowledge on sustainable mobility policies, we will launch a study on aspects related to green zones and a study on the opportunities for making public transport systems more interoperable.
We intend also to establish an expert network for considering aspects of urban road pricing and internalisation of external costs.
I am convinced that this package of actions, which will be soon undertaken at EU level, provides an important basis for moving forward in the field of urban mobility.
<D>
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, I should like to express our support for Mr Mulder.
The concern underpinning the report has been to ensure that the principle of cross-compliance and its associated controls do not penalise farmers unjustifiably.
Agriculture is not simply one more economic activity.
It has a specific social role.
Payments conditional on fulfilling many environmental requirements are not only beneficial to farmers but also to society as a whole.
This broad social role of payments should constantly be emphasised.
A significant sector of society is unaware of this role and it should be explained to them.
I should like to make a very important point.
We require our farmers to abide by the principle of cross-compliance.
We impose conditions on them.
We should impose the same conditions on those who export their agricultural products to Europe.
In particular, the requirements concerning animal welfare should be imposed on all imports without exception.
Economic and humanitarian interests require this to be the case.
<D>
in writing. - (FI) Democracy literally means the power of the people.
There cannot be democracy without the people and it is not good for the people to be without democracy.
In Ireland the people were able to vote on the new constitution, the Treaty of Lisbon.
That was democracy, and the Irish voted no on behalf of all the other nations.
It accounted for 53.4% of the votes, with 46.6% voting yes.
In Ireland they did not want the EU moving in the direction of a federation, or becoming militarised, or a further shift of power towards the big countries.
The federation idea is promoted by men and women who are poor democrats and poor losers.
They have begun to revive the body by force.
They say that the small countries are not needed if they will not comply with the very real authority of the big ones.
This way they perpetrate the misconception of EU democracy.
The Irish are denounced for the way they exercised their powers but no one is laughing at the Hungarians, although the parliament there voted yes even before the unreadable treaty had been submitted to it.
The decision of the Irish people is democracy, but that of the Hungarian Parliament is not.
The desire to have a constitution for the EU does not come from the needs of the people but from the will to shore up the power of the elite.
Without referendums it will be a coup - in both the small and the big countries.
<D>
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, may I wish Mr Harbour a happy birthday.
Here's to our continuing fruitful cooperation!
And of course I want to thank all three rapporteurs.
As you may know, I was the shadow rapporteur for my group on all three reports, which is why I know how untiring your efforts have been to improve key aspects of this proposal from the Commission.
At the same time I would like to thank Commissioner Verheugen, who pointed out once again that the proposal is leaving Parliament in better shape than it arrived.
I think that is a significant comment, for we have all worked hard on this legislation.
We have truly done our best to improve conditions not only for businesses but for consumers too.
This package has three elements.
The main purpose of the Regulation on the mutual recognition of lawfully marketed goods is to remove non-tariff barriers, which could also be termed protectionist barriers.
In committee, however, we maintained a balance, to which Mr Verheugen referred and to which I also attach great importance, although it has sometimes been overlooked in this debate.
On the one hand, non-tariff barriers are to be removed, while, on the other hand, it should remain a matter for the Member States, naturally enough, to determine whether certain conditions apply.
In Germany, for example, we have an issue with Nazi symbols.
So if there are particular problems with certain products that cannot be recognised in individual Member States for ethical reasons, those Member States must retain the right to ban such products.
The balance has been maintained.
I consider this very important because it is the only way in which wide acceptance of the internal market and the principle of a single market can be engendered among consumers as well as among the relevant entrepreneurs.
In this respect we have taken a giant step forward.
I also consider it important to have established contact points but also to have demonstrated that these will not create any additional red tape, given that contact points have already been set up under the Services Directive and in connection with the mutual recognition of vocational qualifications.
The more contact points we establish, the greater could be the burden for individual Member States.
In this respect too, we have acted very responsibly.
Another important thing, in our view, was the need to say - as, of course, we did - that mutual recognition could only work if the conditions governing market access were the same in all Member States.
There were undoubtedly diverse conditions in the Member States.
Some were inclined to privatise or partially privatise market surveillance; some opted for certification, the certification body being more or less private.
We have made it crystal-clear that market accreditation cannot be anything other than a public responsibility, and we have given greater responsibility to the individual Member States.
I regard that as a very important step.
Market surveillance, of course, is also the key to establishing and maintaining product safety in the European Union.
When we talk about tightening directives and regulations, we should always be well aware that a directive or regulation is only as effective as the instruments that ultimately verify its observance, in this case the market-surveillance mechanisms in the Member States.
In this respect the Member States will now be under a greater obligation to develop, fund and staff their systems of market surveillance.
I believe this is a very important condition.
In the coming years, Parliament must continue to exercise vigilance so as to ensure that tighter market surveillance does actually materialise.
Another important aspect is the toolbox, for which Mrs Schaldemose was responsible.
This framework decision gives us a toolbox for future directives, which will ensure greater legal consistency on key issues, establishing a clear and coherent position on the CE mark in particular but also on the status of importers in the trade chain.
We have increased the responsibility of importers throughout the European Union.
That was another very important step forward.
On the whole, we can be very content with the package on the table today.
It also enjoys broad support from all the political groups.
Let me conclude by expressing my thanks to the Slovenian Presidency of the Council.
Without the strong support of the Slovenian Presidency we should never have managed to conclude this matter within the short time available to us before first reading.
My special thanks go to the Commission and the secretarial staff of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection.
Without them we surely could not have kept to the timetable and produced a genuine compromise in time for first reading.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - (CS) Mr President, this debate has been extremely comprehensive and detailed.
It would be very difficult to give a detailed answer to the individual comments, so allow me to provide a brief summary in response.
First of all, it seems to me that the debate has clearly shown that Parliament's welcomes the idea of social reality stocktaking, and though I agree with Mr Cercas that diagnosis is not the same as therapy, I am also of the opinion that no therapy is possible without diagnosis.
Our society is constantly changing and we have to find new methods to adapt to it or reform the old methods.
For this to be effective, we need to understand the global picture.
I think that the debate has another common denominator, and that is that although the social reality has its own dynamism to some extent, we also have our own values: a general European concept of a European social model that encompasses social inclusion and social protection and activity in general.
It is therefore not acceptable in our model of thinking and acting to adopt a passive view.
There is always the possibility of trying out active politics and active intervention.
There is also a third idea that I would like to stress.
There is no doubt that, like most policies, the majority of European decisions also comply with the principle of subsidiarity, according to which the policies to solve a given problem are dealt with in the best and most effective manner.
This means that there is no doubt in relation to the position of the Member States on social policy.
On the other hand, the debate also clearly shows that the goal cannot be reached at Member State level alone, without efforts at European level.
It is therefore our duty to find the most advantageous and effective synergy in this area.
The debate brought to light a concern that I also share to some extent: a concern that there is a risk that inequality and the incompatibility of the social policies in individual Member States may lead to competition that possibly lowers social standards.
The European Commission does not want to open this door.
Our fundamental concept is to make individual European social policies compatible in such a way that will ensure competition and development from the bottom up, with a view to progress that always includes a social dimension.
Ladies and gentlemen, the debate also clearly shows that social and economic policies cannot be designed on an 'either/or' basis.
The only possibility is 'not only/but also', which means the balanced development of both policies together, without making giving preference to one over the other.
The usual trend is to give priority to the economic policy.
However, I could see clearly from the debate that this approach is not favoured by the European Parliament.
Ladies and gentlemen, you mentioned a wide range of individual problems, notably the issue of the health service, including access to medicines and its overall organisation.
You discussed the effects of demographic ageing and the importance of services of general interest.
I am glad that all these views are represented in the European Commission's strategic documents.
We aim to integrate them into a general global strategy.
Ladies and gentlemen, allow me in conclusion to express my thanks to Mrs Lynne, whose report, which is currently being discussed here, is without doubt an important element of the global effort to ensure progress across the European Union.
<D>
The decentralisation of government brings increased responsibility to regional and local authorities.
Indeed, it is authorities at local level which best understand the needs of their regions and the people who live there, thanks to which they can adapt general objectives to their own potential and possibilities.
We will achieve success if the Member States identify with the work they undertake and responsibility for it is devolved to authorities at the appropriate level.
We should support a grass-roots approach, which should be flexible and integrated.
It is important for cohesion policy to be user friendly.
There is a need to reduce administrative costs and simplify procedures, the complicated nature of which, in many cases, not only results in mistakes, but often discourages beneficiaries from using support which is available to them.
We talk about reducing the risk of error, but we should not forget the plans and objectives upon which we have decided.
I am thinking, here, of innovative measures.
We have given an important place to innovative methods, so we have to reckon with the risk and possibility of mistakes being made.
We should, therefore, ask ourselves if we want to undertake work of an experimental nature in the spirit of the priorities of the 2020 strategy, or if we would rather reduce the number of mistakes, which would mean discouraging our citizens from undertaking innovative but sometimes uncertain work.
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (PL) Mr President, we are confronted by two different problems.
The first relates to the price of oil and gas.
The Union imports most of the aforementioned resources.
The second relates to the price of electrical energy.
Regarding the first point, I should like to say that oil and gas prices could fall, if the producers, not just the consumers, become subject to market forces.
This is a subject for our negotiations as a Union with Russia, the North African countries and OPEC.
We must also significantly improve energy efficiency and energy saving.
It is our duty to do so and we should give priority to this task.
We have been discussing it for a long time now.
Obviously, we must also develop the use of renewable energy, as it exploits our indigenous resources.
It will certainly not suffice for our purposes, however.
That leaves us with our coal and our nuclear energy.
If we wish to forestall drastic price increases, we cannot afford to disregard either of these two energy sources.
This leads on to the second point, namely electrical energy.
The cost of electricity could be reduced through a determined effort to create a common European market in energy.
Swift implementation of the third energy package is needed.
We can also control electricity prices through sensible and gradual implementation of the energy and climate change package.
This is particularly important for the electrical energy sector.
In connection with the latter, it is important to consider benchmarking or phase-in arrangements in the directive on the emissions trading scheme.
I should like to thank the Commission for undertaking such hard work on these matters, and the authors of the resolution for raising the subject.
<D>
(PL) Mr President, a review of the ten years of Economic and Monetary Union should be assessed from an international perspective.
The question we should ask is where the European Union has shown its advantages over its main competitors in the world, that is, the USA and Asia.
This perspective clearly shows that the Euro Zone balance sheet is in the red.
The European Union has been developing more slowly than its competitors.
Growth in jobs, and particular the growth in labour productivity has been lower than in the USA, not to mention Asia.
This means that the common currency is not fulfilling its fundamental role.
Another aspect is the future of the Euro Zone: documents of the European Central Bank and the authorities of the EU are placing increasing emphasis on the need to use the euro as a tool to impose uniform economic policies on the Member States, particularly as regards budgetary and fiscal policies.
This declaration is of concern to the more backward countries, particularly the new Member States.
How can they develop and close the gap with the old Member States if they are forced into a policy that slows economic growth in all Member States?
The main criticism of the European Central Bank is that in striving to make the euro a world currency, it is ignoring the economic problems of the regions and the less developed Member States.
It is also failing to take into account social aspects, such as demographic structure and the mobility of citizens.
The position of the EU authorities is even less acceptable when it is considered that for many years both Germany and France failed to comply with the stringent conditions of Maastricht, because they knew that this was in their national interests.
Furthermore, they were never called to account or punished.
Therefore, in my view, what is needed is not to continue the present economic doctrine of the Euro Zone, but a radical change which will help not only to counteract the present financial crisis, but will above all release the energy for every Member State of the EU to develop economically.
<D>
President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, I am grateful for all your contributions and comments in this debate.
I am delighted that the European Parliament, the Commission and the Presidency very much share the same view on the most important issues for the strategic dialogue between the EU and the US.
I am pleased to have heard strong support for the topics we chose for our first informal meeting with President Obama, namely: firstly, energy security and climate change; secondly, economic cooperation; and, thirdly, cooperation on security and external relations.
I listened carefully to other comments made, such as the need to build a new transatlantic agenda, to deepen cooperation in foreign assistance and development policy, to pursue cooperation in justice and home affairs, to keep up the momentum on the Transatlantic Economic Council, to explore setting up the Transatlantic Political Council etc.
We will take them into account as we prepare for the regular EU-US Summit to be held in June.
Those of you who raised the other issues, such as the visa waiver - because not all the EU countries are taking part in that - can remember how, a year ago, my country led efforts on that.
It was also the subject of a debate in this Parliament, so I can assure you that we will continue to raise this issue with the US Government as well.
In conclusion, I would like to add the following reflections.
It seems clear that the new US Administration has taken on board many of the messages that we have been sending them over recent months and years about the transatlantic relationship.
They are now responding.
For example, we are now being asked to provide greater strategic input on Afghanistan.
It is also clear that strategic input is expected to be matched by a very practical commitment, so I believe that you will remember this when we are discussing our practical contribution to the future Afghan mission.
It should come as no surprise for us once we are really engaged in a deep and serious debate.
When President Obama said in Berlin last year that America has no better partner than Europe, he was not just making a statement of principle, but also inviting Europe to provide the proof.
Secondly, it is clear to all of us that the challenges we are facing are getting more numerous and more complex.
To return to one of my opening points, when the EU and the US agree, we can help set the global agenda.
That also means taking our share of leadership and leading others to lend their support and provide means towards the goals set.
But to be able to do so and be a credible partner to the US, the EU must speak with one voice to the greatest extent possible.
The Czech Presidency will continue to ensure that the transatlantic partnership remains one of the cornerstones of the EU's foreign policy.
I look forward to developing this relationship further as we face new challenges together and I look forward to continued cooperation with this Parliament in doing so.
<D>
(FR) Mr President, it is surely regrettable that once again, on the eve of the holidays, we are meeting to discuss this same problem, which creates the impression that we are seeing no progress from one year to another.
At a time when most of our fellow citizens have doubts about the effectiveness of Europe, it is urgently necessary to show them that when natural disasters, be they fires, floods or even epidemics, put people's life and property at risk, Europe can respond and that, basically, when they are in trouble, they need Europe and that Europe is there for them.
Where are we today?
Once again, we talk about the need for solidarity and, of course, of the need for a binding framework.
We absolutely must convince Member States of the need for a genuine, operational civil protection force equipped with financial reserves, assistance mechanisms and additional European resources.
Of course we must strengthen humanitarian aid by filling the existing gaps as regards the provision of that aid and strengthening global capacity.
We have to create a training network.
As the Commissioner said, it is essential to train experts in emergency aid in the event of disasters, drawing on the experience acquired by Member States in the field of civil protection training.
Above all, however, we need to take preventive action and in order to do that we need genuine policies relating to soil, land and forest.
We need to take preventive action and only then can we prepare for disasters by taking remedial action and setting up early warning systems, for that is absolutely essential.
What is the situation with the Barnier report proposal?
I would like to see practical results in the wake of that proposal.
<D>
in writing. - (HU) An ever-increasing proportion of the population of the developed world understands the threat posed by climate change.
However, we need to take drastic steps if we are to reduce our emissions by 20% over 13 years.
Unfortunately, we are hardly seeing any steps to take us in this direction.
It doesn't matter which of the emitting areas we investigate, there will always be 'voices' that want to protect the very industry we are talking about now.
At the same time, we know that we can only meet the target that has been set if we involve every affected area in reducing emissions.
If we make an exception for one, we will have to make up for it somewhere else.
Which one will be the odd one out?
Air travel today is a tiny area, but one that is growing dynamically.
Its growth is closely linked to the global price of raw materials, on which it does itself have great influence.
We as politicians will truly support European businesses from a strategic perspective if we create an environment for them that encourages innovation.
None of this affects passengers, since the measures taken towards reducing CO2 will increase the ticket price for routes within Europe by a sum of no more than approximately EUR 1.
This is a fraction of what we have to pay for anti-terrorism security measures!
Together with this, however, a good-quality railway of 1000 km must compete with aviation and, to achieve this, the airlines must bear the costs to which they give rise, to the same extent as we expect it of railways and road traffic.
<D>
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (LV) Mr President, Commissioner, first of all I would like to thank all three of my fellow rapporteurs and also Mr Vidal-Quadras, head of the European Parliament's delegation during the conciliation procedure.
Certainly, nobody is completely satisfied - not the rapporteurs, businesses, Parliament or the Council - but the best compromises are always those in which none of the parties can consider themselves to be one hundred per cent victorious.
It seems to me that the European Parliament's most important success is the resolute position on passenger rights, and another gain is the term 'basic passenger's rights'- and it is particularly significant that this was achieved in relation to persons with special needs - as well as the achievement concerning the railway companies' liability for baggage.
Certainly, we can express regret that the increased rights are entering into force in a limited way, and also at that fact that the entire package of additional passenger's rights in cities and on regional routes will, in the majority of countries, not be guaranteed for 15 years at the earliest.
I am glad that competition is coming to international rail transport from 2010, according to Mr Jarzembowski's report, but even though a further step has been taken on internal transport, and there is at least a clear procedure under which the Commission must carry out analysis, this decision was not adopted with any deadline.
Similarly, I regret two aspects: the first is that a few countries that are Member States, including my own country, Latvia, in fact have no international passenger rail connection with EU countries at all.
As a whole, the operation of the entire package in the European Union is, as a result, partially restricted: it does not operate across the whole of the enlarged European Union and some Member States are, overall, little affected.
A second point that I certainly regret is that it was not possible to achieve improvements on the issue of freight with regard to the quality of transport.
I hope that this will happen in the future.
I will end, though, as I began, with a positive thought - we have achieved a result, and particularly with regard to passenger rights it is undoubtedly a positive one.
Thank you.
<D>
I would like to make several statements at the beginning of this part-session.
On 6 November 2010 in Moscow, unknown assailants inflicted a savage beating on the journalist Oleg Kashin.
This brutal assault, which was not motivated by robbery, deserves the most severe condemnation.
We note and welcome the swift reaction of President Medvedev in this situation and his personal commitment to finding the perpetrators, and we hope this will be effective.
Secondly, on 31 October, and for the first time in two years, an opposition demonstration was held in Triumph Square in Moscow without the police intervening.
We take this as a promising signal from the Russian authorities, in the hope that the appeals of the European Parliament made over the years for further democratisation of public life in Russia have not gone unheeded.
Thirdly, 10 days ago in Baghdad, an attack was made on Christians who were at prayer in their church.
Some people were killed, and others were injured.
On behalf of the European Parliament, I reiterate my call for respect for freedom of religion and for an end to the religiously motivated violence which is being witnessed in this part of the world.
Fourthly, on 10 December, a ceremony will be held in Stockholm to award this year's Nobel Prizes.
We consider unacceptable the attempts made by the Chinese authorities to put pressure on Member States of the European Union not to participate in the ceremony.
The European Parliament strives unremittingly for the fundamental and inalienable rights of every person throughout the world to be respected, and we do not, of course, make exceptions for China.
At the ceremony in December, the head of the European Union delegation in Norway will represent the European Union and, therefore, the European Parliament too.
<D>
Today's vote in the European Parliament is vitally important.
The maximum working time in Europe will remain at 48 hours, which will allow countries that have a regime that is more favourable to workers not to change anything (such as France, which has 35 hours).
The Council wanted to increase this limit to 65 hours.
The forces of the left and those who defend workers, such as the European Trade Union Confederation, can be proud of this victory.
Doctors and medical students must not be forgotten, since this victory is also for them.
On-call time for medical staff will continue to be counted as working time.
This vote, having received a large majority, will allow 27 MEPs to assert their position loud and clear to the 27 Ministers in the Conciliation Committee.
<D>
Madam President, 14 February, St Valentine's Day, will mark the first ever European Epilepsy Day.
St Valentine himself is reputed to have been a sufferer from epilepsy.
Currently six million Europeans suffer from epilepsy.
In Scotland this is around 39 000 people, yet just 20 000 Scots have been diagnosed and control their condition with medication.
This means that 19 000 people live on a daily basis with the fear of a recurring seizure.
Extrapolated across the EU this means millions of people also live with this fear.
On 14 February we must raise awareness of epilepsy.
We must also try to get those who have the condition properly diagnosed and call on Member States to have more neurologists who have a specialism in epilepsy.
On 15 February there will be a number of events in Parliament and I encourage colleagues to take part.
Many of your constituents will be present.
I would also like to take the opportunity to welcome Joanne Hill, a specialist nurse in epilepsy, and Fiona Nicholson, the service manager of a Scottish epilepsy centre.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Well, my colleague Stavros Dimas has already replied to a supplementary question on this issue.
Basically, nuclear energy is established in a way that means that each country has a nuclear safety regulator who has full responsibility for implementing nuclear safety measures.
At the same time, each Member State decides whether or not to use nuclear energy.
This is subject to the Euratom Treaty, and very clearly there are additional requirements.
The additional requirements are that each project that is submitted is also analysed by the Commission and we make a recommendation on the projects to be developed.
We did that in the case of Belene and also of Mochovce.
There is also a clear obligation that the requirements of the environmental impact assessment should be fulfilled, as laid down in Community law, and the additional requirements of the UN/ECE Espoo Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary Context will also be applicable.
So whatever project is being proposed, we are not discriminating between Member States.
There are clear requirements to be fulfilled and each project is analysed on its own merits, based on the Community acquis and on environmental legislation.
I can assure you that this process is so watertight that no permission has ever been given to build a nuclear power installation unless all the safety requirements can be guaranteed.
<D>
in writing. - (RO) This directive represents an ambitious initiative, by which the aviation sector could play an important role in the fight against climate change.
Negotiations for this compromise have been difficult because they had to take into consideration the oil price, the competitiveness of European airlines and environmental protection, attempting to create a model system on the international scene for including aviation into the ETS.
Nevertheless, the system should not endanger precisely the European airlines, which could lose their competitiveness in relation to the competing aviation sector in the US or Dubai.
Penalizing the internal aviation industry will cause the occurrence of the "carbon leakage” phenomenon, namely the orientation towards markets with less strict rules than those imposed by the EU, thus starting a commercial war.
We need to find a balance between environmental protection, consumer protection and the aviation sector if we want the European airspace to be more efficient.
Also, revenues from auctioning allowances shall have to be used for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adjusting to climate change, without giving the possibility to Member States to use such money for other purposes.
If we manage to correctly use such revenues from auctions and only as an environmental instrument, we will avoid penalties under an international agreement.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - First of all, I can again only express my sympathy with all the people that have been hit by the consequences of the fires.
I think it is important to say that the single farm payment - the direct payment to the farmers - is not at risk.
The possible destruction of the crops, of animals or of buildings, has no consequence on the decoupled payment since there is no obligation to produce.
As regards cross compliance, one important rule is that the reduction of direct CAP payments under cross compliance can only be decided as a result of actions or omissions directly attributed to the farmer.
Therefore, forest fires like the ones we saw in Greece this summer would not result in the reduction of payments.
As far as wine is concerned, in the event of partial destruction, vineyards could be eligible within the restructuring scheme, under the current Regulation, and within the national envelopes that will be foreseen for the new CMO.
The reformed CMO for fruit and vegetables foresees new crisis prevention and management tools.
However, this new regulation will only be in place from 2008, and there is no retroactive clause.
As for the last question, the financial rules do not allow the Commission to transfer possible savings from the market organisation budget to specific national programmes to support Greek farmers.
Concerning the specific question on non-governmental organisations, monasteries or environmental bodies, the Commission does not have the possibility to directly support these for the purpose of environmental restoration activities.
European Union assistance is only possible through specifically designed programmes and interventions which are drawn up by Member States following the principle of subsidiarity and submitted to the Commission for co-financing.
I want just to mention some specific possibilities in our rural development policy which could be used to help as well.
I referred to these in my previous reply.
The first option concerns the programme 2000-2006, and can involve modification of the programme complements of national operational programmes and the regional operational programmes in order to reconstruct agricultural potential after national disaster measures.
This can, for example, mean that a farmer can get money for buying cattle, fruit and olive trees or to restore buildings that have been destroyed.
However, I have to repeat very strongly that it is not possible, via rural development policy, to compensate farmers for lost income.
The second option is the new rural development programme 2007-2013, which includes measures for restoring agricultural production potential, as well as forestry potential, following natural disasters.
It must be noted that interventions through these two options would be limited to reforestation and reconstruction of production potential, and again cannot be used to compensate for loss of income.
I want to conclude with the possibilities that will be available within state aid schemes.
A disaster like the forest fires in Greece would normally be considered exceptional occurrences, which actually allows Member States to grant support to compensate for material damage.
Nationally funded assistance to agriculture and forestry may be given following notification of a state aid scheme, and is subsequent to approval by the Commission.
I would also remind you that there is a much easier possibility, which is to use what we call de minimis state aid, which means that Member States can pay farmers, with the new changes that have taken place, EUR 6 000 - and you can do that every three years.
So, without asking anyone, you can actually pay direct to the farmer up to EUR 6 000 to help immediately, if necessary.
<D>
As they deal with the same subject, the following questions will be taken together:
Subject: Railway accident in Buizingen and electronic safety system
The serious railway accident in Buizingen, Belgium, on 15 February 2010, is being blamed on the absence of an electronic safety system which automatically applies trains' brakes if they pass a red light.
In addition to the national automatic train protection (ATP) systems, which have existed for years in some Member States, work is proceeding apace on the introduction of ERTMS (European Rail Traffic Management System) in Europe.
To what extent and for how long have the various Member States been equipping their railway lines and trains with national ATP systems?
What is the state of play with the introduction of ERTMS in the various Member States (both on trains and on railway lines)?
In the case of Member States which do not yet have national train protection systems, is it still worthwhile to invest in them, in view of the ongoing introduction of ERTMS and the major investment involved in a changeover?
How is the danger averted that railway infrastructure may be equipped with ERTMS but the trains may not, or vice versa?
Does this problem arise at present, for example for intercity railway traffic on the Liège-Aachen line?
What lessons should we perhaps learn here with regard to the liberalisation of the railways in Europe?
Subject: Causes of the dreadful train crash on Monday, 15 February in Buizingen
Can the Commission demonstrate whether liberalisation has affected safety?
In June 2008, the Commission sent Belgium a reasoned opinion formally criticising the complex three-part structure of Belgian Railways.
Have the requisite measures since been taken in response to the objections raised by the Commission?
How?
Since when has the European ERTMS standard been available?
Did any delay occur in comparison with the scheduled date of introduction?
If so, what were the causes of this delay and what remedial action has the Commission taken?
Did the debate on the European standard prevent the railways from introducing a system of their own to guarantee safety on domestic routes?
Since when have the specifications for such national systems been available?
In how many of the EU-27 countries does a national system already exist, and since when has it done so?
Which countries score best?
What is Belgium's position in relation to the EU-27 regarding safety of the railway network?
<D>
Mr President, I would like to thank you and all those Members who took part in this debate regarding a temporary measure - and I would emphasise that temporary nature - in the field of air transport.
Most importantly, I too would like to thank all those who are leaving Parliament for the work they have done.
(FR) I should also like to thank Mr Savary, who is no longer in the Chamber.
I share his sentiment; I therefore hope to work with him again in the years to come, even if he is no longer an MEP.
(IT) I sincerely thank those Members who are leaving the House for the help they have given the Commission, for their intelligent comments and also for the criticism they have offered.
Parliament should fulfil this role, and no one is more convinced of this than I am, because I believe that, without Parliament's strong input, the European institutions would be incomplete and unable to provide the best protection for citizens' interests.
For precisely that reason I would like to reassure Mr Jarzembowski, who asked me a question about the comitology procedure: the compromise, which has the Commission's full support, provides for the use of codecision procedure as regards possible renewal for the winter season.
This is purely hypothetical, because, I would emphasise, the measure is a temporary one and applies for six months only.
Nonetheless, any future proposal for renewal must always be preceded by an impact assessment, taking account of the effects on consumers and on competition.
It will also form part of a general review of the slots regulation, to which I have made a commitment before the Council, at the request of the UK transport minister, as I have confirmed many times in this House.
It is, however, the crisis that prompts this urgent intervention.
Indeed, data provided by the European Airport Association tells us that 80% of European airports have seen a reduction in traffic, in January, between 8% and 10% as regards passengers, and between 25% and 30% as regards freight.
This is therefore a difficult situation.
I, too, share the hope and wish expressed by certain Members that the current influenza will turn out to be less serious than it was initially believed to be.
We cannot hide the fact, though, that the proposal to suspend flights from the entire European Union to a country or to areas where the epidemic first broke out was on the agenda at last week's meeting of the Council of Transport Ministers, as well as the Council of Health Ministers.
There could be repercussions, therefore, but no decision was taken since the situation was not deemed serious enough.
However, it is clear that there is debate in this sector; some crews have decided not to fly to areas with known cases of influenza, which has caused a further drop in air passenger numbers.
I believe that as regards passenger rights - since it is a subject highlighted by many influential Members - the main thing is to maintain connections and frequency for the benefit precisely of citizens, and then to overcome the crisis.
The financial soundness and sustainability of our airlines are key parameters to safeguarding the advantages of the internal market, and thanks to the internal market passengers have access to a variety of connections, routes and prices unprecedented in Europe.
I want passengers to be able to continue to enjoy this possibility of choice.
As regards the regulations on supervision, we must strengthen the monitoring and application of Regulation 261.
To this end, the Commission will publish - let me address this to Mr Rack - a communication on the application of the regulation in the second half of 2009.
On the basis of this evaluation we will draw conclusions as to the future.
With regard to liquids, as you know, we have already published the formerly secret annex behind this, and thanks to the use of new and more effective technologies from the point of view of security, we hope to be able to review the situation before 2010.
I was highly sceptical of the liquids affair when I was an MEP, I remain so today and I am working precisely in order to reach that objective.
As regards the concerns expressed by other Members over certain airports that could run into problems following this measure - I refer in particular to a European airport that forms part of one of the EU's priority projects, the Malpensa airport - I can offer some information concerning airlines other than Alitalia-Air France.
Let me read you some statistics: at Malpensa airport, a German airline, Lufthansa, had 8 741 slots in 2008 and on 24 March 2009 had 19 520, an increase in capacity of more than 100%.
Also at Malpensa, a low-cost airline, easyJet, had 15 534 slots in 2008 and on 24 March 2009 had 22 936, a significant rise representing a 47% increase in capacity.
It is also well known that the new airline Lufthansa Italia has plans, as we can read on the airline's own website, thus in the public domain, to expand its network with new flights from Milan to Rome and to the cities of Naples and Bari as well as other European cities - Barcelona, Brussels, Bucharest, Budapest, Lisbon, Madrid and Paris.
I can say then with absolute certainty that this measure will not cause any harm - and I say this as European Commissioner for Transport - to an airport and European hub like Malpensa, which is included in the Union's priority projects.
I would like to conclude by thanking Parliament again for this debate, confirming what I said in my earlier speech, in reply to Mr Jarzembowski, Mr Simpson and Mr Blokland, as regards the commitment I am making today as Commissioner for Transport - and I hope to be able to do so again as future Commissioner for Transport - concerning the codecision procedure for matters relating to the issue of slots.
Some of the ideas put forward, such as those included by the rapporteur in his initial amendments, deserve to be properly studied in the context of the future review of the regulation on the allocation of slots and - I repeat - the Commission staff, whom I thank again for the valuable contribution they have made in these weeks of difficult work, are willing to do this and are indeed in the process of drafting the new text.
At the same time, as stipulated in the amendment we are debating today, the Commission will watch carefully to see how the air sector crisis develops and will propose measures to address this as necessary and appropriate, attaching great importance to safeguarding passenger rights.
I will do this not only in the field of air transport but also in maritime, rail and bus and coach transport.
This is a commitment we have made: there are legislative measures being discussed.
I hope that the next parliamentary term can bring these to a conclusion, as our primary objective nonetheless remains to meet the needs of the people who elect this Parliament and who, through the consensus of this Parliament, rely on the European Commission, the Community executive.
Mr President, may I also thank you, Mr Costa, and all those Members who have taken part in this debate, for their productive cooperation.
The commitment I am making is to continue to work with Members of this House and with its Committee on Transport and Tourism to ensure that the democratic institution representing European citizens can play an increasingly influential role.
I hope that with the Treaty of Lisbon the next Parliament will be able to make the voice of the European people heard more clearly.
<D>
Mr President, you will have to excuse the fact that I have lost my voice.
I wish to state that I voted in favour of this interpretation and I want to say that Mr Hannan's comparison, while pretending not to make it, of our vote with Hitler's Ermächtigungsgesetz of 1933 was an absolutely disgraceful comparison.
But such a ludicrous comparison just shows the state of mind of the person making it.
We have simply confirmed, in accordance with our rules, that Rule 19 of our Rules of Procedure already gives the President of Parliament the right to bring an end to successive uses of points of order, procedural motions etc., 'where the President is convinced that these are manifestly intended to cause and will result in a prolonged and serious obstruction of the procedures of the House or the rights of other Members'.
This is not stifling debate.
We have ample speaking time in debates, shared out proportionally to every group in accordance with their size.
This is simply a safeguard against those who are trying to disrupt this House.
The powers that our President has are far less than what exists in most national parliaments, if you take the Speaker of the House of Commons, for instance.
We are right to take that safeguard measure, and I note that the former leader of Mr Hannan's party, a member of our committee, actually voted in favour of that, so his attitude is disgraceful.
<D>
As the author is not present, Question No 7 lapses.
Subject: Bluefin tuna fishing in the Mediterranean
On 11 June 2007 the Council adopted Regulation (EC) No 643/2007amending Regulation (EC) No 41/2006 as concerns the recovery plan for bluefin tuna recommended by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas.
However, the text does not respect the principle of equal treatment for bluefin tuna fishermen in the European Union.
The rules governing the minimum weight of fish caught and the fishing periods differ according to the geographical areas of the catches.
What are the reasons for such disparities in the way Mediterranean and East Atlantic fishermen are treated?
The restrictions imposed on French bluefin tuna fishermen in the Mediterranean could seriously disrupt the sector's socioeconomic balance.
Above the 30 kg limit imposed by the new Regulation, tuna are hard to sell.
A two-week reduction in the fishing season means a significant drop in turnover for fishermen.
Around one thousand fishermen and their families are directly affected by these measures.
In what way is bluefin tuna fishing more harmful in the Mediterranean than in the East Atlantic?
<D>
(DE) Madam President, I would like start by thanking Mr Vondra and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner most warmly for their contributions, which were much more realistic and, in our view, more to the point than Mr Onyszkiewicz's report in its current form, which I find very regrettable, as I hold Mr Onyszkiewicz in very high regard on a personal level.
I therefore do not entirely understand why we have a report before us that does not use this common basis - criticism on the one hand and willingness to cooperate on the other - as a denominator, as the Council and the Commission have done.
Let me run through our criticisms once again, by which I mean our criticisms of Russia, just to be clear.
In terms of the neighbourhood, we do not understand, and are critical of, Russia's behaviour towards Georgia, but the world has long been aware that Russia is not the only guilty part here.
The only thing is that certain circles here do not want to accept that.
We have to see both sides.
When I look from Mrs Zourabichvili to Mrs Burjanadze, at how former allies of the President of Georgia are now in opposition to President Saakashvili and how human rights are not exactly prized very highly there either, I do ask myself why it is only Russia that is criticised, and not Georgia as well.
As for the energy crisis involving Ukraine, we are now well aware, and you know this as well as we do, that Ukraine, and its internal political situation, has to bear some of the responsibility, but it is always Russia alone that is criticised.
Although Mr Horáček, who now apparently wants to solve the governmental crisis in the Czech Republic, says here that we should not prioritise the energy issue over human rights, nobody is actually doing that.
Tell me, specifically, do you now want us to say 'we do not want your gas until you respect human rights'?
You must say openly, honestly and clearly what you want, and not just throw soundbites into the discussion.
My third point relates to human rights.
We are bitterly disappointed at the attitude to human rights in Russia; certainly, we find it unacceptable.
We will never remain silent when human rights are being abused.
As I have just said, we must address human rights abuses clearly wherever they occur, be this in Georgia, Russia, or our own Member States.
This includes the rights of Russian citizens or non-citizens, some of whom, unfortunately, face problems in certain EU Member States.
That goes without saying, but we must do it to the same extent everywhere; to the same extent and with the same criteria.
Fourthly, I am deeply saddened that Russia - and its leadership - is not developing the kind of perspective of its own history that many of our own countries have developed.
I am referring here to the debate we have already had, and to tomorrow's vote on the resolution on history.
Russia's image would be hugely improved if it took a more critical approach to its own history, in other words if it depicted Stalinism not as a major national achievement, but as a crime that it needs to confront.
Of course, there have also been very clear statements on our part, but we have to say, for all countries, for all totalitarian regimes, that we are not prepared to accept totalitarian regimes, and not prepared to accept a lack of engagement with history.
It may therefore still be an option, if at least one or two of our side's proposed amendments are accepted, which attempt to restore the balance and to pursue precisely this dual strategy: major criticism of Russia, but also a willingness to enter into partnership with Russia.
<D>
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at a time when Europe is facing difficulties, with rising doubts and declining enthusiasm, we are about to celebrate an undeniable success, the 40th anniversary of the Customs Union.
Between 1968 and 2008, customs have served as an example of resourcefulness and adaptability.
You may remember the closing of border controls between Member States in 1993.
Customs authorities managed to redeploy their forces and to do so in a modern way.
They have a complex role to play because they have to respond to global challenges.
While ensuring that the European Union and its citizens are secure, while ensuring that the logistical chain is secure, they must also maintain the right balance between controls and facilitating legitimate trade with a view to improving Europe's competitiveness.
In order to succeed in their task, customs managed to readjust radically thanks to a new customs code that is both simpler and more far-reaching as a result of the new technologies that will provide them with a paperless administrative environment, and also as a result of cooperation.
That cooperation, which underpins the customs union, must apply as much to international bodies such as the WTO and the WCO as to the new administrations and industries.
The results of that cooperation are particularly evident in seizures of counterfeits.
Unfortunately, there are limits to international cooperation and at present we can only deplore the US Congress's unilateral decision on 100% scanning of container cargo in EU ports.
Customs need our support in order to engage in realistic discussions.
We must listen carefully to the initiatives that have been announced in the strategy for the future of customs union and be prepared to support any measure that will make them even more efficient, especially in combating counterfeiting and organised crime.
(The President cut off the speaker.)
<D>
in writing. - The Catania report on the situation of fundamental rights in the European Union in the years 2004-2008 stresses the need to protect the rights of minorities, to fight all discrimination against all vulnerable categories.
I welcome this report which includes important elements drawn from Written Declaration 111 on ending street homelessness, which was adopted by the European Parliament in April 2008.
I particularly welcome the report's call for the introduction of winter emergency plans for the homeless, for a framework definition of homelessness and for the gathering of reliable statistical data on homelessness across the EU.
Ending street homelessness is a fundamental issue in the European Union.
This report is an additional step towards pushing the European Council, Commission and Member States to act on homelessness.
Finally, the Treaty of Lisbon will not advance the situation concerning fundamental rights in the EU.
Support for this report does not imply support for that Treaty.
In fact, the European Parliament's refusal to respect the Irish No vote runs contrary to the spirit of the Charter.
<D>
Mr President, thank you, Commissioner, and thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your very good input.
I would like to say in advance that sovereignty over water resources must remain a national matter.
Nevertheless, we need to demonstrate solidarity, although this solidarity must be voluntary.
Many good and very detailed suggestions were put forward by Members.
I took only some of them into account, for the simple reason that this was an own-initiative report that had to remain relatively general and illustrate general principles.
I am very much looking forward to seeing the paper that the Commission will present, hopefully in the next few weeks - that is, the Green Paper on adaptation to climate change, which we are all impatiently waiting for, because we all know that the 'Adaptation and Climate Change' section relates primarily to water.
We are eagerly waiting to see what concrete suggestions the Commission has to make.
I would like to remind you that from our point of view, 'mainstreaming' is extremely important.
It is vital for water policy to be included in all other areas of policy and politics, as my colleague Mr Berend has also pointed out.
European funds must not be used in ways that contribute to short- or long-term water scarcity.
Everyone must realise - and we must raise awareness of this in the political and economic world, but also amongst citizens - that water is not an infinite resource.
My colleague Mrs Doyle mentioned water pricing.
It is very clear: Article 9 must be implemented, but here the Member States have a wide scope and the necessary flexibility, and their traditions must be taken into account.
I support the measures on the demand side, too, although the supply side must also be taken into account, as our Spanish fellow Member said.
There are special situations where these, too, simply have to be solved via the supply side.
In summary, I would like to thank everyone most sincerely for the stimulating debate.
<D>
(PT) Mr President, in the negotiations with the Council on the 2011 budget, the European Parliament did everything in order for agreement to be reached.
The only demand is to fulfil the Council's undertakings, for example, the Europe 2020 strategy and the need to finance it, and to comply with the Treaty of Lisbon.
In truth, under the treaty, the European Parliament has to be involved - by voting, giving opinions, or being consulted - in the new interinstitutional agreement, in the next multiannual financial framework and in establishing new own resources.
These demands are logical, reasonable, in the public interest, and in the interests of preventing interinstitutional risks and conflicts: they are demands that the Council should share and uphold.
As regards the interinstitutional agreement, it is obvious that respect for the commitments made by European institutions, specifically the Council, is conditional on the existence of flexibility regarding the current multiannual financial framework.
The Europe 2020 strategy, the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor programme, the European External Action Service and the financial supervision entities are some examples of things that need financing.
The Council needs to take the Treaty of Lisbon on board, both from the point of view of the areas newly under the jurisdiction of the European Union, which are reflected in the budget, and from the point of view of the European Parliament's strengthened powers, not least regarding the budget.
These changes in fact strengthen the democratic legitimacy of the Union's institutions.
The use of the Community method rather than the intergovernmental approach makes our governance more democratic.
I hope that a few national egos do not obstruct the European project of peace, solidarity and progress, or put it at risk.
<D>
(HU) Madam President, Commissioner, we have taken an enormous step this past year, because establishing a common energy policy represents an enormous step for the whole of the European Union.
We are talking about the kind of energy policy that simultaneously promotes the strategic interests of the EU Member States, the rights and protection of Europe's residents, competitiveness and growth of the European economy, and conservation of our environment.
These five proposals raise the prospect of achieving the kind of market integration which will not only transform the way in which companies in the energy sector operate, and separate and increase the transparency of energy generation, transmission and supply functions, but also give greater priority than ever before to the fundamental rights and protection of energy consumers.
In the context of European coordination, the task of monitoring fair market competition, stimulating cross-border energy trading, and ensuring that high standards are met in response to consumer demands must be given to an authority invested with broader powers than hitherto, and which is independent both of governments and of the energy sector.
This is why the European legislature has moved decisively towards establishing an Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators.
The draft report produced by my fellow Member Mr Brunetta and later taken over by Mr Chichester has this as its aim.
I was pleased to have the opportunity of working with them as shadow rapporteur representing the Socialist Group in the European Parliament (PSE).
I consider it a great success that, by establishing a responsible, independent and strong European agency, this jointly-produced draft regulation will not only promote cooperation among regulators in the Member States but also help to achieve the primary goal of fostering regional markets and developing the networks.
As socialists we insisted on the creation of a strong and independent authority, since we know that in a liberalised European market everyone wants to buy where it is cheapest, and to sell where it is most expensive.
We therefore really need the kind of regulatory authority that will take action to combat any market distortions that may occur.
It is in the interests of Hungary and of all the other small Member States to create a strong authority, thereby helping to ensure its independence, establish cooperation, enhance market transparency and secure investment for development.
Mr President, I would like to remind everyone that European energy supply is not an ideological issue.
The world has changed for ever.
Whole continents are beginning to compete in the energy sector, and let us be candid about it: no one can remain isolated from electricity or motorisation.
The goal of energy policy is to ensure Europe's supply security and competitiveness.
I would nevertheless like to conclude by saying that the PSE Group believes that consumers should be treated as the key component of European energy policy.
We very much regret that our conservative fellow Members do not support making the Consumer Charter mandatory.
Thank you for your attention.

To my mind, the Feio report is the most professional report we have had in the last three months.
All the issues and solutions detailed in the report are extremely timely.
The lack of information, distorted reporting and, occasionally, downright lies from EU states' governments, has led to dreadful results.
By fearfully concealing the glaring gaps in their budgets, Greece, Latvia and Hungary have shaken confidence in the euro.
The European Commission and the European Parliament must strictly and effectively react to any distortion of the facts and concealment of the truth.
It is essential to draw up measures in respect of dishonest politicians, on whose account the EU has ended up in crisis.
In order to come out of this complicated economic situation, we must draw up not only regulations for supervision and statistics, but also a plan for overcoming the crisis.
That means, firstly, clear criteria for fiscal policy, and deadlines and guarantees for taxpayers.
We must also ensure that this tax legislation not be amended every day at a nod from investors.
Unfortunately, today, the Latvian Government amends its regulations as the mood of the officials from the International Money Fund and the European Bank takes them.
I hope that the Feio report will act as a signal to the European Commission that the time for getting down to work has come.
<D>
(FR) Mr President, I am very sorry to hear the consequences of the earthquake in your country.
(SK) I would like to applaud the work of Mary Honeyball on the early years learning report.
I can sense from the text the effort that has been made to overcome ideological prejudices and find a compromise across the political spectrum.
This is right and proper, as it involves the family and the well-being of children.
Parents have the main responsibility for raising and educating their children.
This is also confirmed by the references made by the rapporteur to the articles of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.
The responsibility of parents is also mentioned in the General Declaration of Human Rights - parents have a preferential right to choose the type of education for their children.
I also share the belief that investment in education and in early years learning will bring a return in future prosperity.
There is evidence that children already develop the foundations of responsibility, understanding and social behaviour in their early years.
The report also emphasises that caring for young people is the best way to prevent future juvenile criminality.
I go into these factors in greater depth in the report prepared on the contribution made to the fight against juvenile criminality by policies on gender equality and parental responsibility.
Just like the rapporteur, I, too, am opposed to artificially increasing the percentage of women on the labour market at any price.
Many mothers would prefer to care for their young children rather than have formal employment.
They do not have the freedom to choose, however, as society places little if any value on the work of women in the home and in caring for children.
The submitted report contains no proposals for states to place a financial value on the work of mothers in raising and educating children, at least in proportion to the contributions states make to the running of pre-school facilities.
The report as a whole is a step in the right direction, and future social developments will oblige us to pay more attention to this topic.
<D>
(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, yes, a reform of the COM in wine is desirable, but are the means put forward by the Commission the most suitable?
From the Brussels viewpoint, we can understand the mathematical equation between a decrease in production and a decrease in the number of producers, but from the viewpoint of south-west France, the plains of Italy, the Spanish or Portuguese coasts, Commissioner, I can assure you that it is not the same thing, and this is an issue which should not be observed through the prism of the economist's spectacles.
Winemaking means men and women who live off the fruit of their labours.
Vines are their livelihood, and we cannot push them towards the exit door without concerning ourselves as to what they will do for a living.
Moreover, what is the logic in grubbing-up, on the one hand, and on the other suggesting the total liberalisation of planting rights as of 2013?
My second question is as follows: why eliminate this regulatory tool when we have no assurances as to how the market will evolve?
If we really want to fight overproduction, I suggest we order illegal plantings to be grubbed up first.
For you know as well as I do that there are quite a few of these in Europe.
The report also makes provision for a greater variety of measures accessible through the national support programmes.
This is a good thing, because the Commission's proposal on this point is extremely restrictive.
I therefore regret the insufficiency of the section dealing with crisis prevention.
We know how liable wine production is to yearly variations depending on weather conditions, and crisis prevention measures will only help to mitigate the fluctuations.
I wish to conclude by saying that I understand the rapporteur's caution on enrichment, which is a sensitive issue, but it is regrettable that authorisation has not been proposed to combine additive and subtractive enrichment methods, which would allow producers to reduce their use of sucrose.
As for the rest of the report, the general approach appears to be going in the right direction, and I will support the rapporteur's excellent work.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - (CS) Mr President, the Commission's communication on flexicurity has triggered an important and useful discussion throughout the Union.
I thank the rapporteur, Mr Christensen, and the other Members who have taken an active part in discussing flexicurity.
Thanks to your efforts and cooperation with the other parliamentary committees, the European Parliament will be able to adopt a resolution that will significantly support the approach that the Commission has proposed.
In our society, security depends on change.
Now we must coordinate ways to seek new forms of security: better skills, the ability to find new jobs, modern protective measures adapted to the new labour market.
In recent years, for every job that has been lost in Europe in the industrial sector, four new jobs have been created in other sectors.
The most important question is how to gain control over these shifts and how to manage this change successfully.
We must also pose the question of the reasons for labour market segregation in a number of Member States.
I very much welcome the report that you are considering today.
This report recognises that flexicurity can be a strategy for labour market reform.
The text also supports the four-part policy structure formulated for flexicurity by the Commission.
I can also fully support the proposal relating to common principles mentioned in paragraph 15 of this report.
Your proposals take approximately the same direction as the proposals made by the Commission in its own communication.
I understand your desire for some issues, such as measures to combat insecurity, to be explained more precisely.
However, I believe that the principles must be concise and that they must be viewed from the standpoint of the whole communication.
I would also like to welcome the European social partners' agreement with the analysis of labour market problems; their analysis was presented at the recent Tripartite Social Summit in Lisbon on 18 October 2007 and, among other things, also looked at flexicurity.
This agreement indicates that social dialogue can bring concrete results.
Indeed, you have referred to this joint analysis in your motion for a resolution.
Now I would like to reply to some of the critical views expressed in your report.
I know you go on to say that discussion about flexicurity should be more balanced.
First of all I would like to remind you that the Commission's communication is the result of intensive dialogue between all the stakeholders and careful consultation with leading specialists in this field.
I am convinced that the Commission's approach is balanced, since the objective is to support flexibility and security simultaneously and, as has already been said, as two elements that are synergetic and in no way inconsistent.
It is obvious that discussion of flexicurity must not be misused to move towards labour market deregulation.
On the contrary, flexibility and mobility must aim higher: that is, towards better jobs, towards a better balance between work and family and private life, a more efficient economy as a whole.
As you know, in the next few weeks the Council will make a decision on common principles of flexicurity.
After that, national discussions scheduled by all the stakeholders will continue, making it possible to pursue flexicurity strategies at the national level with regard to the specific features of individual states.
I am confident that the individual stakeholders will ensure that a balanced approach can be achieved in the area of flexicurity.
As far as costs are concerned, it should be appreciated that the costs connected with a flexicurity policy are much lower than the concrete benefits in terms of a more dynamic labour market and reduced unemployment.
Moreover, in a number of instances, it will mean no increase in financial costs, but more efficient use of available resources instead.
I would also like to react to the paragraph of the report in which it is stated that the open-ended contract should form the basis of a social security system.
The Commission's intention is in no way to reduce the importance of the open-ended contract.
However, I believe that we should adopt more general systems of social security, which would apply both to open-ended contracts and to part-time employment: in short, the intention is that these forms of employment should also be provided with adequate social security cover, not that open-ended contracts should be weakened.
Mr President, I believe that, with the exception of these few reservations, the report is a useful, relevant contribution to the discussion about flexicurity, and once again I would like to thank the European Parliament for it.
<D>
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, the European Union will not guarantee the security of its Eastern border by ignoring the interests of Belarusians and Ukrainians.
We should support visits to the Union by the widest possible groups of people specifically from Ukraine and Belarus, and at the same time isolating the Lukashenka regime.
Democratic processes and the changes in the mentality of our Eastern neighbours, for example as far as their perceptions of NATO in Ukraine are concerned, will take place more quickly thanks to personal experiences of visits in the European Union countries.
At the moment Belarusians must pay EUR 60 for a visa.
This is equivalent of one third of average salary and precludes most of the society from visiting.
This situation suits the Lukashenka regime, since the more contacts with Western Europe are restricted, the easier it will be to control Belarusian society.
The visa requirement isolates the Belarusian youth and those people who have opposition sympathies.
The West should want to maintain contacts with these social groups.
Expensive visa charges lead only to an increase in the activity of the visa mafia and to other pathologies on the borders.
Such barriers also cause tangible losses to tourism in Poland.
Skiers from Ukraine and Belarus have visited Polish mountains in large numbers in recent years.
They have tended to arrive in early January, when the Orthodox Christmas begins.
By now Polish skiing resorts are empty.
Ladies and gentlemen, especially now, when at the NATO summit in Bucharest Vladimir Putin threatened to cause the break-up of Ukraine and stated that, and I quote, 'Ukraine is not even a state, and one part of its territory is Eastern Europe and another - a large one - was gifted to it by Russia', a clear signal is needed that the European Union will not tolerate such threats against its nearest neighbour in international politics.
I appeal for the fastest possible commencement of a dialogue on specific actions so that the Ukrainians will not require EU visas.
I wish to state clearly that a real vision of a contemporary and safe Europe is not possible without Ukraine.
<D>
One of the main aims of the European Union within the framework of a policy for a common area of freedom, security and justice is ensuring the security of its 500 million citizens.
To achieve this, the European Union and its states must face up to modern terrorism.
The most controversial issue in the content of the proposal to revise the Council framework decision on combating terrorism is the demand for the introduction of the concept of public provocation to commit terrorist offences.
There is a very fine line between freedom of speech and breaking the law.
We cannot allow a situation to develop where increasing security causes a restriction of citizens' rights and freedoms.
For this reason I take the position that it is indispensable to ensure the highest possible legal level for the framework decision under discussion, and this should primarily be done through a tighter definition of the concept of public provocation to commit terrorist offences.
The newly created document must be clear and harmonious from a legal aspect in order to make it an effective instrument in combating terrorism, while at the same time providing a high level of human rights and fundamental freedoms.
<D>
I voted in favour of the report because we cannot weigh down our top facilities with an unsustainable administrative burden if we want our support for European research to be effective.
However, the text of the resolution and the debate on it have again confirmed my belief that public funds should be used to secure basic public services; other activities, including research and entrepreneurial activities, should be financed from private sources.
The role of this Parliament should be limited to two areas.
The first is the creation of a basic legislative framework to facilitate this type of business.
If we are asking in the resolution today for a simplification of the mechanisms and instruments used in the current system of public grants, we are solving the result and not the cause of the problem.
This is because public grants are the problem.
The second area is respect for the rights of EU Member States.
If some states ban the use of human embryos for research purposes, such research should not be financed from the common resources of the EU.
It is like taking money from a committed non-smoker and using it to subsidise tobacco cultivation.
I am in favour of simplifying support for research.
It seems to me that we should aim to create a favourable environment for those who want to invest in new technologies and innovations, rather than discussing eligible costs and accounting procedures.
<D>
Mr President, as others have said, this debate is undoubtedly important; indeed it has just been called historic, among other things because of the number of hours devoted to this work and because of the political debate that has led up to it.
I think it is a good thing that, amidst the commotion that has preceded this debate and to some extent surrounds it now.
I say commotion with all due respect for the contributions from civil society, NGOs and the national parliaments that are also involved.
In the midst of all this, it is important to understand why and how we have got to where we are today.
We need to understand that negotiating these association agreements with the ACP States is not a political decision taken at will by the European Union, as if it had various options on the table and chose this one rather than others.
It is essentially a legal requirement based on the rules of legality laid down by the World Trade Organisation.
It is a necessity born out of the circumstances surrounding our previous legal framework on trade with the countries of the ACP zone.
It should also be remembered, right here and now, that those who condemned the European Union's relations with the ACP States were precisely those other developing countries that had perfectly legitimate claims for access to our markets but had been left out, for the simple reason that they were not former colonies of current EU Member States.
Thus the European Union had, and still has to some extent, two yardsticks: one for its former colonies and another for other countries with a similar level of development that do not come under this system.
That is what became unsustainable and what those same countries made it their mission to emphasise within the World Trade Organisation.
Apart from anything else, we must consider that the system we are going to replace, first the Lomé Convention and then the arrangement based on the Cotonou Agreements, in no way achieved the desired results.
No one can claim that the Cotonou system was entirely satisfactory.
If it had been, the figures - the volume of EU trade with those countries - would be far higher than they are today.
Therefore we should not claim, either, that we are going to replace something that has yielded results, because that is not the case.
For all these reasons, these Economic Partnership Agreements should be seen as a great opportunity, particularly for all those of us who believe that the development and growth of these countries cannot depend solely on external aid.
Clearly, I refer especially to those countries that are party to these agreements but are not among the least-developed countries.
In this regard the concept of ownership, of taking control of one's own destiny and not depending exclusively on external aid, lies politically - and I may say philosophically - behind these partnership agreements.
In principle, my group therefore fully supports the negotiation of these agreements by the European Commission and the fact that they should be comprehensive and complete, covering not only goods but also services and the rules of competition; that they should be agreed as a whole.
Another thing to consider is, of course, how these negotiations and the specific topics that are on the table have been handled.
On this subject I would refer to what each of the rapporteurs said concerning the different areas, because we are talking about the overall approach, whereas, in fact, each negotiation is being dealt with separately.
There are some points outstanding and there are concerns - for instance, to mention just one example, the situation of the outermost regions, which merit specific attention in the case of the Cariforum - but, as a whole - I mean politically - we fully support both this negotiation and the need for it to continue and for Parliament to monitor this negotiation effectively.
One of the several amendments we have tabled states that parliamentary monitoring of this issue should be carried out uniformly and not in different ways depending on the country in question.
<D>
Thousands of new toys come on the market in Europe every year, and Christmas is the time when demand for toys in the shops is at its peak.
Therefore, this is a timely issue.
There are significant concerns regarding harmful chemicals found in certain toys.
The Commission must address this without delay.
Safety standards must be based on reliable methods of testing, and intensive research must be undertaken to ensure that no harmful substances are found in children's toys.
Although all the toys that appear on the market from 20 July 2011 onwards will have to comply with the new Toy Safety Directive, and although we in Europe have the world's strictest legislation as regards toy safety, constant care is necessary.
The Commission must be vigilant and strengthen the market surveillance of imports.
Every recall of dangerous toys is a cause for concern, and an immediate examination of each case must be made.
Consumers must have confidence in the CE mark which guarantees that a product is of EU standard and made from non-toxic materials.
<D>
Mr President, this Treaty is not an elegant document.
There are many 'ifs', 'buts' and 'maybes', because there is no other way for a diverse family of nations to share power.
However, despite the naysayers, it responds to our citizens' demands for more democracy and a greater capacity to do those things which nation states cannot do effectively on their own: peacekeeping, climate change, migration, financial and market regulation, and, indeed, labour regulation.
At this time of global instability, the European Union is more important than ever for small Member States like Ireland.
Today's vote will again show up the bizarre alliance of market fundamentalists, ultra-left and ultra-right, which opposes this Treaty.
They have one thing in common: an urge to confine peoples' democratic reach behind national borders.
The multimillionaires - the Murdochs in Britain and the Ganleys in Ireland - cynically manipulate national chauvinism to seek to deny Europeans reaching beyond their national borders to regulate business in the wider interests of society.
The others, Sinn Féin and their allies, do not trust the citizens and their ability to create an accountable transnational democracy.
Their stock-in-trade is fear, fear of our neighbours, of democratic parliaments, of governments and of globalisation.
They fail to explain how more power for parliaments means less democracy.
They masquerade as internationalists but they object to neighbours helping each other in times of crisis or attack.
They refuse to countenance binding European laws to protect us and our neighbours from climate change, the abuse of workers' rights and abuse of the market.
The weapons of those who pedal fear is the big lie, eloquently demonstrated here today by Ms McDonald and Ms Sinnott.
They wearily turn truth on its head to claim that elected representatives of more than 80% of the people of Europe are about to crush democracy, are about to deny people ever again having a say in the construction of Europe.
Before polling day in Ireland, all these big lies will have been shown up for what they are: the nightmares of parties which have learned nothing from their history and are bent on condemning the people of Europe to repeating it.
I am confident that Ireland's decision will be to stay at the heart of Europe.
<D>
The next item is the vote.
(For the results and other details on the vote: see Minutes)
I have an announcement to make.
Ms Eva Dudzinska is sitting to the right of me.
She has spent almost 35 years in the European Parliament.
For the last 10 years her activities have been closely linked to the plenary.
She is now retiring.
I would like to thank her and wish her all the best for the future.
(Applause)
<D>
The situation in Syria is deeply concerning.
We do not have complete, reliable information as the foreign press has been refused access.
However, the repressive measures carried out by the Assad regime are intensifying and have already resulted, based on the figures supplied by the NGOs, in the murder of 600-700 civilians and the arrest or disappearance of another 8 000 people.
Syria's citizens have been demonstrating for nearly two months and they must not be left on their own to fight for democracy.
Brutal repression is unacceptable and must be stopped.
The EU must take a leading role in the quest for a speedy solution.
This is why I would like to welcome the restrictive measures adopted by the Council against the Syrian regime at the start of the week.
However, we need to do more, in cooperation with the Union's partners, to urge the Syrian authorities to halt the repression.
Assad is isolated.
Only the Gaddafi regime is condemning at the moment 'the international conspiracy attacking Syria's national security', a statement which says a great deal about the situation in Syria.
Finally, I would like to stress that, in the current circumstances, Syria's application for a seat on the UN's Human Rights Council is unacceptable.
<D>
rapporteur. - Madam President, conceiving of the European Union as an area of freedom, security and justice would be nothing but a remarkable goal without the involvement of the already-established European agencies, whose capacities to act and react to combat organised cross-border crime should become stronger.
I should like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, with whom I have worked very well on nearly all aspects of this report, and also the President of Eurojust and his team for their openness during this process.
While drawing up this report, I heard many colleagues call for a European prosecutor.
In this respect, I am much more in favour of harmonisation and the setting-up of a European justice system than of reinforcing cooperation.
However, for a number of reasons we are, for the time being, still pretty far from such a goal: firstly, because there is no European legislation addressing the issue of jurisdiction in cases that are the competence of Eurojust; secondly, because of the reluctance shown by Member States even to transfer some of their investigative powers to a European agency.
The text on the possibility of Eurojust's national members being part of a joint investigation teams provides a good example.
It is a paradox that while the Members of the European Parliament are ready to truly address serious cross-border crime - including by granting more powers to Eurojust, with our major concern being respect for human rights - the Member States are preaching one thing but legislating in another.
It is difficult to explain to European citizens how we can establish an area of freedom, security and justice if Member States do not sufficiently trust our own European agencies.
We as a Parliament understand and agree with the fact that Eurojust must work 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs has also agreed that in order for Eurojust to be efficient it is essential for its national members to have the same judicial powers they enjoy in their own countries.
It also voted in favour of strengthening relations with Europol and the European judicial network, and of creating links with other European and international agencies, such as Frontex, Interpol and the World Customs Organisation.
What we as Members of this Parliament require - and the report is a reflection of this approach - is a proper balance between the powers of Eurojust and those of its national members, on the one hand, and the rights of the defendant, on the other.
That is why several of the amendments I have tabled aim to increase the level of protection of procedural rights, such as the right to defence, the right to a fair trial, the right to be informed and the right to judicial redress.
At the same time, although we are aware of the strong data-protection system established by the agency, several amendments represent additional safeguards.
However, a major concern still exists about data transmitted to third countries and international organisations, because the truth is that we do not know, in reality, what will happen to this data.
Therefore, in order to make sure that our own European standards are observed, I propose setting up an evaluation mechanism.
I should like to thank Commissioner Barrot for mentioning this.
Last but not least, I am concerned about the role that the European Parliament should play in relation to Eurojust.
Not knowing what the fate of the Lisbon Treaty will be makes things even more worrisome.
However, there is nothing in current Community law to prevent Parliament from playing an active role in supervising the activities of Eurojust.
It is entirely a matter of political will, and I truly hope that this House will be allowed to do its job.
<D>
Mr President, it is very clear in the motion for a resolution that we have had a Europe of excessive weather conditions, whether we consider the heat or the floods.
We have heard a great deal.
Obviously I, alongside my other colleagues, express my deepest sympathy for those who have suffered from the fires in Greece.
Equally there are those, as Mr Corbett mentioned, who have suffered from floods, which happens to be the case in my constituency.
I am surprised the Commissioner did not raise this.
After all, we are talking about natural catastrophes and that also includes floods.
We have had amongst the wettest months of June and July on record, in my country.
As a result, the Association of British Insurers reckons damages could be up to EUR 5 billion.
Ten lives have been lost, countless homes have been destroyed, countless businesses dislocated and infrastructure has been destroyed.
Therefore, it would be extremely important that floods are also included in any action which the Commission wishes to propose.
Commissioner, local people are asking questions such as: can the EU give grants which might be matched by national funding to prevent further flooding by building flood defences?
Secondly, should the EU review its directive which prevents the spoil from dredging rivers and streams being left on the banks of these rivers?
When we look at the estimates in the future, no one can doubt that these conditions will probably get worse.
Climatologists expect the national rainfall average to increase by something like 20%, which can fall in extreme torrential downpours when you get a month's rain within a day.
In this particular circumstance, it would be very satisfying for those who might be listening to the debates in my constituency, Mr Corbett's constituency or across the UK, that you can assure them that the floods will be included, as we stated in paragraph 2 of the motion for a resolution from our group, and that the aid will be given as soon and as expeditiously as possible.
As general rapporteur of the 2007 budget, I can assure you that I will be keeping a very close eye to make sure that the funds are properly and efficiently spent.
<D>
The report as a whole: 'We Danish Social Democrats have chosen to vote against the report on the EU's agricultural policy after 2013, as we do not believe that it properly expresses the desire for an otherwise much needed reform.
We would have liked to have seen the EU leading the way and stopping all payments of export subsidies by 2013 at the latest - irrespective of the actions of the other WTO trade partners.
This was not included in the report.
In connection with the payment of subsidies, we would have liked higher requirements to be set for the environment, climate and sustainability than the unambitious requirements that are in place today.
This was not included in the report.
We would also have liked to have seen a significant reduction in the proportion of the EU budget being allocated to agricultural aid.
This was not included in the report either.
In light of this, we Danish Social Democrats are unable to support the final report on the EU's agricultural aid after 2013.'
Amendment 3: 'We Danish Social Democrats believe that EU subsidies should be removed from European agricultural policy.
Free and fair trade should be the guiding principle for an agricultural area based on sustainability.
We voted against this amendment, as we believe that the amendment itself is contradictory, as it calls for EU aid to be provided without distorting free and fair trade.
However, the distortion of free and fair trade is precisely what the EU's subsidy schemes are doing today.'
<D>
- (EL) Mr President, let me congratulate the rapporteurs on their thorough examination of the topic.
However, I must point out that if one of our basic aims is to create an area of peace, we must pay attention to the political future of the countries in question.
Let me cite Egypt as an example.
Do any of us know what will happen in the post-Mubarak era?
I fear not.
Do we not realise that sooner or later Egypt will be taken over by the Muslim Brotherhood, a large Islamic extremist organisation?
We must therefore understand that all our planning in the area will be undermined by such a situation.
I do not want to repeat here, yet again, the proposal I made last year in the previous debate on the report.
I suggested the creation of a commonwealth among these countries in order to strengthen relations in the political neighbourhood.
Allow me to end by pointing out that the European political neighbourhood was promoted in tandem with the accession of the Ten, with the aim of mitigating the formation of new lines of division with neighbouring countries.
For this reason, the European political neighbourhood must remain unified, geographically cohesive and balanced between its eastern and southern parts.
In addition, since the countries making up the European political neighbourhood display political, economic and even cultural differences, the principle of diversity is as ever crucially important, but it must not be used to widen the gaps between these countries.
<D>
(PL) Mr President, the posting of workers is indissolubly linked to the freedom to provide services.
By its decision, the Court of Justice supported this, in my view, supremely important principle of the common market.
I would, however, like to express my disenchantment with the fact that regulations still exist in the Community market that are out of line with the Posting of Workers Directive.
Let us not forget that the Directive is aimed at helping both workers and contractors.
Situations in which key provisions of the Directive are interpreted differently in the different Member States are also inadmissible.
Workers are not aware of their rights, and Member States do not monitor whether the provisions of the Directive are being correctly applied.
Proper implementation and execution of these provisions is, after all, key to the efficient functioning of the internal market.
This is why all measures, whether in the form of administrative cooperation or of pointers to the proper application of the Directive, are essential actions.
I do hope, however, that the result of such initiatives will be an improvement in the interpretation of the provisions, and not yet more complaints about non-existent social dumping.
<D>
Mr President, overall I welcome this report.
I think it finds the right balance between recognising established cultural habits and the very worrying trend of harmful consumption of alcohol, particularly the growth in the hazardous binge-drinking culture among our young people.
The Commission in its approach identified key targets - protecting our children, combating binge-drinking, reducing injuries and deaths from alcohol rage, road accidents and the whole area of suicide.
My colleagues have pointed out the areas of concern extremely well.
I would now like to emphasise myself the need to add the serious risks of pre-natal alcohol exposure as a key target in the Commission's list to be worked on, and for the health and alcohol forum proposed by the Commission particularly to take up this issue.
This is because the area of the pre-natal damage done by the consumption of alcohol is one very poorly understood by the public at large.
No amount of alcohol is safe during pregnancy, because alcohol is a teratogen.
In fact it is more dangerous during the second and third trimesters, which is what most pregnant women do not understand, because it is usually the first trimester that is the area of concern in terms of taking medication or drugs or any such substances.
Alcohol is particularly dangerous in the second and third trimesters.
Without shaming and blaming, we need to get an educational information campaign out through the Member States, through the GPs, to alert pregnant women immediately to the dangers of alcohol in this area.
Colleagues have mentioned ADHD.
There is also Asperger's Syndrome.
The medical research community has had difficulty in getting published in this area, owing to the politics of alcohol.
Let your forum take over this issue and go further with it.
A final word on alcohol abuse as part of polydrug abuse.
In Ireland a fifth of those treated for problem alcohol use also misuse drugs, and a recent study in France found that driving under the influence of cannabis doubles the risk of being responsible for an accident.
The increasing prevalence of polydrug use needs to be addressed urgently by your forum too, and by each Member State, and the necessary technical supports to detect polydrug use, particularly at roadside police checks, need to be enhanced, with technical support being given to our police authorities.

Mr President, High Representative, Commissioner, this report should provide us with an opportunity to consider how far we have come with the European Union's security and defence policy, where we are now, and what part the European Parliament has to play in this.
In so doing, we must observe that there have so far been 22 deployments within the framework of the European security and defence policy, of which 16 were civilian deployments and 6 military ones.
This means that a very strong emphasis has been placed on the civilian side of things.
This civilian side, of course, comes complete with functional democratic control as the civilian operations under the ESDP are funded from the European budget and are therefore scrutinised by the European Parliament.
There are other things that are funded from the European Union's budget that are directly linked to security policy.
Examples include security research - EUR 1.3 billion over 7 years; Galileo, which we say there are security aspects to - EUR 3.4 billion; and GMES/Kopernikus, a project for which another EUR 1 billion is available.
We also now have, and this is a new development, legislation in the European Parliament in the field of security and defence.
We have adopted a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the intra-Community transfer of defence equipment and on tendering in the field of security and defence.
This is an important first step along the road.
Of particular importance, however, is the information for the European Parliament.
In this regard, our special committee, which also has access to secret information, is of particular importance, as are the regular discussions that we hold in this committee with the Special Representative on these subjects.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the High Representative and his colleagues for the constructive cooperation that has developed.
I shall turn now to the individual points of this report.
This report calls for the European Union to define its own security interests more clearly.
We always speak of the security interests of the individual countries, but we do have common security interests.
The protection of our citizens within and beyond the Union, peace in our neighbourhood, the protection of our external borders, the protection of our critical infrastructures, energy security, the security of our trade routes, the security of our assets at the global level and many other things represent, in reality, individual security interests and common security interests of the European Union.
We also need to consider what the security and defence-related ambitions of the European Union actually are.
The draft report states very clearly that we have no ambition to become a superpower like the United States.
It is also made very clear that we must concentrate on the geographical surroundings of the European Union.
Our priorities are the Balkans - the European Union's main assignments - North Africa, the frozen conflicts in the East and our contribution to resolving the conflict in Palestine.
We must put our focus quite clearly on these areas.
I feel compelled to observe that, at the end of the French Presidency, the Council set very ambitious objectives, namely acquiring the ability to carry out certain operations in parallel.
If that is what we want, we will need the funds to bring it about.
This will involve the establishment of an autonomous and permanent headquarters in Brussels.
This is a first, very clear demand from this Parliament.
There was a very broad majority in favour of this in the committee.
Secondly, we need to bear in mind that the 27 Member States have 2 million soldiers at their disposal.
Three per cent of these soldiers should be made available to the European Union on a permanent basis.
That would be 60 000 soldiers.
This is why the report also calls for the Eurocorps to also be permanently assigned to the European Union.
This call is aimed at the six Member States that make up the Eurocorps.
We then make clear statements about the capabilities that we need to develop.
The 27 Member States of the European Union spend EUR 200 billion per annum on defence, and this EUR 200 billion must be better spent than it has been in the past.
We cannot afford to re-invent the wheel 27 times and we are therefore asking you today to ensure that, in future, where the European Union's and the taxpayers' money is spent on defence, it is better spent than it was in the past.
Thank you very much.
<D>
Madam President, I voted for the report.
I am very concerned about the recent events in Italy.
There is a 'witch hunt' atmosphere developing with regard to Romanian citizens and the Roma, with many punitive expeditions.
The Italian Government is engaged in an obsessive security campaign.
Adopting extreme measures with regard to Roma communities could however exacerbate the already terrible situation for these minorities and undermine opportunities for integration and social inclusion.
We must not forget that, under the rule of law, criminal liability is individual and cannot be attributed to collective groups.
To deviate from this principle would set a dangerous precedent that would lead to the criminalisation of entire ethnic groups or particular nationalities of migrants.
Certainly, immigration is a matter requiring European coordination in order to strengthen the judicial and police tools able to tackle organised crime.
This is not enough, however.
It is important to adopt clear employment policies for disadvantaged groups, including the Roma labour force, establishing support measures aimed at facilitating their progressive integration into the labour market and paying greater attention to education policies for young people.

in writing. - (PT) Orlando Zapata Tamayo died of starvation because he demanded to be treated as what he was: a political prisoner persecuted by a regime that, despite the changes in leadership, continues to rule over its citizens with an iron fist and prohibits them from associating or freely expressing themselves.
The tragic circumstances of this death should put us all to shame.
Especially the political decision makers who, following the lead of Mr Zapatero and Ambassador Moratinos, have changed European policy towards Cuba.
All the European Union has achieved with its tentative attempt at appeasement has been to increase the feeling of impunity, whilst making the democrats - who deserved much more from us - feel more isolated.
I hope for a return to the firm democratic policy that has only recently softened.
I want the European Union to finally acknowledge that this change of policy has been a complete failure.
I also want Oswaldo Payá and the Ladies in White to be able to travel to Europe freely to reveal the circumstances surrounding the events that have been taking place in Cuba.
<D>
on behalf of the ALDE group. - (RO) Honourable President, first of all, I would like to congratulate the Rapporteur for his work.
The cohesion policy is vital for the communities in the underdeveloped regions and sub-regions.
The social-economic aspects, such as poverty, lack of infrastructure, administrative capacities, deindustrialization, low education and training level, high employment rate, poor living conditions, as well as reduced access to services of general interest transforms these communities into vulnerable groups, which represent an ever greater challenge for the cohesion of the European Union territories.
Thus, a relation of interdependence results, between the need to reduce social-economic disparities between regions and the need for social integration of vulnerable groups, a relation that should naturally lead to a constructive process involving a territorial approach both at a national and a European level.
Honourable President, I believe that the absence of statistics regarding the spreading of these groups and their degree of social exclusion, as well as the incapacity of the indicators for measuring inter-regional disparities to supply viable data, prove, one more time, the need for the Member States and the Commission to cooperate more closely in order to obtain a real image of the situation of vulnerable regions and groups, as well as to set up concrete programmes and strategies for territorial development and overcoming social exclusion.
I also believe that Member States should take a first step by identifying these vulnerable groups and setting their priority in the strategic national plans and, afterwards, by developing mechanisms for evaluation and monitoring.
We should not forget that, most of the time, migration is a consequence of poverty and the migration phenomenon itself generates instability and conflicts.
For this reason, honourable President, we believe that vulnerable groups should benefit, from all Member States, from social assistance, equality of opportunities and, more than that, from specific programmes allowing the development of the regions where they come from.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, debates on Russia are never easy.
Russia, on the one hand, is an important global partner, but, on the other hand, it is also a big neighbour, and there I think you have two sides that do not always easily converge.
On the one hand, being a global partner, we see Russia as a real partner, as I said before.
For instance, in the Middle East, in seeking a solution between Israel and Palestine and on many other of these issues.
Or on Afghanistan and Pakistan, yesterday in the conference in The Hague, Russia had an important part to play; or on Iran, or on the non-proliferation issues, or on the big global issues like climate change, which was also mentioned, or now the financial and economic crisis.
Everybody is being affected by that.
This is true for us, but it is also true for Russia and for many other global partners.
Therefore I think we have to see this very clearly, but at the same time we also have to see Russia as a great neighbour, where sometimes we do not see eye to eye in the common neighbourhood.
And we have a common neighbourhood - some of you have mentioned that, be it Moldova or Nagorno-Karabakh or, of course, Georgia.
There we have to make sure we come much closer to each other, but also speak frankly on the difficulties and the differences that exist.
One of these issues is the 'Eastern Partnership', and we discussed the Eastern Partnership only last week in Parliament.
The chief goal of the Eastern Partnership, which is concerned with six of our neighbouring countries, is to help those countries who want to come much more into line with the European Union on certain key issues like standards of governments, freer trade and others.
In these activities, I think it is important that we have these countries as partners.
But at the same time we have also said, on the multilateral platform, that we are, in principle, open to third countries like Russia on an ad hoc basis, as appropriate; certainly Russia is also a full member in the Black Sea Synergy, where regional matters are handled.
So there is also a chance to work together in order to overcome some difficulties that exist.
On the other hand, gas.
With gas, we know - I said it clearly before and I will repeat it - we are interdependent; we know that.
As we also know, the gas crisis has diminished the trust in our partners.
It has underlined the importance of energy provisions in the coming EU-Russia and EU-Ukraine agreements, and they will be there.
We must step up the work to create an internal energy market, but also increase efficiency and diversify supplies.
The new agreement with Russia should therefore lay down, as we always say, legally binding reciprocal commitments.
And, in parallel to the new agreement and for the short term, we are working with Russia to make the early warning mechanism more efficient, as I said before.
We should also foresee monitoring and conflict prevention and resolution, and this should also involve Belarus and Ukraine.
We know that Russia is a very important energy partner for us, contributing 40% of the gas we import and 20% of the gas we consume.
This is, as I said before, a relationship of interdependence.
Since we represent over two thirds of their export revenue - which has made a very significant contribution to Russia's economic development - it is essential that there should be no repeat of the events of last January, and therefore we are working with both the Ukrainians and the Russians to prevent that.
On human rights we do not always see eye to eye.
On the one hand, the EU and Russia share common international commitments, as I said, through the instruments that we have signed together at the UN, at the OECD and at the Council of Europe.
These commitments reflect values and include the obligation to respect the decisions of the bodies they set up.
That is particularly true for the European Court of Human Rights, but it is also evident that the EU and Russia interpret commitments differently.
The European Union and Russia have chosen the path of dialogue on these issues, and this is the right way.
This means that we must also listen to the concerns the Russian side expresses sometimes with regard to some developments inside the European Union including, for instance, the issue of Russian-speaking minorities.
But it is also true, as the President-in-Office of the Council said, that there are clear concerns about the failure to respect human rights in the Russian Federation, and continuing cases of attacks on human rights defenders, journalists and others reflect badly on Russia.
We raise these issues regularly with the high authorities: myself with Sergey Lavrov, and President Barroso with his interlocutors.
We also use our twice-yearly human rights consultations to do so as well.
The discussions in the bilateral meeting between President Barroso and President Medvedev on 6 February also included an exchange on human rights.
President Medvedev himself suggested that these exchanges continue at the 21-22 May summit, and we shall take him up on that.
For instance, the attack on human rights activist Lev Ponomarev last night is the latest reminder of how difficult the situation for human rights defenders is in Russia.
But let me say that the two strands have clearly been reflected in the mandate that the Council has given the Commission to negotiate.
Both are there, and this is the content of our mandate.
Therefore, I think the right way is to follow up on this mandate and, as I said, we are always ready to report on the follow up of our negotiations, as we have just been doing.
<D>
author. - (PL) Mr President, once again we are talking about Iran.
I am the co-author of a resolution prepared by the Union for Europe of the Nations Group.
The situation in Iran is a never-ending story of breaches of human rights.
The European Parliament returns to this issue very regularly, giving the names of more victims and more examples of breaches of human rights.
I have to say with some regret that some of the politicians in the European Union and some governments apply double standards, in that much more is said about human rights in the countries with which there is no trade, where one cannot do business.
In the case of countries with which economic ties are maintained, even unofficially, without saying anything, but making money, people seem to speak about human rights more quietly, in a whisper.
It is very good that the European Parliament is not whispering when it comes to Iran.
In the joint resolution that we are proposing, what I would like to emphasise over and above political divisions, is that we list new, specific and tragic facts that illustrate the drama that is taking place before our eyes in that country.
The attention of the world's public opinion is focused on something else, on certain attempts to create a nuclear power in that country or on the clearly anti-Semitic statements of the President of Iran.
Unfortunately we do not notice the breaches of human rights in that country, so it is good that the European Parliament is considering this issue today.
<D>
in writing. - (FR) It is astounding to see how hemiplegic the European Parliament can be: it can only look right!
The various resolutions proposed by the PSE, Liberals, Verts or even Communists only consider extremism on the part of the 'extreme right'.
What about radical Islamism and all those Trotskyites and communists?
Not once are these types of extremism mentioned.
This is an insult for all the victims of totalitarian communist regimes and for all those who suffer on a daily basis because of the dogma and practices of radical Islamism.
The European Parliament does not believe these types of extremism are objectionable.
They just do not exist, because they do not form part of the current standard vocabulary of political correctness within these walls.
Out of respect for the principles and values of democracy, equality and tolerance, the PSE Group is quick to welcome the dissolution of the extreme right-wing political group Independence, Tradition and Sovereignty (ITS) before calling for the conditions governing the formation of political groups within Parliament to be strengthened.
The leitmotiv of these elected members is to systematically demonise their political opponents in order to impose their conservatism on everyone.
These resolutions are a hypocritical, blind and obscurantist chore.
We will be voting against them.
<D>
(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, I note that the report we are discussing today refers expressly to eradicating rather than merely to combating poverty, as was actually proposed.
I am therefore pleased that my observation has borne fruit, and I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou, for that.
The European Union has become accustomed to reacting very rapidly and with great solidarity to help the victims of natural disasters throughout the world, for example, but it still prevaricates a great deal when it comes to helping the victims of economic and social catastrophes within the EU itself.
I say this because I find it rather difficult to understand why a report that addresses the issue of poverty makes no reference to rising food prices.
This shocks me, because we all know that the poorer a family is, the higher the percentage of its budget that is spent on food.
I therefore think it would be useful to make some reference to the recent Commission communication on the increase in the price of food products, for example.
I also believe, meanwhile, that we should not restrict the eradication of poverty to EU territory alone.
This battle has no boundaries - we are talking of values which are essential to human dignity.
Throughout its history Europe has always been defined more by its expansion throughout the world than by its own identity.
In the 21st century, of all the tasks the EU could perform for the good of humanity, the eradication of poverty will perhaps be the most noble of all.
That is why I hope this issue will be promoted strongly in 2010.
<D>
in writing. - (DE) By adopting the Ehler report the European Parliament has decided on a completely outmoded energy strategy.
CCS (Carbon Capture and Storage) is intended to make production processes that are damaging to the climate seem 'climate friendly'.
However, it does not avoid or reduce CO2 production, as would be the case with renewable energies for example.
In the opinion of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, massive public funding of CCS makes little sense at an economic level.
This money would be put to better, more sustainable use if it were invested in research into the more efficient use of renewable energies.
The Ehler report goes further than the Commission: it seeks to use European structural funds for CCS investment, which will deny these resources to disadvantaged regions and their sustainable development plans.
A CDU member who represents Brandenburg, Mr Ehler is seeking to put money in the pocket of Vattenfall, Europe's fifth-largest power company, enabling it to open more lignite mines in Lusatia (Brandenburg/Saxony), threatening more villages with resettlement.
It is known that Vattenfall intends to generate power from lignite for the next 50 to 60 years, even though this is only possible with an efficiency factor of less than 50%.
Energy-intensive CCS technology will reduce this by a further 10% to 15%.
This is a retrograde step, which is why we do not accept this report, but instead have lodged an alternative proposal.
<D>
The economic crisis has demonstrated the need for public action to support private activities that are in difficulty.
The European Union's cohesion policy plays an essential role in this regard.
By providing financial support for those affected by the economic downturn, the Structural Funds constitute a lever with which to stimulate activity.
Nonetheless, accessing European funding remains difficult for a number of potential beneficiaries.
The procedures are complicated and the delays too long, even though the urgency of the crisis requires simple and rapid measures.
As part of this concern for clarification, I welcome the Commission's initiative aimed at simplifying the financial management of the Structural Funds.
The various proposals are along the lines of a more effective cohesion policy, but one that does not have too pronounced an impact on the Community budget.
I welcome this pragmatic approach.
The Commission must not stop there, however.
This reform, necessitated by the crisis situation, must be the first stage of a radical simplification of the way in which European funds are managed.
Cohesion policy must become an instrument for more effective public intervention with a view to providing real support for economic activity.
<D>
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating my colleague, Mr Lambsdorff, on his excellent report.
I know he dedicated himself to this very important work.
I consider it vital to create a common arms market and to establish a legal framework for this in order to further develop the European security and defence policy (ESDP).
I also welcome the important achievement that the principles of the Treaty, in particular transparency, non-discrimination and openness, will also be implemented in the defence and security market and, as has already been said, this will result in an improvement of the efficiency of defence spending.
The Commission's proposal, as well as Mr Lambsdorff's report, managed to establish a set of rules concerning procurement contracts in the field of security and defence, which allow the proper functioning of the common arms market.
I want to refer to at least two major improvements for both suppliers and the contracting authorities which aim to protect the security of the EU and its Member States.
I would mention here the provisions relating to the security of supply, namely information about tenderers and subcontractors provided to the contracting authorities and the commitments tenderers have to make to ensure security of supply.
On the other hand, tenderers are also protected by the introduction of the review procedure, which guarantees the awarding process is fair and no discrimination occurs.
The proposal increases the transparency in the work procedure, but Member States should not at all be reluctant to it as their security interests are safeguarded, especially by maintaining the derogations from the disclosure of information when security interests are at stake.
In conclusion, I should like to emphasise the fact that it is very important for us to have a common European market for defence.
At the same time, when we are discussing this issue - the common European defence market - or perhaps if we discuss more sensitive issues like offsets in the future, we should seriously take into consideration the strategic interests and the concrete situation of each and every Member State.
<D>
President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you have kindly waited for the Extraordinary European Council to end and so I have rushed here to present its results to you.
We, the French Presidency, wanted you to be immediately informed of the decisions taken, not only because we want to keep you constantly updated on our work, but also because the European Parliament has shown itself to be extremely active in recent months on the issue of Georgia.
Thank you Commissioner.
We want to thank you for this interest and also to inform you of what happened in the Council on 13 August and at the meeting of the Committee on Foreign Affairs on 20 August, on which Jean-Pierre Jouyet is here to present our provisional conclusions.
I would remind you that the conflict began 20 years ago, in 1991/1992.
However, the latest phase of this conflict began during the night of 7 to 8 August.
It would be useful to look at this particular outbreak.
Journalists and historians must study the events and see how they developed in Ossetia and, more particularly, in Tskhinvali, the capital of South Ossetia.
The battle raged during that night and then during 9 and 10 August.
We decided, with my colleague Alexander Stubb, the Finnish Minister for Foreign Affairs who is also President of the OSCE, to go to Tbilisi on Sunday 10 August.
We proposed a ceasefire agreement to President Saakashvili which he accepted.
As it is important, I will quickly go over what we found there, what we saw in Gori and on the roads during this painful episode of the Russian troops' entry and rapid advance.
The first thing to say is that we feared the arrival of Russian troops in Tbilisi.
These troops were in Gori, just 45 or 50 km from Tbilisi.
The road was straight and there were few obstacles.
We therefore thought, with some reason, that the aim of the Russian troops was, as they had said, to respond to the provocation and to liberate South Ossetia, but also to get to Tbilisi and force a change in government.
It was therefore absolutely vital, or at least that is what we thought, for the troops to halt and for the ceasefire to come into force as quickly as possible.
Ceasefire as quickly as possible was our aim.
I met up with President Sarkozy in Moscow the next day but, before that, after having spoken to refugees on the Georgian side and to victims that I met at Gori hospital, I and the French Presidency were keen to go and listen to the stories of refugees on the other side, in North Ossetia, who had arrived from South Ossetia after the bombing of Tskhinvali during the night of 7 to 8 August.
I heard stories that were unfortunately similar in terms of suffering but which clearly revealed very different interpretations.
We met up with President Sarkozy in Moscow where lengthy discussions took place, lasting five hours, between President Medvedev, Prime Minister Putin, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, President Sarkozy and myself.
At the end of these quite tough discussions, there was a press conference during which President Sarkozy and President Medvedev set out the six points of the French agreement which then had to be taken back to Tbilisi for approval, as amendments had been made between our first trip to Tbilisi and what would be our final stay in Tbilisi, the next day.
Two amendments were accepted by President Medvedev, in particular one point on the final status which we understand he did not want in the text.
The ceasefire agreement was accepted by President Saakashvili thanks to this mediation which, while it was not perfect - because nothing is perfect in a situation such as that - you must at least acknowledge that it was quick.
This mediation therefore allowed an effective ceasefire, with a few sad exceptions.
On the ground, the Russian troops began to withdraw on 21 August - this being the second of the six points in the document - although this was nearly eight days later.
However, there were movements that were interpreted differently, as is always the case, because some tanks went in one direction and then also in another.
This withdrawal has still not yet been completed.
Actually, I am not sure whether it has been completed but it has certainly not been fully carried out.
The war ended quite quickly as, on 10 and 11 August, the main war operations were brought to an end, at least according to certain observers, including our French Ambassador, Eric Fournier, who is here.
However, what did not end - and these have wrought havoc - were the actions of the Ossetian and Abkhazian militias which, following behind the Russian troops, were responsible for looting and sometimes even killing.
However, I must say, albeit with the greatest of care, that the damage was not extensive.
I must also say that the damage from the bombing was not extensive.
Of course any damage is always very serious and too much and always leads to too many victims but, compared to what was described to us, the damage has not been as extensive as was feared, which is definitely good.
What we have not seen, and what we should see, given that the accounts have been very biased, is what happened in Ossetia.
While it was possible to see fairly quickly the situation in Georgia, it was not possible to get into Ossetia, at least not easily, and only a few people have managed to get there.
They have all given rather different accounts.
The ceasefire, which was the first of the six points, was therefore immediate and effective.
There was a temporary ceasefire and a permanent ceasefire.
The second point concerned the withdrawal of troops.
It was specified that withdrawal meant, for the Georgian troops, withdrawal to their barracks and, for the Russian troops, withdrawal behind the lines that were held prior to the crisis.
There were also a number of other points, including access to humanitarian aid for all victims.
The specific points which posed a problem were points 5 and 6.
In our negotiations a zone was established along the border between South Ossetia and Georgia where Russian patrols would be temporarily tolerated, while awaiting the arrival of observers from the OSCE or European Union.
A letter of clarification was then needed from President Sarkozy, which was published in agreement with President Saakashvili, to specify that this meant immediately adjacent to the border.
Given that, in places, this border is only two kilometres from the main road crossing through Georgia, this was not straightforward.
There were therefore several points which were agreed pending - and this was clearly specified in the text - the arrival of international observers.
The word 'observers' was used rather than 'peacekeepers'.
All this had to be very precise.
Point 6, which was in a way the most important point, concerned the political settlement and the international discussions or negotiations which had to lead to this political settlement.
This agreement was signed by President Saakashvili with the assistance of Mrs Condoleezza Rice because the first document was signed, but was then amended.
Then there was the document agreed with Mr Medvedev and finally the third and final document agreed with President Saakashvili which we were unable to get him to sign.
It was midnight or one o'clock in the morning when there was a big demonstration.
In the end, we were unable to get him to sign the document, so we then had to get him to sign this, after a few corrections, with the assistance of Mrs Condoleezza Rice who, while passing through Paris, came to see us and who we then entrusted with the document so that this - if I dare say it, the final six-point document - could be signed by President Saakashvili.
The immediate result was the ceasefire!
The less immediate result, although it was very rapid, was the incomplete withdrawal of Russian troops.
The other points will now be closely monitored by us, by the 27 countries making up the European Union and by this Parliament in particular, as the document has just been accepted.
I would remind you that the conclusions of the first Extraordinary Foreign Affairs Council had already been accepted by the 27 Member States and provided for the physical presence of the European Union on the ground.
We have since then entrusted Javier Solana with driving forward this part of the common foreign and security policy.
Two or four French observers have already been sent under the aegis of the OSCE which was already present.
We are hopeful that more observers will be accepted given that yesterday, in a conversation between President Sarkozy and President Medvedev, the latter indicated that he would accept and even wanted there to be observers from the European Union.
We are working to this end.
An extremely rapid result was therefore achieved: in three days, a ceasefire and troops halted who had been threatening Tbilisi; then, after a few days, in fact eight days, with a few movements before the end of these eight days, withdrawal of these Russian troops to Ossetia and Abkhazia.
I am now absolutely ready to answer all your questions of which I am sure there will be many, as is my good fortune, which will keep us here for a very long time.
However, I have forgotten to say a brief word on the document now accepted.
I would remind you that this Extraordinary Council has a clear precedent convened in the month of August 2003 on the situation in Iraq.
During that Extraordinary Council, the unity of the European Union was harmed, which is the very least that one can say.
Now, in 2008, unity has prevailed and it has not been as difficult as we thought to propose a text and get it accepted by those who definitely wanted sanctions - what sanctions? why? - and those who definitely wanted to maintain dialogue with Russia, without sanctions.
You will see that this text is firm in its condemnations but that it leaves the door open as we did not want to engage in a Cold War exercise, as some were proposing.
We wanted to maintain the links so that the political negotiations which are essential in our opinion could be pursued.
We convened this European Council because the President of the French Republic, as the President of the Council of the European Union, considered that the crisis in Georgia was serious and directly affected all Europeans.
Obviously Georgia is not in the European Union, nor is Ukraine.
However, several Member States also wanted this meeting which it was up to us to arrange.
I believe that we were truly inspired because no one else outside the European Union, in our opinion, could have done this.
It was the European Union which had to take charge of this whole issue.
This does not mean that we were on our own - because that was not the case at all - but that it was up to us to take the initiative, it was up to us to show that the European Union is reactive, particularly in a situation where the institutional problems are unresolved.
The European Union has therefore shown, at the highest level, that it enjoys unity and that it wants to fully assume its responsibilities.
I believe that, in comparison to the 2003 precedent, this is real progress.
What were the main results of this Council?
You can clearly see from the text our condemnation of the military actions and the disproportionate reaction of Russia.
Some wanted the series of provocations that probably preceded the bombing of Tskhinvali to be denounced.
It would be very easy to denounce this side and that side but what really counts, when you are trying to carry out a peace mission, is that each side agrees to halt the fighting.
Russia's disproportionate reaction was therefore highlighted.
Once again, we need those on the ground to tell us what actually happened.
It is true that this was not a success on the part of Georgia which had been very widely warned, in particular by the Americans, against provoking this reaction, even if Georgia itself was provoked, as this reaction would be well-prepared, something of which I was completely unaware.
When I went to see the Russian refugees on the other side, in North Ossetia, I saw huge convoys of tanks and military vehicles which were heading for the border.
Were they ready prepared or not?
I leave you to find this out for yourselves, although it does seem that they were not far away.
You can therefore see in the text our condemnation of the military actions and the disproportionate reaction, the unanimous condemnation by the Heads of State or Government of the 27 Member States of the recognition of the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and the reminder of the European Union's attachment to the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia, as recognised by international law and the UN Security Council resolutions.
You can see the confirmation, as the central document given that there is no other, of the six-point agreement reached on 12 August which the European Council has said must be fully implemented.
You can see the firm commitment that we have made to implement this roadmap.
You can see the readiness of the European Union to participate in the international monitoring mechanism provided for by point 5 of this agreement, as I have already mentioned, both through an OSCE mission and through a commitment under the European Security and Defence Policy.
The terms of this participation are yet to be defined but they are on the way to being defined, and not only that, I also believe that things are moving at a very fast pace.
I am not going to explain in detail all the various opinions, but I would reiterate that they were not fundamentally different.
It was all about nuances: does the reminder of international law and the ban on altering the borders of a neighbouring country by force constitute a sanction?
No, this is not a sanction.
It is a basic requirement.
Therefore, there were not many differences of opinion.
There were demands to include this reminder which we accepted in the end and we therefore included this reminder because, as you know, on 9 September there will be a meeting between the European Union and Ukraine.
Also, on 8 September we will return to Moscow with Mr Barroso, Javier Solana and President Sarkozy.
We therefore have a meeting arranged on 8 September in Moscow and on 8 September in Tbilisi - so Moscow and then Tbilisi - in order to record, and we hope that we will be able to record this, that the Russian troops have withdrawn behind the lines indicated to them, in other words behind the border between Ossetia and Georgia.
We will also hope to record that the remaining checkpoints around the Port of Poti and the remaining checkpoints along the border between Ossetia and Georgia but inside Georgian territory have been replaced or will be in a position to be immediately replaced with international observers.
That is what we are expecting.
Everyone has agreed to this meeting which will therefore complete the implementation of the six points of the agreement.
It is on this basis that we will judge the goodwill and political follow-up, depending on which we will then propose a conference.
This will be an international conference involving - and why not, because, for nearly 20 years, the United Nations have been involved in this issue, although more so in Abkhazia than Ossetia - a number of partners so that the political negotiations can begin.
Mr Medvedev has also agreed, which is a very good point, that the refugees may return, and not just the refugees who have left since these recent events, in other words in the last month, but the refugees who have left since the 1990s.
You will say to me that this is actually very debatable because where are they, can they return, do they need to return, do they want to return, and so on.
However, if we are talking about people's right to self-determination, we should note that all these refugees came from either Abkhazia or Ossetia.
This has been accepted and we will wait to see how far this agreement can be implemented.
I will now raise some points which I believe we can then discuss.
I am going to mention the points that were amended or slightly changed because the others you can see for yourself, such as 'gravely concerned by the open conflict ...' and so on.
The text states that the European Council strongly condemns Russia's unilateral decision to recognise the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.
That decision is unacceptable and the European Council calls on other States not to recognise this proclaimed independence and asks the Commission to examine the practical consequences to be drawn.
It recalls that a peaceful and lasting solution to the conflict in Georgia must be based on full respect for the principles of independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity recognised by international law, the Final Act of the Helsinki Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe and the three UN Security Council resolutions.
It emphasises that all European States have the right freely to determine their foreign policy and their alliances, and so on.
The European Council is pleased that the six-point agreement achieved on 12 August on the basis of the European Union's mediation efforts has led to a ceasefire, improved delivery of humanitarian aid to the victims and a substantial withdrawal of Russian military forces.
The implementation of that plan has to be complete, and so on.
This has not been discussed.
Jean-Pierre, you said something to me about the English amendment on Georgia.
I had: the European Union has already supplied emergency aid.
It is prepared to supply aid for reconstruction in Georgia, including the regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.
It is ready to support confidence-building measures and the development of regional cooperation.
It also decides to step up its relations with Georgia, including visa facilitation measures and the possible establishment of a full and comprehensive free trade area as soon as the conditions are met.
It will take the initiative of convening an international conference shortly to assist reconstruction in Georgia and requests the Council and the Commission to start preparations for this conference.
Another point is the impact which the current crisis is having on the whole of the region and regional cooperation.
As regards point 8: the European Council decides to appoint a European Union Special Representative for the crisis in Georgia and asks the Council to make the necessary arrangements.
We will add: recent events illustrate the need for Europe to intensify its efforts with regard to the security of energy supplies.
The European Council invites the Council, in cooperation with the Commission, to examine initiatives to be taken to this end, in particular as regards diversification of energy sources and supply routes.
Finally, at the request of the Germans, Poles and a number of other countries, the end is worded as follows: We call on Russia to join with us in making this fundamental choice in favour of mutual interest, understanding and cooperation.
We are convinced that it is in Russia's own interest not to isolate itself from Europe.
For its part, the European Union has shown itself willing to engage in partnership and cooperation, in keeping with the principles and values on which it is based.
We expect Russia to behave in a responsible manner, honouring all its commitments.
The Union will remain vigilant; the European Council requests the Council, with the Commission, to conduct a careful in-depth examination of the situation and of the various aspects of EU-Russia relations; this evaluation must begin now and continue.
The European Council gives a mandate to its President to continue discussions with a view to the full application of the six-point agreement.
To that end, the President of the European Council will go to Moscow on 8 September, accompanied by the President of the Commission and the High Representative.
Until troops have withdrawn to the positions held prior to 7 August, meetings on the negotiation of the partnership agreement will be postponed.
There is a small addition to point 3: The Council awaits the results of the forthcoming summit between the European Union and Ukraine.
While awaiting the results of this summit, our institutional cooperation with Ukraine will be intensified and stepped up.
(Applause)
<D>
Mr President, I voted in favour of this measure not because it was my considered wish to do so, but because, as a loyal Conservative, I was following the whip.
Left to myself I would probably have abstained or perhaps voted against.
I have to say that issues concerning the Black Sea are not the top priority for my electors in the East Midlands of the United Kingdom, and I suspect not the second or third priority either.
Therefore, you could in a sense say that this was not a matter of the very greatest importance.
However, I do not believe that the European Union should have a common foreign and security policy.
I believe that nation states should have their own foreign policies, and am perfectly happy for them to work together in cooperation when that is in their interests - be this with states in the European Union or with states outside it.
In any case, the common foreign and security policy can have no democratic legitimacy if there is to be no referendum on the Lisbon Treaty.
<D>
I voted for this report because despite improvements made in healthcare, the gap in health outcomes between those at the top and bottom ends of the social scale remains large and, in some areas, continues to widen.
Inequalities experienced in earlier life in access to education, employment and healthcare, as well as those based on gender and cultural background, can have a critical bearing on the health status of people throughout their lives.
The combination of poverty with other vulnerabilities such as childhood, old age or disability further increases health risks and vice-versa, ill health can lead to poverty and/or social exclusion.
Increasingly, the link between social determinants and health inequalities is being recognised.
This means that social problems are becoming widely viewed as being linked to health problems requiring an integrated response.
The social consequences of the current economic and financial crisis have now unfolded.
There are nearly 5 million more unemployed than at the beginning of the crisis.
Many households have seen their income drop, a considerable number is more exposed to poverty and over indebtedness, and some have lost their homes.
Workers on short-term contracts were among the first to be hit by the downturn.
Migrants and young and older workers, who are more likely to be in precarious positions, were especially affected, but categories of workers who were so far relatively well protected also became unemployed.
An innovative view of policy is needed to tackle health inequalities, especially for people in lower socio-economic groups.
<D>
(NL) Mr President, Mr Barroso has just spoken for ten minutes and in those ten minutes he spoke for barely a minute about the Irish referendum and the actual ratification process.
We are certainly used to some arrogance on the part of the Commission, but this beats everything.
Apparently the referendum is not important any longer.
We carry on with the agenda.
Obviously the idea is that Ireland now just has to sort out the problems for itself.
Well, Ireland has said what it thinks and it does not have to do so again.
In fact, Mr Barroso, the Irish referendum carries more weight than the ratification by parliaments in the other Member States.
There is hardly a single Member State in which the ruling party has gone to the electorate with its programme for Europe.
There has not been any public debate of the Treaty.
In Belgium, for instance, the arguments against the Treaty were not even set out by the media at the time of the parliamentary debate.
Nowhere were the voters able to say what they thought about your plans.
Is that the democracy we want?
Europe has to stop being so patronising and arrogant, or it will just become more and more isolated from its citizens.
<D>
President-in-Office. - (SL) I would like to draw Mrs Panayotopoulos' attention to the Council's latest initiative relating to her question.
On 14 February this year, the Council adopted a series of key reports on further implementation of the European Youth Pact and forwarded them to the spring session of the European Council, which will start tomorrow.
The key reports are based on the Commission's latest analysis of the national reform programmes and contain a progress assessment of the implementation of the European Youth Pact for 2007.
On the basis of this analysis, the Council established that, since the adoption of the European Youth Pact in 2005, unemployment has fallen in some Member States.
At European Union level, however, unemployment is still high, at over 17%.
That is why the following recommendations were formulated for further implementation of the pact, and the Council will receive them in the form of key reports this week.
Youth employment, cooperation in education and training and social integration of young people should continue to be the central tasks of economic and social strategies.
Special attention should continue to be paid to young people with fewer opportunities, especially by means of more decisive guidance, multidisciplinary support and adapted measures.
In the future implementation of the Lisbon Strategy we should endeavour to develop the youth dimension.
It is based on an intersectoral approach and a strengthened role for young people.
The first recommendation calls on Member States to focus particularly on youth employment tasks.
In that connection, the Commission is emphasising issues such as: transition from the education system to employment, uncertain labour relations, flexicurity and youth employability.
The Slovenian Presidency has devoted special attention to the problems and challenges of youth employment.
I would like to mention the international conference entitled 'Jobs for Youth - Prosperity for All', which will take place next month in Slovenia during this Presidency.
<D>
President-in-Office of the Council. - I should like to thank Brian Crowley for raising the question.
I think you are certainly aware that the Member States are, in the first instance, responsible for designing and implementing their employment policies.
However, the Council has a number of responsibilities in the field of employment, including the annual adoption of the employment guidelines in accordance with Article 128 of the Treaty.
Especially now that Europe is facing a financial and economic crisis, the Council is paying special attention to the employment policies of the Member States.
You specifically asked in your question about the current initiatives by the European Council to help combat youth and long-term unemployment in Europe.
In December 2008, the European Council agreed on a European Economic Recovery Plan to provide a coherent framework for action to be taken at the level of the Union, as well as for measures adopted by each Member State, taking account of their individual circumstances.
The European Council's conclusion stressed, in particular, rapid additional action by the European Social Fund to support employment, especially for the benefit of the most vulnerable groups in the population.
The European Council undertook to evaluate the implementation of the plan at its upcoming March spring Council, indicating that additions or amendments to it could be made if necessary.
During the first half of 2009, the Czech Presidency is paying particular attention to employment measures also, within the context of the spring European Council.
The spring European Council will consider the employment situation in the Community and adopt conclusions thereon on the basis of the Joint Employment Report adopted by the Council and the Commission.
The opinion of the European Parliament on the matter will be welcomed in view of the European Council in March.
Based on the assessment of the European Council, the Council will adopt the guidelines on the Member States' employment policies.
The present employment guidelines adopted last year, as well as previous versions, have consistently stressed the importance of tackling youth and long-term unemployment in the Member States.
Since the autumn of 2008, when the effects of the present crisis on employment started to be evident, the Employment Committee, which was established by the Council in accordance with Article 130 of the Treaty, has undertaken the new task of continuous monitoring of the Member States' employment situation.
The committee's findings are being passed on to the Council.
Moreover, the Presidency has decided to organise the Employment Summit so as to maintain a platform for the debate and eventual decisions, and that will be held on 7 May.
Topics for discussion will be confirmed after the spring European Council - so we are planning to have the orientation debate on this next week.
It should also be mentioned in this context that during this year, the European Parliament and the Council, as the co-legislators, are evaluating and considering amendments to the European Globalisation Fund, an instrument aimed at the elimination of negative globalisation impacts, where job losses certainly belong, as well as decreasing the risk that redundant employees will become long-term unemployed.
The aim is to avoid long-term unemployment by timely assistance to the employees affected through activation programmes, such as training, which would enable improved qualifications.
On the whole, promoting employment, including fighting long-term unemployment and youth unemployment, has always featured high on the agendas of the Council and of the European Council.
The Presidency supports the implementation of the flexicurity principles.
Their implementation to national policies, together with continuing structural reform, will help improve the situation of vulnerable groups in the labour market, which include the young, the elderly, the long-term unemployed and people with low qualifications.
The honourable Member can be assured here that during spring 2009, amidst the global financial and economic crisis and rising unemployment, this continues to be the case.
<D>
(SL) Freedom of movement and the abolition of internal borders are two of the most important factors of European integration.
We have to facilitate movement in the Schengen area for citizens of third countries who are legally resident in a Member State.
It is unacceptable that, because of red tape, we should restrict the movement in Europe of students, researchers and companies.
Similarly, we have to enable freedom of movement as soon as possible for the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania, and the people of Kosovo, who paradoxically have fewer rights to free travel today than they did years ago.
Obviously, conditions have to be right for that to happen and we should not allow ourselves to be misled by data on mass illegal immigration.
The people of the Western Balkans have been isolated by the visa regime for far too long.
They need to strengthen contacts with the citizens of the Union but, more often than not, rejection of their visa applications prevents them from doing this.
Let us not risk engendering an even stronger sense of isolation and discrimination, particularly amongst young people, who may never have had a chance to discover the Union.
Let us therefore waste no time once either Bosnia and Herzegovina or Albania comply with the visa liberalisation criteria.
Any action we take to facilitate travel in the Schengen area will be a step forward and will be in the interests of the European Union.
<D>
Vice-President of the Commission. - (DE) Mr Burke, I share your concern about rising fertiliser prices.
They have indeed risen disproportionately.
Understandably, that creates major problems and great concern in European farming.
Fertiliser prices have risen because of the sharp rise in demand, which comes on top of higher transport and energy costs.
There are, therefore, three factors: higher demand because of the rapid growth in other parts of the world, higher energy prices and higher transport prices.
Demand has risen across the world, as you know, and this affects not just fertiliser but a whole range of other goods too, including cash crops and food.
It is important to remember that, for the fact is that although European farmers have to spend more money on fertiliser, as they are indeed doing, at the same time they are getting better prices for their harvests.
FAO statistics over a comparable period show that food prices have risen by 37% over a 12-month period.
We saw the sharpest rise with milk products, at 80-200%, and cereals, at 50-80%.
The Commission believes it is vital to observe the rules of competition.
As long as that is the case, the Commission does not consider it appropriate to intervene in a market where the latest developments can be traced largely to factors over which the Commission has no influence whatsoever.
Let me repeat: we have no influence over the three deciding factors that led to the price rises.
As regards longer-term developments, the Commission would also draw your attention to the importance of promoting competition on the natural gas market.
I think there is a real chance here of easing the situation somewhat.
If the measures the Commission proposed under the third energy package are accepted, we should see an improvement in gas market prices.
That could also lead to lower prices for nitrogen fertiliser produced in the European Union.
As you know, however, it all depends on whether the energy package proposed by the Commission is accepted.
<D>
Mr President, first of all, it was entirely natural for Mr Schulz to respond.
As I understand it, he was doing so in a personal capacity.
My dear Martin, if I hurt you by comparing you to a French Socialist, I regret it.
(Applause)
In my mind, it was not an insult, but I freely admit that the important thing is what the addressee thinks.
Therefore, Mr Pöttering, I withdraw my remark.
Mr Schulz is also able to speak like a French Socialist.
Mr Nassauer, thank you for your support.
Yes, we need the Treaty of Lisbon and, to speak my mind, I will fight to the very last minute of the French Presidency to convince people of the need for Europe to develop institutions for the 21st century.
A politician is somebody who shoulders his responsibilities.
I supported the Lisbon process and I will fight to ensure that the Lisbon process reaches its conclusion; and I would reiterate one thing: if we do not have Lisbon, we will have Nice, and if we have Nice, that is an end to new enlargements, which would be deeply regrettable.
Let us hope, then, that everybody will shoulder their responsibilities.
Mr Nassauer, I take your point that much work is needed on the climate change package.
I am well aware of that, but we must not give up on our ambitions, for I am convinced that it is easier to reach a compromise on a big ambition than on a small one.
A really ambitious proposal will be easier to reach a compromise on than a more limited proposal, and it would a mistake if, in trying to please everybody, we ended up with a completely incomprehensible European policy.
We must be aware of this risk.
Mr Goebbels, you talked about plumbing and architecture, and, indeed, I am counting on Luxembourg's support so that the financial architecture can be fundamentally redesigned both within and outside our continent.
However, Mr Goebbels, this is not a criticism, far less an attack: it is simply a comment.
Mrs De Sarnez put it very well: we cannot fight against certain practices outside our continent, and yet tolerate them within it.
That is all.
Those who think they are being targeted are really assuming a lot; I myself am not targeting anyone in particular, and I would not dream of doing so.
Mrs De Sarnez, thank you for saying that we have taken the right decisions.
May I say, personally, that I support your proposal for a European regulator: it makes sense.
Why can we not manage it straight away?
It is because certain smaller countries think that, by defending their own system of regulation, they are defending their national identity.
I am not blaming anybody.
Therefore, Mrs De Sarnez, my view is that, at the end of the day, we will need a European regulator and that, in the meantime, we at least need to establish coordination between European regulators.
That is the route that we are proposing, with the Commission, and I think that it is the only realistic one, because otherwise we will reach an impasse.
You also mentioned the need for European economic governance and a European economic plan.
You are right to do so, but I should like, in connection with your speech, to challenge the claim, not made by you, equating any European economic initiative with an increase in the deficit.
Emphatically, enough is enough.
We have the right to speak freely.
It is possible to be in favour of a European economic policy without favouring an increase in the deficit, and we will not be able to coordinate European policies simply by means of a revival on request.
We - I am not saying 'you' - must not put words in each other's mouths like we did, back in the day, with those who dared to have an opinion on monetary policy: it is possible to advocate a different monetary policy without bringing into question the independence of the ECB.
I will say it: it is possible to be in favour of a European structural economic policy without favouring an increase in the deficit.
Let us stop saying that some are right and some are wrong.
Far from it, the European debate must be a real debate, and nobody has a monopoly on the truth.
From time to time, we need to step away - and this may be the only point on which I agree with Mr de Villiers - we sometimes need to step away from the dogmas that have so damaged the idea of Europe, dogmas that have even less legitimacy given that they often do not result from decisions made by democratic, and thus legitimate, bodies.
My own European ideal is strong enough for European democracy to be a true democracy.
Groupthink, dogmas, habits and conservatism have done a great deal of damage, and I will take the opportunity to say more on that in relation to another subject.
Mr Szymański, I should like to say that I understand full well Poland's problems, particularly the dependence, up to 95%, of its economy on coal, but I think that Poland needs Europe in order to modernise its mining industry and that we can perfectly well reach agreements with Poland on clean coal.
What is more, in order to modernise its mining industry, Poland needs the whole of Europe.
We need Poland, and Poland needs Europe.
It is on this basis that we, along with Mr Barroso, are going to seek a compromise with our Polish and Hungarian friends and some of those who have concerns about their growth.
Mr de Villiers, I have, as you say, overturned dogmas, because I believe in being pragmatic, but, honestly, do not ascribe to Lisbon, to the treaty, shortcomings that it does not have.
I am in a position to know that the Treaty of Lisbon is not a miracle.
It is not perfect, but, apart from in the Vendée, Mr de Villiers, there is no such thing as perfection, particularly when we are bringing together 27 countries with different governments and different histories.
You need to give up on the ideal treaty - you know full well that it will never exist.
Europeans are pragmatists, sensible people who would prefer an imperfect treaty that makes things better to a perfect treaty that will never exist, because there will never be an agreement on this intangible idea.
That is what Europe is all about: making progress every day, because we wanted to bring an end to war and because we want to create an area of democracy.
I think, Mr de Villiers, that you should turn your mind to a different fight, because this one appears to consist in your creating an imaginary enemy when it is quite clear, in the current crisis, that the people of Europe understand that working together is a strength, not a weakness.
Even somebody as strong and as talented as you will be powerless to face this financial crisis alone.
It would be better to achieve a proper compromise with the whole of Europe than to sit on your own in a corner, knowing that you are right.
On the subject of having a 'free hand', Mr de Villiers, my response applies to you, it is the response of a free man, including in French political debate.
And I think that the most important thing for us is to stop waffling, and I think that good compromises can be reached by sincere people who follow through on their ideas and that the problem with European political debate is a lack of ideas, which has affected all of us, all the political groups, as if we were paralysed at the idea of coming up with something new.
When Europe has moved forward, it has been because, at a given point, men and women have cleared new ground; and the self-criticism for which you were calling is something that we should all undertake.
For a long time, we in Europe have acted as if we were immovable objects.
We followed the founding fathers, but we did not follow their example: we did not clear new paths, or come up with new ideas.
I firmly believe that, at this point, we need to show some imagination, because, in the end, the greatest risk comes from not doing anything, today, and from not being bold when faced with a completely new situation.
Mr Kozlík, transparency is absolutely vital.
On the issue of rating agencies, I think that it is the attitude of the rating agencies that has been the most scandalous part of the crisis.
These agencies rated products 'triple A' on Friday, and then downgraded them to 'triple B' on Monday.
We cannot carry on with this monopoly of three rating agencies, most of which are American.
The issue of the rating agencies, of their independence in relation to certain groups, and of the existence of a European rating agency will certainly be one of the crucial issues at the first summit on future regulation.
On the subject of competition, I should like to say to you - to all of you who spoke about competition - that I believe in competition, but I have had enough of people who want to make it an end in itself, when in truth it is simply a means to an end.
Competition is a means to growth; it is not an end in itself, and I will make every effort to bring this concept back into the new European policy.
I believe in freedom, I believe in free trade, and I believe that we should reject protectionism, but competition must be a means for growth.
Competition as an objective, as an end in itself, is a mistake: I thought so before the crisis, and I still think so after the crisis.
Mr García-Margallo, you are right that we need a new Bretton Woods, because, as Mr Daul and Mr Schulz said just now, there is no point holding an international summit if all we are going to do is apply sticking plasters.
If we are going to change half the system, it is not worth it.
You mentioned accounting standards, but take a look at our banks.
To start with, the dictatorship of the US accounting standards has become intolerable.
Secondly, the amount that the banks can lend depends on their own funds and assets.
If we look at assets using mark-to-market, on the basis of a market that no longer exists, having been completely destabilised, we will impoverish the banks, which will consequently be even less able to do their job.
The question of changing accounting standards, as raised by the President of the Commission, had our full support - it was a matter of urgency.
I should also like, Mr President, to pay tribute to the European Parliament's responsiveness in being able to vote for this change, because we reached unanimity in the codecision procedure with startling speed, which the European Council welcomed.
Mr Rasmussen, could we have avoided the crisis?
Before we can decide that, we need to agree on what caused it.
What happened?
The United States of America, our allies and our friends, have been living beyond their means for the past three decades.
The Federal Reserve Bank pursued a monetary policy that involved keeping interest rates extraordinarily low, which made funds available to anyone who wanted to borrow.
For the last 20 or 30 years, we have been carrying with us the astonishing debts of the world's greatest power, and it is now up to the whole world to settle those debts.
Under those circumstances, the Americans need to shoulder their responsibilities and accept the consequences with us, but I do not see how we, on our own, could have told them to put a stop to this strategy.
I would add that some of our banks are no longer doing their job: a bank's job is to lend to individuals and to businesses, to support individuals with the growth of their families and to support businesses with the growth of their projects, and to earn money after a given period.
Our banks have developed in what they call the trading rooms, which are places of speculation, and they considered for years that it was easier to earn money by speculating than by investing.
I would add that the mutualisation of risks has meant that all our banks behave themselves.
There are 8 000 banks in Europe, 44 of which operate internationally.
If we had taken the responsibility of allowing a bank to fail, as occurred in the US with Lehman Brothers, the whole of the system would have collapsed.
I do not know how we could have avoided the crisis, Mr Rasmussen, but I think that, if we had not responded as we did, the crisis would have buried us: that is something I believe quite strongly.
You say that we need proposals before Christmas, but actually we need them before mid-November.
I do indeed intend, with President Barroso, to take initiatives to ensure that we, as Europeans, go to the summit with one voice, attempting one more thing, Mr Rasmussen: we need to agree not on the lowest common denominator, but on the highest, because any consensus entails the risk that, in trying to force an artificial agreement, we may scale back our ambitions.
It is a risk.
I hope that we will remain ambitious, and not scale back our ambitions too much, but still speak with one voice.
I will not go back over hedge funds; I have already said that they need to be regulated.
No financial institution, be it public or private, should escape regulation.
Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, you asked whether discussions with Russia will continue regardless of events.
Of course not, but put yourself in our place.
Russia stopped its tanks 40 km outside Tbilisi, as we in Europe had asked it to.
Russia withdrew its troops back over the borders from before the crisis of 8 August.
Russia allowed observers to be deployed, most notably European observers, and Russia, albeit with rather bad grace, is going to the Geneva discussions.
If, given all that, we suspend the EU-Russia summit, who will be able to understand Europe's policy?
No one.
I would add that, along with President Barroso, we have taken the precaution of not suspending, but postponing the summit.
What is the difference?
If we had decided to suspend the summit, we would have needed a unanimous decision from the European Council to resume, and in my opinion that would have been politically embarrassing.
The decision to postpone it allows us to resume without giving out gold stars that are not deserved.
I therefore believe that this strategy shows composure, and is calm and lucid.
I do not think we could have done anything else, and I remain convinced that Russia will be a partner with which we can have dialogue, with which we can be frank, but we can only encourage them to develop if we talk to them.
If, on the other hand, we do not talk, Russia will feel that it is surrounded, and our ideas will be less influential.
I am convinced of this but, of course, I may be proven wrong by future events.
It is therefore a question of accepting our responsibilities.
Mr Wojciechowski, it is not up to the President-in-Office of the Council to decide who should represent Poland.
Poland had two seats at the European Council, and it was up to Poland to decide who should be in them.
Imagine a Europe in which the President of the European Council said, 'no, you cannot come in, and you can'.
What sort of Europe would that be?
Poland has a president - whom you clearly do not support - and it has a prime minister; it is up to them to act as statesmen and as Europeans to decide who should represent Poland.
In the end, we managed to get through it, and at the beginning of December I will have the opportunity to go to Poland, where I will tell the Polish President: 'You must keep your promise.
You promised to sign the Treaty of Lisbon, which your parliament ratified, and you must keep this promise.'
That is the credibility of a statesman and a politician.
(Applause)
I believe strongly enough in Poland's importance in Europe to say so without anyone taking offence.
Mr Martin, we need a bold European democracy.
I am aware of your campaign, your campaign against corruption and for a fully-functioning democracy.
You are absolutely right, but I can tell you that, with President Barroso, we have shown that we can be bold.
Moreover, there are even people in this Chamber who felt that I was moving without a mandate.
If I had to wait until I had a mandate to move, I would certainly move less often.
Mrs Sudre, thank you, too, for your support.
Europe does exist now, and you are quite right that the status quo is not an option.
I think that is something on which we can all agree.
The worst possible outcome would be if, once the storm had passed, we carried on as if nothing had happened.
That would mean the end of the European ideal, and we do not have the right to let this opportunity pass us by.
So, then, some people are surprised: why are we holding a summit so quickly?
This is why.
It is because we said to ourselves that, if we waited too long, particularly if we waited until the new US President were elected, the situation could continue to worsen and we would have no answer.
Or else the situation would improve, and then, by next spring, everybody would have forgotten about it and nothing would change.
We therefore needed to hold the summit, or at any rate the first one, in November, regardless of the timetable in the US.
Ladies and gentlemen, I think I have responded to everyone who spoke.
I am also bound by the Presidency's timetable and the press conference that I have to give with the President of the Commission and the President of the European Parliament.
I should like to apologise to the other speakers if I have not responded to everybody.
It is not, of course, because I do not want to, but because I have been asked to stick to the arrangements for the day.
I have tried my best, and I will, of course, have the opportunity to return to your Parliament in December, if you wish, to respond at greater length to the questions of everyone who takes the floor.
<D>
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the President of the Commission rightly referred to one of the core challenges of the present time, namely the question of how we should organise home-affairs policy in Europe on the basis of the Treaty that is to be signed tomorrow, on the basis of the new legal structures of the European Union.
He cited the problem of mass immigration into Europe as an example of the way in which an internal European area, by which I mean a legal area that has external borders but no longer has internal borders, can be organised.
We do that on an intergovernmental level.
No one should be under any illusions - the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement is not the law of the European Union; it is not Community law, but an intergovernmental instrument.
That in itself shows that we still have a structural defect, for intergovernmental instruments are primarily a form of law that focuses on national sovereignty rather than on the creation of an effective European framework.
This is a fundamental distinction.
The fact is that law based on national sovereignty enables every manifestation of national particularism and every individual reservation to block the progress of the Union.
In view of the challenges facing us in the field of migration policy, that is something we cannot afford.
To that extent, President Barroso is perfectly correct, for it is wrong that some - in southern Europe, for example - should be under intense migratory pressure, while those at the other geographical ends of Europe wash their hands of the problem.
That cannot go on indefinitely.
The step we are now taking in relaunching the integration process on the basis of a new Treaty is therefore a first step that must be followed by more, by which I mean closer integration in other areas, including those of the common home-affairs policy, the common security policy and the common justice policy.
This brings me to my second point, which is of particular importance to us at the present moment.
We shall be formally signing the Charter of Fundamental Rights today.
Splendid!
An exquisite table, magnificent chairs, a congenial atmosphere, as always.
(Interjection by Daniel Cohn-Bendit: And magnificent Members of Parliament!)
Yes, wonderful Members of Parliament too.
Some Members, however, are nicer than others, Mr Cohn-Bendit.
(Laughter)
The setting will be marvellous, as always.
Yet it all reminds me of a close friend of mine who has been married several times in his life and has also filed for divorce several times.
And every time I attended his wedding and was about to go home after the solemn celebration and the magnificent function that had been laid on, I would say to him, 'You gave us a great day, as always'.
I feel a bit like that today.
I was in Rome - along with you, Mr Pöttering, and a number of other Members who are here today.
We experienced that in Rome.
It was like a wedding - celebratory, fine food, a wonderful ceremony, great music,
(Interjection by Daniel Cohn-Bendit: Beautiful city!)
a beautiful city, a splendid atmosphere, no Cohn-Bendit there, so just magnificent!
(Laughter)
We went home afterwards and experienced the divorce.
And today we are off to the next wedding, this time in Lisbon: splendid atmosphere, wonderful city, no Cohn-Bendit - everything just as it should be.
I only hope that another petition for divorce will not follow in Ireland.
In short, ladies and gentlemen, we have no reason to celebrate until the Treaty has actually been ratified in all 27 countries.
It makes sense to ratify the Treaty.
Those anti-Europeans who wanted to scupper the constitution because they believed they could halt the integration process that way have certainly been taught a lesson by this Treaty.
It is true that the Lisbon Treaty does not satisfy all our wishes, but it is better than destroying Europe by constantly opposing integration.
(Applause)
And those who rejected the draft Constitutional Treaty because they believed it was short on social policy and needed a stronger social element will not find that extra element in this new Treaty, but the proclamation of the Charter of Human Rights and its integration into the Treaty have made it possible to realise a number of fundamental social rights.
There were no doubt reasons for the rejection of the draft constitution by extremists on both sides.
I can sympathise more with those who rejected it on social grounds than with the anti-Europeans, who reject the Treaty on principle because they do not want this Union.
One thing, however, is quite clear: this Treaty can only be a stepping stone.
It is a step forward, but it does not take us far enough.
Nevertheless, it is a step that must be taken now in any event.
I hope that this marriage is for life and that the divorce lawyers will stay at home, for none of the challenges of the coming years - and my honourable colleague Mr Swoboda will shortly be speaking about Kosovo - will be surmountable unless we set Europe on firm institutional foundations.
(Applause)
<D>
Mr President, Latin America is a continent with more than 600 million inhabitants, contributes more than 10% of the world's gross domestic product, has 40% of the earth's plant species and at the same time has a dynamic and extraordinarily active young population.
Despite the economic boom of recent years, however, this is not the best time for Latin America in terms of its integration.
This is what President Óscar Arias said at his inauguration and I was reminded of it last weekend at a seminar organised in São Paulo with Alejandro Toledo, the former President of Peru, and Fernando Enrique Cardoso, the former President of Brazil.
There have been tensions between Argentina and Uruguay; the ALCA project has failed; Venezuela has left the Andean Community; there have been problems between Brazil and Bolivia over the nationalisation of energy resources, and between Argentina and Bolivia for the same reason; there have been disputes between Ecuador and Colombia, between Colombia and Venezuela, between Mexico and Venezuela, and so on.
This initiative by the European Commission, supported by Parliament and the Council, to establish this strategic partnership therefore sends out a clear, well-defined message that Latin America remains on the list of action priorities for the European Union, due not least to Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner's personal commitment.
In the case of Mexico, this strategic partnership aims specifically to underline that country's importance on the Latin American and world stages and, in addition, it is an essential, key step in consolidating our existing relations with Mexico and expanding coordination on topics of world importance.
This new step is an opportunity to boost political dialogue even further and to coordinate the positions of both parties at world level and also in the various multilateral forums and international bodies.
Consultation mechanisms will enable joint positions to be adopted on concrete issues of global reach such as security, the environment or socioeconomic questions.
For the European Union it is also an excellent opportunity to develop privileged relations with a country that plays a leading role in Latin American forums such as the Rio Group, in which it holds the presidency until 2010.
Mexico takes part in the G20, the G8+5, the World Trade Organization, the International Monetary Fund and also the OECD, in which it is the only Latin American member.
Therefore, seeking joint solutions to the world economic and financial crisis, drawing up ambitious strategies for the success of the United Nations Conference on Climate Change to be held in Copenhagen, developing a structured dialogue on immigration, or collaborating to achieve the Millennium Development Goals are some of the things that can be achieved at the annual summits between the European Union and Mexico if the strategic partnership that we are proposing is set up.
In the resolution that it will adopt this morning, Parliament will also reiterate its support for President Calderón in the fight against drug trafficking and organised crime.
In addition, and in a spirit of mutual respect, dialogue and shared responsibility, I believe we should take on joint challenges, such as seeking to protect vulnerable groups in society like women or representatives of the media.
Commissioner, this year we are celebrating the 25th anniversary of the political talks held in San José, at which, thanks to the major mobilisation of political talent in Central America and the monitoring by the European Union, peace was finally brought to the conflict-torn Central American isthmus.
In its support for peace, understanding, concord and reconciliation, the European Union has, in my view, been doing an honourable job in Central America and also in other parts of the world.
Now that these values are being consolidated, albeit not without difficulty and not everywhere to the same extent, it is clearly time for development.
Based on our European experience, however, that will be more difficult if there is no integration.
I believe that we are providing a substantial impetus through this strategic partnership with Mexico and, above all, we are sending out a clear, well-defined message about Europe's commitment to Latin America.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, first of all, I would like to offer my sincere thanks to Minister Borloo for his commitment in relation to the climate change package because it really is a very good solution and one that we can defend to the hilt.
I would like, however, to talk about external relations, and in doing so I am also addressing the new Minister for European Affairs.
The Council has adopted the fundamentals of the Eastern Partnership.
President Sarkozy has already said that, if we want to succeed in the Black Sea region, it is obvious that we have to include Russia.
Of course this must be a Russia that also respects the territorial integrity and independence of the countries there and that is prepared to help solve the problems in the Black Sea region.
We certainly also need Turkey.
I am really amazed that Turkey has not been mentioned at all!
How, in this situation and in this region, can we hope to solve anything without Turkey?
Recently, I led a delegation from this Parliament to Turkey.
Mr Rocard, who was a member of the delegation, repeatedly asked: 'And how are you finding the French Presidency?
Is it behaving objectively?'
This question was always answered in the affirmative, in other words with the answer that the French Presidency had indeed been behaving objectively.
If France's behaviour were just to continue in this vein - and I am talking now about France as a Member State - the negotiations with Turkey would be concluded very quickly, with the chapters all completed.
Consequently, what are we doing with a Turkey that we need as a partner in this region?
I do not want to decide your answer for you, Minister, but you need to consider how we go on from here, because, if we hope to achieve something in this region in terms of stability and solving its crises, we need cooperation with Turkey and we have to recognise that Turkey is an important partner for Europe.
For this it is not just the French Presidency we need, but France the country.
<D>
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Thank you Mr President.
Let me first thank the rapporteur for the great work accomplished and all my colleagues for their determination not to give up fighting gender-based violence.
This report shows that the European Parliament considers that immediate action to combat violence against women is not only necessary but urgently needed.
The Commission must acknowledge that all arguments point to the fact that EU-wide measures and instruments have to be introduced.
We know that, throughout the Union, huge discrepancies exist in Member States' legislation to combat violence against women.
Last year, a feasibility study by the Directorate-General for Justice found differences in access to protection orders, the availability of support services and the expertise and capacity of the responsible public servants.
We have seen signs of commitment towards the eradication of all forms of violence and an efficient policy framework at EU level, notably within the Women's Charter which you presented last year, and the communication on the implementation of the Stockholm Programme.
Nevertheless, many Member States have failed in implementing efficient legislation to protect women from all forms of violence and discrimination, and we are now seeing that the core values of our Union do not apply to half its citizens.
Therefore, we now call on the Commission to come up with a dedicated legislative proposal.
A set of minimum requirements must be drawn up and incorporated into a legislative act which should be part of a comprehensive strategy addressing all forms of gender-based violence.
This strategy and policy initiative should also be complemented by broad awareness-raising activities.
I am thinking, in particular, about a European year on combating all forms of violence against women, for which we are currently collecting citizens' signatures.
Finally, having regained our founding principles laid down in the Treaty, and the commitment from your side which has already been stated, we expect today a clear answer on how and when the Commission intends to propose effective measures at EU level.
<D>
(SV) Mr President, the conflict in Chad cannot be seen in isolation from that in Darfur, in Sudan.
It is fairly clear that the Government of Chad is supporting rebels in Darfur.
The Chadian opposition reports that Darfur rebels are fighting side by side with the Chadian Government army against Chadian rebels.
My country, Sweden, is contributing a few hundred soldiers to the EUFOR mission.
The purpose of the mission is to guarantee the security of the civilian population, but unfortunately there is evidence that the force is being used as a pawn in the internal game in Chad.
The President of Chad, Idriss Déby, has made a statement calling on EUFOR to take eastern Chad as soon as possible.
Déby clearly wants to use EUFOR to secure the survival of his own regime.
Let me put a question to the Commission and the Council: how can you guarantee that EUFOR will act entirely independently of such pressures?
What do you think about the cooperation of the Déby Government with the rebels in Darfur?
Am I wrong?
In that case, convince me!
As regards the prisoners from the civilian opposition in Chad, it is good that there have been some releases, but much more needs to be done.
What is the EU doing to ensure that all political prisoners are released immediately?
<D>
(EL) Madam President, the serious maritime accidents we have witnessed on European seas must certainly not be repeated.
In my country, Greece, we had last year's shipwreck on Santorini, the causes of which have not yet been investigated.
The loss of human life, the considerable damage done to tourism and the environmental time-bomb of the oil trapped in the tanks, are proof enough that we cannot afford to be careless.
The issue of safety at sea is of vital importance.
The Union must not only ensure the sustainability of European shipping, but constantly upgrade it so that it can compete internationally.
Meanwhile, we should not neglect the need to protect natural resources.
If we do not act immediately, we shall undoubtedly have lost valuable time in responding effectively to the consequences of maritime accidents.
In the wake of a maritime accident, systematic technical research carried out on the basis of international rules is an effective way of gaining a better picture of the causes.
The independence of investigating bodies is therefore of key importance and I regret that the Council fails to grasp this.
Another important issue is that of cooperation between authorities, especially when an accident affects a number of Member States.
The question of ports of refuge and of the vessel inspection system is crucial in maritime safety.
It must be extended to ships in transit, which should provide guarantees that they are able to respond in the event of an accident or another such disaster.
I would like to end by congratulating the rapporteurs on their strong position with regard to the Council, and I hope that after the vote the Council, understanding our position, will contribute positively towards completing the legislative procedure.
<D>
- (SK) The own-initiative report from Mr Catania has prompted a significant exchange of views between political groups and members of Parliament.
The European Union is now facing very serious problems, such as the financial crisis and the energy crisis caused by the Ukrainian-Russian conflict.
This is a period when we should act together and avoid any moves that might undermine our unity.
The consequences of the crises will undoubtedly affect every citizen of the European Union, whether Slovak, Pole, Hungarian or German.
I consider the attempts to provoke quarrels between Member States, which periodically crop up in our sessions, to be a sign of ignorance of the current serious situation where EU unity is under threat.
We should concentrate more on finding solutions and on ratifying the Treaty of Lisbon in order to boost the competitiveness of the European Union.
I have repeatedly expressed the view here in the European Parliament that autonomy has no place within our common space.
The key idea of integrating EU countries must not be forgotten, not to mention ignored or rejected.
We must keep in mind Schuman's statement that an intelligent European cannot rejoice in his neighbour's misfortune since we are all bound by a common fate, both in good times and in bad times.
<D>
Mr President, on a point of order, I rise under Rule 166, which says that the Member shall first specify to which rule he is referring.
I am referring to that one.
I understand that you cut off Mr Martin before he had a chance to finish what he wanted to say.
He was making a point about yesterday.
Yesterday, Mr Schulz made a lengthy political statement without referring to the rule under which he was speaking.
It was allowed by the President, whereas Mr Martin was cut off.
I think there is a bias at work here and a double standard, where those in favour of the EU are allowed to say what they want and those who are not in favour of it are cut off.
Could we have an even application of the Rules please?
(Applause from the right)
<D>
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, the decision to lift the veto towards almost everyone on the import into the European Union of chlorinated chicken is a real textbook case of what the Commission, which is supposed to protect the higher public interest of Europe's citizens, can no longer and should no longer do.
As with all food sectors, poultry farmers, and particularly chicken farmers, have made enormous efforts in recent decades.
They have invested heavily in order to comply with standards and are subject to no fewer than 70 regulations, directives and other European decisions.
The sector is also subject, as we know, to fierce competition in Europe but also from Brazil and the US.
Need we remind you, since no one has mentioned it yet, of the bird flu outbreak in Europe - this was only three years ago - when poultry meat consumption fell by more than 20%?
Why should we now subject this sector to such a distortion of competition in relation to US farmers, who are not in any way subject to the same health and safety constraints?
The purpose of this brief review is to underline the essence of this matter.
Perhaps this is not an environmental and health issue, or at least so I have heard people say.
However, I would like more clarification and research on the subject.
Our refusal, Commissioner, is essentially an industrial and cultural decision, and ultimately a political one.
It is a cultural decision because Europeans have the right to choose their food model; as we know, they are very attached to their traditions and to diversity, as the French Agriculture Minister, Michel Barnier, recently reminded us.
Secondly, it is an industrial decision.
I have already mentioned the production methods, laws and high standards observed in Europe.
A good trade deal must also be fair.
The Commission stands no chance of convincing us that importing 300 000 tonnes of chlorinated chicken, without any compensation, is good news for the European poultry industry.
Finally, it is a political decision.
Now I am coming to the crux of the matter, as it is above all a question of confidence: confidence among producers and consumer confidence.
Given the current climate, can the Commission really allow itself to scorn - and I am coming to an end, Mr President the opinion of the Council, of Parliament, of operators on the ground and of a good number of your own Members?
I think that just asking the question is an answer in itself.
<D>
I would like to say that I am speaking as the shadow rapporteur for the opinion.
The current financial crisis has highlighted the lack of effective management of crisis situations which have arisen in cross-border financial entities in the EU.
There have been different approaches adopted at national level.
In general, the authorities have either used public funds to bail out the banks or they have isolated the banks' assets in their own country, applying national instruments to tackle crisis situations, but only at the level of their own branches.
These actions have heightened the risks associated with the loss of confidence, distortion of competition, legal uncertainty and the high level of costs incurred for bailing out the banks, borne by taxpayers.
Finally, we need measures at European level to stop the management of crises involving a cross-border banking group using national systems, which may be extremely different, and which tend to protect branches located on their own territory and not resolve the problem faced by the group as a whole.
<D>
in writing. - (FR) I voted for the Christensen report because it adopts an appropriate and widely supported approach to combining flexibility and security in manner.
It makes it very clear that a flexible labour market can go hand in hand with job security.
The term 'flexicurity' is often demonised, but in this report we have managed to overcome the negative connotations of what should be a guiding principle for employment policy in Europe.
Job creation is vitally important for combating unemployment in Europe, which remains too high despite the progress made in recent years.
Flexicurity gives us a realistic prospect of achieving the aims of the Lisbon Strategy.
If we are to do so, we have to find ways of facilitating access to employment and of training a skilled, flexible, mobile and motivated labour force.
Having a job is the best protection against all forms of social exclusion.
Europe must encourage the Member States to facilitate access to employment for those trying to enter or re-enter the labour market.
All legislation on employment and working conditions is a matter for the Member States, and I support the amendments which strengthen the principle of subsidiarity.
<D>
(CS) Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the collapse of the airline company SkyEurope has focused attention on the general problem of poor consumer protection for airline company passengers.
This is no virtual problem - I have had the opportunity to meet a number of customers affected by the collapse of this airline company in person.
They were, by coincidence, guests from the French twin town of Chateau d'Ain, who had come for a meeting in Kroměříž in the east of the Czech Republic, which is the town I represent.
Their return journey was a very frustrating experience, involving an enforced one-day stopover at Prague airport.
I mention this experience in order to emphasise that SkyEurope was not a normal low-cost airline.
It offered its passengers similar services to those of a traditional airline and flew to major airports.
Its services were used by a wide range of customers.
For customers whose primary concern was not the date of the trip but rather the cost of the ticket, SkyEurope was the preferred choice in the Czech Republic.
The SkyEurope company was also one the most important clients for Prague-Ruzyně, the Czech Republic's largest airport.
The collapse of SkyEurope, however, affected not only people at airports, but also 280 000 other clients who had bought tickets.
According to the information available, air tickets were being sold right up to the moment when bankruptcy was declared.
People who did not purchase tickets with a credit card have practically no chance of recovering their money.
Airline companies have no legal obligation to insure against a collapse and so some of them do not take out such insurance.
Passengers must therefore make their claims in bankruptcy proceedings.
The chances of getting money back in this way are negligible.
It is therefore time to do something about this.
I would like to thank the Committee on Transport for taking ownership of this issue and the Commission for promising to deal with it.
I am confident that a solution will be put forward that will boost customer confidence in the air transport sector, which has been so dramatically affected by the global economic crisis.
<D>
Madam President, I should just like to acknowledge how patient you have been during these explanations of vote.
Thank you very much for laughing at some of the jokes as well.
You may be aware that I represent London, the greatest city in the world, capital of the greatest country in the world.
In London there are a number of educational institutions.
I myself went to school in London; I went to the London School of Economics to do my Master's course.
However, what I would like to say in regard to this particular explanation of vote is that we should not underestimate the role of the further education sector in lifelong learning.
In particular, there are some very excellent institutions: Bromley College, with its excellent head, Peter Jones - I would like to put that on record - and Westminster College.
We all deserve a say on the referendum on the Constitution.
<D>
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, the Polish electoral law on elections to the European Parliament is truly unfair and undemocratic compared to the law on elections to the national parliament.
The forfeiture of a seat of a deputy to the European Parliament by laws of eligibility is an easy way to put pressure on political opponents and gives the opportunity to settle an account politically with those who have more authority.
Unfortunately, although being in the European Union, the law is still abused in many former Communist countries.
This is the case for Mr Tomczak as well.
As Members of the European Parliament, Polish MEPs represent not only the Poles but also all Europeans.
It is unacceptable that these people's representatives are discriminated against by maintaining different legislation with regard to Members of the Polish Parliament.
A Polish MEP, if convicted, will be punished not only by Polish law but will also lose his seat as a Member of the European Parliament.
That fact clearly shows the discrimination of Polish Members of the European Parliament in comparison to members of national parliaments.
That situation is unacceptable and shows clearly how unjust and unfair the Polish electoral law is.
May I urge Poland to change its electoral law?
<D>
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the compromise the PSE Group reached with the Council (Amendment 46), because it allows the balances struck during the German Presidency last spring to be maintained.
I am pleased that the consumer credits defined in this draft directive have a minimum of 200 euros and a maximum of 75 000 euros.
However, I would have preferred the upper limit to be set at 50 000 euros.
I am particularly pleased about the qualified majority obtained in plenary to ensure that the interests of consumers are clearly protected in the event of early repayment of the credit.
The compensation banks may demand will be strictly controlled and may be prohibited for credits of less than 10 000 euros.
In any case, the fight against people taking on too much debt should remain a priority and resorting to credit should be done in a reasonable manner.
It is an illusion to think that you can revive consumption through credits to households: this approach leads only to poverty for the most vulnerable consumers.
The revival of growth through consumption is achieved by raising pay and not by increasing available credit!
<D>
Mr President, Georgia is not just another international crisis to which the EU has to respond.
It signals Russia's military comeback, heralded by its offensive energy supply policy initiated in 2006.
The EU is caught between principles and economic interests.
Upholding the former would imply a readiness to sacrifice the latter.
Conversely, giving priority to the latter would imply a major loss of face.
In its turn, Russia is equally caught between the profits from its energy sales to the West and respect for international legality.
The latter cannot be disrespected with impunity.
That is the message our leaders should convey to Moscow loudly and clearly.
It would be a major waste for the entire international community if Russia chose to invest its newly-acquired energies in a futile attempt to restore the bipolar world, instead of associating itself with shaping the new, multipolar, globalised one.
<D>
in writing. - Despite the disappointment of Copenhagen, some good progress was made, including the short-term financing we secured for developing countries.
Not only will this provide concrete help on the ground; it will also help to build trust between partners who were divided at Copenhagen.
In the coming months and years, we have to show the developing world that we will honour our commitments to funding for adaptation and mitigation, and we need to be sure that the funds are spent in the best possible way in order to achieve their objectives.
Essential progress was also made in Copenhagen regarding monitoring, reporting and verification.
These link directly to building trust, because such a system will enable us to see that everyone is playing their part and will allow us to determine the effectiveness of our policies and how we should adapt them in the future.
The European Union needs to continue to implement its Emission Trading Scheme and other initiatives, such as energy reductions in buildings.
We need to meet our emissions targets and show how we can all benefit from energy savings.
Providing a successful example of an emission reduction policy which translates into benefits for ordinary people is the best way of convincing others to follow.
<D>
in writing. - (BG) Mr President, it is great that the EP is discussing the White Paper on Sport.
We should pay attention to the need for balancing the policies aimed at the development of professional and amateur sport.
Sport excellence costs a lot, but it is equally necessary to increase the funding of mass sport from childhood to retirement age.
It is necessary to establish infrastructure enabling the integration of all social groups of citizens.
Sport calls for education from an early age and sport is instrumental in eliminating many other problems such as the abuse of drugs, alcohol, and tobacco.
We should urge all Member States to set up areas for free sport and areas free of drugs, alcohol and tobacco.
I have recently made a public opinion poll which makes it very clear that young people engaged in sport do not use drugs and alcohol.
Their behavioural culture is very different; tolerance and solidarity are very important elements that sport nurtures in them.
Therefore the involvement of education in sport is of special significance.
There is also something else that I would like to share with you: there exist specialised sport schools and it is very important for their activities to be balanced with the work of sport clubs recruiting their athletes.
It is necessary to have legislative regulation to this effect for both sport and education.
<D>
in writing. - (LT) The EU and the USA have many points of contact and are playing a dominant role in solving global problems.
However, we must learn good practice from each other and strengthen our partnership in order to ensure the effectiveness of actions.
These problems are relevant as far as climate change, a healthy environment and food security are concerned.
The huge ecological disaster in the Gulf of Mexico offered hope that the US Government will take appropriate steps to ensure care for the environment and work towards solving the challenges of climate change.
The EU must play an active role at the Climate Change conference in Cancún.
It is important for the USA to become part of this agreement because sometimes, there is the impression that it would be easier to reach an agreement with developing countries than with the USA.
We must find ways of promoting links between the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) and regional or federal trading schemes in the US.
We must also seek a transatlantic partnership on strategic energy issues - on security of energy supply and policies to move towards low carbon energy sources.
One issue of transatlantic cooperation concerns a healthy environment - novel foods and the use of new technologies in food production.
EU society is not completely prepared for innovations, so countries must respect each other's choices.
A strong EU-US partnership must be beneficial to both sides and in a global context.
I hope that the forthcoming EU-US summit will represent a step towards this goal.
<D>
(FR) Mr President, if Mrs Kauppi does not arrive she is allowing me to use her two minutes, since she is hosting an important dinner-debate.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report by our Liberal colleague Olle Schmidt relates to a new confrontation between the House and the European Commission, which has proposed an unjustifiable increase in indirect taxes.
This proposal was made by a Commissioner that I feel has completely lost touch with economic reality.
Mr Kovács suggests a considerable increase in the minimum rates for unleaded petrol and gas oil.
In view of the record inflation, a cause of great concern to the European Central Bank, and the economic downturn we are currently witnessing, it seems to me that this is a particularly bad time to increase the excise duty rate on gas oil and fuel oil.
Personally, I must say that I would simply have rejected this uninspiring proposal by the Commission, but majority situations being what they are in the House I was unable to do so.
I support the compromise reached by the EP's main political groups as I feel it constitutes an exercise in damage limitation.
The gradual increase of minimum rates for diesel to 359 euro for 1 000 litres until 2015 and a freeze on minimum rates for the same amount of unleaded petrol, as stipulated in the compromise, are clearly below the levels proposed by the Commission.
The Commission was, in fact, suggesting 380 euro for both diesel and unleaded petrol by 2014.
The rapporteur wanted to go even further in his report and was seeking minimum levels of 400 euro.
I welcome the willingness to compromise on the part of our rapporteur, who brought the rates down during the discussions on his report in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
The real meat of this report is to be found in Amendment 19, in my opinion.
Here we require the Member States, now applying exorbitant excise duty of over 400 euro for 1 000 litres of diesel and 500 euro for 1 000 litres of unleaded petrol, not to increase these rates any further until 2015.
Therefore, without going so far as to introduce maximum rates in the proposal, for the Commission has never had the courage to propose these, we are at the very least expressing the desire for price alignment.
Mr President, there is only one way to ensure harmonisation of excise duty rates in Europe: introducing maximum and minimum rates at the same time.
It serves no purpose to continue to increase minimum rates and make no effort to curtail the enthusiasm of the Member States that insist on applying extremely high rates.
Finally, if you will allow me, Mr President, I would like to make a point of order.
I want to ask the Commissioner, who claimed we support his proposal, whether he lives on another planet, because we do not in fact support his proposal.
<D>
Mr President, the German Qimonda corporation, one of the largest memory chip manufacturers, has declared bankruptcy.
During the last year, it received EUR 325 million in subsidies, which proved to be inadequate.
In 2007, Qimonda employed 13 500 people.
In December last year, they took a 10 to 15% cut in their salaries, based on reassurances that the underpayment would be made up to them by April this year.
Instead, 500 workers lost their jobs overnight.
They have not received salaries or compensation for leave not taken or the severance pay owed them.
Another 500 will lose their jobs in the coming month, with a further 1 500 workers threatened further down the line.
There are many more such enterprises in our countries, including those in Krośno or Stalowa Wola in Poland.
What we expect from the Commission is a coherent programme for the protection of jobs during the crisis.
<D>
(SL) We have to do everything we can to prevent such accidents from happening.
So I expect the European Union to establish why it is that accidents are still happening in the European Union, and then, to take appropriate action.
Certainly, we need to address more seriously the implementation of the legislation we have already adopted.
Studies of individual accidents have shown that, among other reasons, they took place because of negligence and a failure to comply with the law.
In general, we have achieved very little in the way of implementing environmental legislation in the Union.
Furthermore, I expect the Commission to provide some information about any future cross-border risks to human health as a result of the accident in Hungary.
For instance, will toxic substances migrate into the air and will people living in neighbouring countries, such as Slovenia, be in any danger if they inhale them?
We must also call polluters to greater account and strictly apply the 'polluter pays' principle.
Using public funds to clean up the damage and to assist people should be a last resort only, under the principle of solidarity.
That is another way of encouraging business owners to operate safely.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, today's debate illustrates Parliament's high level of interest and concern regarding patient safety.
It also sends a signal that this is an area of great potential for EU added value.
For the most part, the Commission welcomes the proposed amendments: for example we welcome the proposal for Member States to designate competent authorities for patient safety at the various levels of state and local government administration.
This reflects the fact that some Member States have devolved systems of health care.
We also agree that the scale and cost of data collection should not be disproportionate to the expected benefits.
In relation to proposed amendments specific to health-care-associated infections, we welcome the provision for adequate protection for health-care staff.
We also support the highlighting of the morbidity and mortality burden of health-care-associated infections and the need to recruit more infection-control nurses.
However, I must raise some reservations and objections concerning the reduction of targets.
Some suggested that Member States should provide the means necessary to bring about a 20% reduction in the number of persons affected by adverse events, including an overall reduction in the EU of 900 000 cases each year.
The Commission does not think it is appropriate to set such targets at EU level as Member States are at different stages and it would be very difficult to set suitable, realistic and achievable targets that would be appropriate for them all.
I have taken very careful note of what Ms McAvan said about needle-stick injuries and I will think about a proposal for a special initiative.
Minister Filipiová made a reference to the responsibility of Member States in this aspect.
Our initiative on patient safety and health-care-associated infections fully respects the Member States' competence to finance structure and deliver health services as they see fit.
The purpose of our proposal is to help Member States to put in place the proper and adequate strategies to reduce or avoid adverse events in health care, including health-care-associated infections, by pooling the best available evidence and expertise in the EU and lending Commission support to achieving economies of scale in this area.
Once this patient safety recommendation is adopted in the Council, it will signal an unprecedented political commitment from Member State governments to prioritise patient safety in their health-care policies.
Action to reduce adverse events of all types, including health-care-associated infections in all health-care settings and in all EU Member States, is a goal we all share.
This proposal can play a big part in achieving this goal.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - (EL) I would like to thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak today on this very important issue.
The package of measures on climate and energy proposed by the Commission is one of the most significant initiatives undertaken by the European Union during the past years.
With these measures, the European Union will not only meet its environmental goals but at the same time it will make a decisive contribution to the new international agreements to combat climate change.
Adopting this package of measures on climate and energy is necessary in order for the European Union to maintain its international credibility.
Today's discussion coincides with the International Convention on Climate, taking place in Poznań, Poland.
It is therefore inevitable that today's audience includes the European Union as well as the Poznań negotiators and the international community in general.
The measures will facilitate the European Union's transition to a low carbon emissions economy.
Furthermore, it will give European industry the opportunity to play a leading international role in clean technologies and will therefore give it a competitive advantage.
The current economic crisis cannot become a reason for apathy; on the contrary, it is a further incentive for us to take measures on climate change.
It is in times such as the current financial crisis that we need to make the consumption and production of natural resources and products more cost effective and efficient.
Moreover, by saving energy and improving our energy supply, we can boost the European Union's energy security by reducing oil and natural gas imports.
The move to a low carbon emissions economy will encourage innovation, will provide new investment opportunities and will create new green jobs.
This is the reason why the package of measures on climate change and energy is part of the solution to today's crisis.
It provides the basis for a new, green deal that will enhance the competitiveness of the European industry at international level.
I would like to thank the European Parliament, the Presidency and the Council for their excellent cooperation with the Commission both on the package of measures on climate change and energy as well as on relevant proposals for cars and carbon dioxide and the directive on fuel quality.
There has been significant progress on the various issues that concern us and I am sure that we will reach an agreement at first reading.
The final agreements must maintain the whole architecture of the Commission proposal and our environmental goals, as well as guarantee fair effort sharing among Member States.
I would like to comment briefly on the revision of the greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme.
In order to achieve our environmental goals, the ceilings in the emissions trading scheme must guarantee a 21% emission reduction by 2020 in comparison to the 2005 levels.
This is a key point of the Commission's proposal.
I would like to say a few words on the issue regarding the risk of carbon dioxide leakage.
The international agreement on climate change is the most effective way of tackling that danger.
Any solutions to be agreed upon in the package of measures, need to support the international agreement on the one hand, and need to be workable.
The discussion regarding this issue between the Council of Ministers, the European Parliament and the Commission is still continuing at a fast pace.
I believe that a satisfactory solution will be found that will totally respect the environmental goals of the Commission proposal.
Regarding the system for effort sharing among the Member States outside the trading scheme, the Council and the European Parliament have made significant progress on a number of issues.
One of the main issues in our discussion was to find an appropriate balance between the flexible and effective implementation of our goals.
The Commission has set the annual limit for the clean development mechanism to 3%, because in that way it achieves a balance between flexibility and emission reduction within the European Union.
This limit, in conjunction with the ability to trade emissions between Member States, will give countries the opportunity to achieve their goals.
The Commission believes that the flexibility to achieve the goals of the Member States must go hand in hand with a transparent and effective compliance system.
This principle has already been successfully applied in the European Union's emission trading scheme.
Finally, significant progress has also been made on the Commission's proposal to shape the legal framework on carbon capture and storage.
As far as the CCS funding is concerned, an issue in which Parliament has shown particular interest, discussions are already under way on the use of reserves for companies entering the emission trading scheme.
This is a positive development towards finding a solution.
Thank you very much and I await your opinions with interest.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - For any agency, my view is that direct financing through taxpayers' money is the best way because, with its own income, you can never guarantee that public service, exactly, is delivered.
So, I believe that the best way is for the budget to finance any agency, but if there is the possibility of supplementary funds being raised, it should be evaluated.
In any case, each budget is discussed according to the procedure and tough regulations imposed by European legislation.
Part two
Subject: Safety of nuclear power plant
The European Union is now being faced with the immediate problem of satisfying ever- increasing energy demand.
Given that oil and, natural gas supplies and renewable sources of energies can only meet some of this demand, the major role of nuclear energy in resolving the problem is undeniable.
At the same time, European citizens are becoming particularly anxious about the safety of nuclear power plant and proper nuclear waste management, particularly following recent leaks of radioactive material from nuclear plant in France and Slovenia.
It is therefore only natural that a large number of questions should arise concerning the safety of nuclear power plant in all EU countries and of the nuclear power plants to be constructed in Turkey and other Balkan countries and the guarantees provided concerning their safe operation.
Has the Commission made a survey of the need to build nuclear power stations?
What are its conclusions?
Finally, has it calculated the extent of EU dependency on nuclear energy in the near future?
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, I speak on behalf of my friend and former colleague in this Parliament, Mr Konstantinos Hatzidakis, who, as Mr Lehtinen says, has been elevated swiftly to the position of Minister of Transport in the Greek Government.
I want to pay tribute to him for the work he has done on the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection.
I am essentially picking up the work where he left off, right at the conclusion.
I want to thank Mr Lehtinen because it has not been recorded so far that this is his first report, I think, as a rapporteur.
Some of you may know that he is a distinguished author in his own right, though I think this is probably not his best work.
I do not think he will mind me saying that.
I have a copy of his book Blood, Sweat and Bears, which he gave me to read, and I think he has put a bit of blood and sweat into this.
It is an important report, but I have to say, from our side, we agree very much with the line that Ms Kauppi and Commissioner Reding have taken.
There is some useful material in here but I just want to reassure the Commissioner that, if she reads Article 22, which in my view is a masterpiece of compromise drafting, where it calls upon the Commission to continue work and to submit a work programme for an assessment, you will be pleased to hear it does not actually ask you to produce a horizontal instrument but to do a work programme to assess whether we need one.
You already confirmed, I think, what many of us feel - that with all the work that is currently going on to implement the Services Directive, the Green Paper on the consumer acquis, which we have just considered and which will result in a horizontal instrument in that area plus the other work that is going on - which my colleague from the Committee on Legal Affairs, Ms Kauppi, and I know Ms Wallis will cover later - I think it is much too early to contemplate any further detailed provisions at this stage.
It is absolutely clear that we do need to monitor this, but of course within the Services Directive itself, with all the work we put in it, there are a very substantial number of provisions.
One of the amendments that we hope the House will agree to delete tomorrow does actually call upon the Commission to draw up voluntary codes of conduct.
In my view that is not the Commission's role.
I think we will have support to delete that.
But in fact, if you look at the Services Directive, in Article 37 it actually says quite clearly that Member States, in cooperation with the Commission, shall take measures to encourage codes of conduct to be drawn up at Community level.
It is not as if we did not already have that.
So I think that we will take that out, so my summary of it is this: I think that this is a very useful contribution to the debate.
I think it will add to the corpus of information that we are building up to ensure, above all, that the Services Directive is fully implemented and is implemented on time, with all the accompanying provisions - particularly the issues like the single point of contact for service providers, which will give them the sort of requirements and information that they need to provide services plus, we hope, the sort of work on codes of conduct.
With those, I think we can look forward to a really effective and thriving services market that works to the benefit of consumers.
<D>
Madam President, Commissioner Špidla, I would like to start by thanking the Commissioner for his response and the committee for its initiative.
It is about time this issue was discussed in Parliament.
With the Treaty of Lisbon, issues relating to children will become objectives within the EU and will gain a legal basis.
A year ago, in anticipation of the Treaty, Parliament also adopted a children's strategy.
It is scandalous that children are left to live on their own at all.
Of course, a mother and father may be forced to move to find work or to find refuge, but we MEPs must take responsibility when we adopt such rules, for example, to the effect that only the applicant receives asylum and not his family, as it is most often the men who flee and the women and children who are left at home.
Or when employers import labour and do not ask or care whether there are children back home or they ignore the fact that this is the case.
I therefore fully support the demands made by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament in its question.
An impact assessment is an urgent and necessary requirement.
The Commission must act on the basis of the studies that the Commissioner himself has ordered, and quickly.
Better information must be produced on children's rights and schooling.
We must also provide information and ensure that children who are currently in this situation receive help.
We must include the parties concerned and NGOs and we must come up with proposals.
I also believe that the relatively new group of lone child refugees could also be included in the work described by the Commissioner.
Children should grow up with warmth and care and they are not something that the market should control.
We politicians have a duty and we must accept it, so give us child mainstreaming and give us child impact assessments in respect of this huge problem.
Otherwise, we will be forced to feel ashamed when we face the next generation.
<D>
Madam President, firstly, we too are dissatisfied with the outcome of the elections in Belarus, and we agree with the conclusion of the OSCE/ODIHR that the elections fell short of our European standards.
Therefore, there is absolutely no reason to change EU policy towards Belarus now.
We do agree that it is good to look at whether we can initiate dialogue with the Belarusian authorities on an informal basis, as has also been proposed by the French Presidency, on a possible follow-up.
Follow-up measures must chiefly originate on their side.
If Belarus is prepared to develop a dialogue with the European Union on the possibility of increasing freedom in its society, and to create elbow room, including for the opposition, the European Union will be able to respond.
Until then, I do not support lifting the existing sanctions against a number of leading figures in the country who are not permitted to enter the EU.
There have been a number of encouraging signs over recent months - these have already been mentioned by my fellow Members in this House - which indeed give cause to look at whether progress can be made by means of dialogue with the country.
Secondly, if the Foreign Minister, Sergei Martynov, is invited to talks in Luxembourg, I propose that the Council also contact the opposition.
There are two prominent representatives of the opposition here - Mr Kazulin and Mr Milinkevich.
Why has the Council not invited them, too, to talks?
On a final note, if dialogue is established with Belarus on possible reforms, we think it important that the opposition be involved.
There is a precedent: some seven years ago a kind of informal dialogue was held in Belarus itself, partly under the auspices of the European Parliament, which was called the Parliamentary Troika on Belarus.
It would be possible, if the Belarusian authorities were prepared to do so, to restart that dialogue via a kind of troika of the European Parliament, the OSCE and the Council of Europe.
After all, whatever we do in Europe, whatever discussions we hold, the opposition must be involved.
<D>
(FR) Mr President, the conflict between Georgia and Russia and the financial crisis have both been opportunities for the European Union to make its presence felt on the world stage as a fully-fledged first-rate political player.
Thanks to your determination, Mr Sarkozy, Europe has managed to come together to find coordinated, effective and speedy responses.
In the face of crisis, Europe has shown that it really exists and has demonstrated its added value.
With regard to immigration, for example, the 'every man for himself' principle was no longer in fashion.
The European Council's adoption of the pact on immigration and asylum, initiated by the French Presidency, represents a considerable step forward.
With respect to the fight against climate change, Europe needs to set itself concrete objectives and show its global partners the way.
You have already spoken on this subject, Mr Sarkozy, but we hope that this agreement will be as balanced as possible, because it needs to take account of the economic situations of our countries, which are currently very unstable.
We also, however, need to examine the issue of the type of growth we will choose for the future.
In order to face up to the challenges before it, the European Union now needs the Treaty of Lisbon more than ever.
We understand the concerns of the Irish, but keeping the status quo is not an option.
Ireland needs to propose a solution during the December European Council: there are many of us calling for that.
In recent weeks, we have looked on with pride at a strong political Europe, united in adversity, presenting a determined front to its partners, and listened to on the international stage.
We hope that this new European mentality will become the rule and will endure.
The Treaty of Lisbon is the best solution available to us to achieve that.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, thank you very much for the opportunity to contribute to this debate.
I am pleased, Mrs Kuneva, that at the request of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats you have been instrumental in getting the proposal relating to collective redress from the DG Competition, which to start with planned to regulate this according to the practice in the US, to be developed using a horizontal approach and to actually treat everyone equally within the European Union - small and medium-sized enterprises, consumers, workers and entrepreneurs.
This is an important step forward, which we wish to support in a very constructive and positive manner.
We are aware that in many individual cases, of course, a Community claim for the enforcement of collective rights appears to be more successful than individual enforcement.
However, we remain convinced that the way of skimming off summary actions that protects the consumer the most is not collective redress, but public enforcement of such claims, for example by means of a skimming claim as in the German Law against unfair competition, because individual consumers will consider very carefully whether in fact to file a collective action with a lawyer for EUR 4.99 or whether it would actually be more helpful if, for example, these claims were continually monitored at public level by an ombudsman and enforced by appropriate means.
Thus, with regard to the question of how to link these two elements, I believe that we need to consider carefully how we can help consumers in the most effective way, as consumers often do not have the time to go to a lawyer, but instead want to find help quickly and easily.
The second point that I see as important - and here, too, your Directorate General has done a very good job - is that the most interesting element was a discussion in the Bavarian representation in Brussels, where in response to the question of whether, by using European legal means, we can actually rule out the type of collective redress found in the US, a representative of your Directorate General clearly said 'no we cannot'.
That in our opinion means that we must not disregard this model completely.
We must continue to discuss it, but to do so with great care and to include the Member States and their legal options in the discussion so that ultimately we achieve what it is we all want, and that is a real European model that is particularly attractive to consumers and that also protects small and medium-sized enterprises.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, thank you for the opportunity to address Parliament, in its final week, on the global spread of the influenza A(H1N1) virus.
Let me first brief you on the current situation, and then on what the EU has been doing to manage this crisis.
The latest European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) report states that there are currently 94 confirmed cases of A(H1N1) influenza within the EU and EFTA countries, and 20 probable cases.
Most of these people have been to affected areas outside Europe, but not all.
Eight human-to-human transmissions have been reported, in one instance even to a health-care worker.
However, we may be glad that none of the patients infected with this virus in the EU has yet died.
For over a week we have observed the spread of infections in Mexico, in the USA, in Canada, in EU Member States and in other countries.
In Mexico the impact on public and economic life has grown to a serious scale.
We appreciate and acknowledge the enormous efforts the Mexican authorities have made to contain the spread of the virus and to help those suffering from infection.
EU legislation on communicable disease obliges Member States to report on such outbreaks and on the measures they propose to take to mitigate them.
The ECDC operates the surveillance networks which follow the number of cases reported.
We therefore have a fairly accurate picture across Europe of the developing situation, and this provides the basis for responsibly taking appropriate and effective decisions on how to best make use of our limited resources.
The worldwide picture of infection was severe enough to trigger the WHO to decide on 29 April to upgrade its pandemic alert to phase 5, recognising that human-to-human transmission had taken place in at least two regions.
The Commission has worked throughout in close contact and cooperation with the WHO.
My services are working hard to implement the actions to take, as defined by the Community pandemic influenza preparedness plan, in order to address the challenges posed by the current outbreak.
The Commission launched its public health operations facility on 24 April and since then my services have been at permanent operational level.
The Commission has called daily meetings of the Communicable Disease Network of Member States and of the EU Health Security Committee since Saturday 25 April.
These meetings review the epidemiological situation, discuss and decide on measures and on appropriate legislative acts.
Information for the public on how to prevent infection and to make informed choices about travel has been discussed to ensure a coherent message from all Member States, based on scientific advice by the ECDC, in coordination with the WHO.
We decided to extend the surveillance for seasonal flu, which should normally have ended at week 20, in order to identify infections with this new flu virus.
The Commission adopted on 30 April a legally binding case definition on the basis of the EU communicable disease legislation, and this decision was published in the Official Journal on 1 May.
Since medical countermeasures such as antivirals and vaccines are at the heart of our public health response to this threat, I met with the European manufacturers on Wednesday 29 April to learn the latest information on which products are in development, on timelines for new vaccines, and to see if EU intervention can speed up delivery.
With the Member States, we are examining how to best optimise the use of existing stocks of antivirals, using the coordination mechanism of the EU Health Security Committee.
I can also inform Parliament that, following my request to the Czech Presidency, the Health Council met on 30 April and adopted a set of strong conclusions reiterating the need for a coordinated response to the new influenza threat.
The Council recalled the legal obligation on Member States to coordinate their surveillance and response to health threats, and agreed that restricting travel to affected areas was not a justified public health response.
However, the Council also agreed that good public information was essential and that travellers should be able to make informed judgements.
The Commission is now examining a road map for the urgent implementation of the points included in the Council conclusions of 30 April.
These will include development of vaccines, vaccine strategy, guidance on best use of stockpiles of vaccines and antivirals, protective and preventative measures and public communication and information.
It is clear that we all benefit from our integrated European economy and society.
However, that benefit also brings a responsibility.
It means that we must work together to take only those measures that are justified by the evidence.
This is essential if we are to avoid a health crisis becoming an economic crisis as well.
But we should not focus unduly on the negative aspects of these events.
Thanks to the preparation led by the Commission after avian influenza a few years ago, the EU has the systems in place to respond collectively and effectively to this threat.
I know that in recent times, as the European elections approach, this House has debated what Europe really means for citizens.
In these difficult days, I think we can see some things more clearly.
Europe means solidarity in standing together to face this threat.
It means cooperation, sharing information, expertise and capacity so that we can act together on the basis of the best available knowledge.
It means innovation, with European-funded research helping to bring a vaccine to production as quickly as possible.
It means capability, through the European institutions enabling all Member States to respond immediately and effectively to a shared crisis.
That is what Europe brings to citizens.
So, yes, the situation is serious but we are better prepared than ever to meet this threat.
And having seen the determination of the health ministers of Europe last week - and all 27 were there - I am confident of our ability to respond in the coming weeks.
<D>
Madam President, as we know, many dangerous chemical substances are authorised for general use, in spite of the dangerous ingredients they contain.
One of these substances is dichloromethane (DCM), which is generally used for manufacturing pharmaceuticals, solvents and other products.
It is a substance that is particularly harmful to human health, as it is classified as a carcinogen.
It damages the nervous system and causes serious damage to internal organs, which can directly lead to death.
In view of their higher respiratory rate, children are more susceptible to dichloromethane poisoning, as are people with cardiovascular diseases.
It also alarming that there have been deaths linked to dichloromethane poisoning.
In view of the fact that we know that there are products on the market which could provide an alternative to products containing dichloromethane, as well as the fact that certain Member States have banned the use of this substance, introducing a total ban on its usage seems essential.
A further argument in favour of banning DCM should be the fact that, as experts have pointed out, we cannot ensure that consumers will use DCM safely.
The Commission's proposal to introduce training on the use of products containing DCM for professional purposes will cost approximately EUR 1.9 billion in its first year of implementation.
Withdrawing DCM from general circulation therefore seems to be the most sensible and responsible solution.
<D>
This report assesses and makes positive changes to the European Commission's proposal for amending this regulation, which itself changed the period for awarding State aid to the coal industry.
Without this amendment, the period would have expired on 31 December 2010.
Now, the European Commission's new proposal is suggesting extending aid until 2014.
However, the European Parliament has adopted a proposal, for which we voted, extending aid until 2018.
The purpose of this is to take the social problem - preventing redundancies of workers and difficulties integrating them into the labour market - and the environmental problem into account, together with the aid that it advocates to resolve these problems.
The commitment to safeguarding the maintenance of coal industries that have become competitive during the course of this process, while also ensuring that environmental and public health issues are safeguarded, is also positive.
The need to rehabilitate former coal mining sites is also stressed, specifically: the removal of old mining equipment from the mine, making it safe, cleaning the site and disposing of waste water.
<D>
(DE) Madam President, I do apologise for my late arrival.
There are some very long distances to walk in this building and the lifts can be very slow sometimes.
The matter we are discussing today and will vote on tomorrow is not necessarily a question of left or right - although it is true that we also have that type of debate in this Chamber - but rather a disputed question about what instruments will achieve our goal.
We are agreed on the goal, and Mrs Niebler has just underlined it: we want more competition on the European market; we want prices to be more transparent; we want pricing that is easy to understand.
The instruments to achieve this vary greatly, however.
I am among those who proceed on the basis that the option of finding a third way can also be an instrument.
We have included these suggestions here and emphasised repeatedly that this has not only initiated the third way, the Council's original suggestion, but that we have also introduced additional regulatory components because the third way that came to us from the Council was not enough for us.
From this angle, we should talk about it again, take stock of ourselves and allow this second and third way as an additional option.
What is even more important is that we in Europe achieve uniform regulations, and that the regulatory authorities in the Member States are given consistent competences and independence to implement what we decide here, because in the end, they are the ones who have to respond on the ground.
Recent weeks have given us two succinct examples of the Commission's function of overseeing cartels and competition, although the timing does allow pause for thought.
However, a company that violates antitrust law deserves to be punished; that is all there is to it.
I do not make any concessions here.
Nevertheless, we should discuss whether ownership unbundling is really the instrument we should be equipping ourselves and the regulators with, or whether we should offer more flexibility.
I hope that tomorrow's vote will be such that we still achieve a compromise.
Otherwise, we will definitely have to work with the Council to seek and find a compromise.
Thank you very much and apologies again for being late.
<D>
Opinions inside and outside this House on the inclusion of self-employed drivers within the scope of the Health and Safety at Work Directive in the area of road transport vary widely.
Everyone believes that they have good arguments to back up their opinions and I respect that.
However, there are already too few self-employed people in Europe and those people who are still prepared to take the risk of self-employment should not be discouraged or demotivated.
This is what we will be doing if we start to regulate the working time of self-employed people in Europe.
It is true that there is the phenomenon of 'false' self-employed people, but not only in the transport industry.
This is a general problem throughout the labour market, which must be treated as such, as the rapporteur has so rightly said.
Most people use the argument of road safety, but the driving hours of commercial drivers are strictly regulated.
The speedometer does not know whether a self-employed person or an employee is sitting behind the wheel.
However, it makes no difference whether a self-employed person who is tired after doing paperwork or an employee or driver who is tired for one of any number of other reasons is in charge of the vehicle.
Restrictive red tape for small independent businesses is the last thing we currently need in Europe.
Therefore, I have voted in favour of the report.
<D>
(RO) The purpose of the Industrial Emissions Directive is to reduce the polluting emissions from 52 000 industrial installations across the EU, operating in different industrial sectors.
Installations which come under the remit of this directive must be authorised.
The permits issued must include emission limit values which must be observed, as well as operating conditions specified on the basis of the best available techniques.
In order to obtain these permits, companies in the relevant industrial sectors should also submit an investment plan guaranteeing that their industrial installations will be modernised in order to reduce polluting emissions.
I think that this directive should be linked to the European Union's industrial policy.
The directive should provide sufficient flexibility enabling European industry to be modernised so that we can maintain industrial output and jobs in the European Union, while still reducing polluting emissions.
Finally, I call on the Commission to consult Parliament and Member States right at the early stages of drafting the decisions for setting the emission limit values associated with the best available techniques, and not just after they have been adopted by the Commission.
<D>
in writing. - (HU) In order to achieve their environmental aims the Member States nowadays give preference almost exclusively to direct regulation, even though there are many other regulatory instruments available.
We feel more focus should be given to market-based environmental protection incentives.
We believe that the concepts of the market, competition and protection of the environment are not mutually exclusive.
The significance of market incentives is that the aim of environmental quality can be achieved more cheaply and more effectively with them, and other social objectives can be achieved at the same time.
Unfortunately, the European Union has not done much to encourage market-based incentives, though the emissions trading scheme could be given as an exception.
It is therefore comforting that the Green Paper contains a survey of hidden opportunities for these topical incentives.
We might add, however, that the survey should have gone a lot further.
A wider use of market-based regulation should go hand in hand with a reduction in ineffective direct regulation.
Since economic incentives are income-generating, we have to examine just how these instruments, primarily imposed on labour, can generate taxes.
This subject warrants intensive debate.
We are also convinced that the EU's ambitious environment policy objectives cannot be fulfilled without going further in the field of market incentives.
<D>
At the moment, less than 1% of the European Union's budget goes on innovation.
This is the current state of affairs at a time when Europe has realised that its future lies within the knowledge triangle of research-innovation-education.
The European Parliament's request to increase the resources allocated to innovation is absolutely justified in these circumstances.
We are approaching the time for looking at the financial projections for the 2014-2020 period and must take this request into consideration.
Transforming Europe's economy into a sustainable economy must make European companies more competitive and allow new opportunities to emerge for national economies as a result of the economic and ecological challenges facing Europe.
Moreover, and especially against the backdrop of the financial crisis and the credit crunch, it is crucially important for companies' innovative capacity that more funding should be made available at both EU and national level and that appropriate financial instruments should be created.
Splitting resources across a host of objectives and a series of specific EU initiatives has not produced satisfactory results so far.
Funding must be directed at those areas where the boomerang effect is greatest.
The key criterion here must be added value for Europe.
<D>
(ET) Ladies and gentlemen, the harassment of the Director of the St Petersburg Office of the British Council, Mr Kinnock, and his colleagues going as far as questioning by the Russian authorities requires our full attention.
The charges levelled at the British Council are a link in the chain to which the cyber attacks against Estonia, the blockade of Polish food products and the radioactive attack in London also belong.
In each case the Kremlin has innocently claimed that the incident was an isolated one.
Ladies and gentlemen, such a high number of isolated incidents points to a system.
The Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Lavrov, said explicitly last Thursday that the reform of Europe's security architecture is a priority in Russia's foreign policy for 2008.
Russia wants to reform the European Union by paralysing our foreign policy and by squeezing us in an energy vice between the North Stream and the South Stream.
As we do not wish to become the undefended target of a strong Russian foreign policy, we must stand firm together in solidarity.
We in the European Parliament must condemn the harassment of the British Council.
<D>
Nowadays, there is an ever-increasing number of women becoming involved in politics and making major decisions in companies.
In 2006, 32.6% of managers in the EU were women.
The percentage of women in the European Parliament rose from 16.3% in 1979, when the first European elections took place, to 31% in 2009.
However, it still seems necessary to adopt and apply a gender mainstreaming strategy incorporating specific targets in all Community policies which come under the remit of parliamentary committees and delegations.
I support the need for the parliamentary committees and delegations to have at their disposal appropriate means for gaining a sound understanding of gender mainstreaming, including indicators, data and statistics broken down by gender, and for budgetary resources to be allocated with a view to ensuring gender equality.
All these options must encourage the continual exchange of good practice, with the aim of implementing the integrated strategy for combining family life and work life and facilitating the career development of female employees.
As a social-democrat, I believe that this is an excellent initiative for transferring to national parliaments the positive model offered by the EP on gender equality (11% of the members of the Romanian parliament are women).
<D>
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, on 18 June 2007 the Council reiterated its position that the comprehensive proposal drawn up by President Martti Ahtissari, UN Special Envoy, provides the basis for the settlement of the Kosovo issue by a new resolution of the United Nations Security Council.
The European Council expressed its support for intensified efforts to ensure that the UN Security Council can adopt such a resolution in a timely manner.
As you are aware, the UN Security Council consultations on a new resolution are currently suspended, but the UN Security Council is very alert to this issue.
In a statement in August the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, highlighted the initiative of the Contact Group for new negotiations between Pristina and Belgrade to be led by a Troika comprising representatives of the European Union, the Russian Federation and the United States.
The UN Secretary-General asked the Contact Group to report back to him by 10 December.
The intention behind this new period of negotiations is that the Troika will play a facilitating role, with the parties being responsible for proposing new ideas.
As you know, on 29 July 2007 the Secretary-General and High Representative, Mr Solana, appointed Ambassador Wolfgang Ischinger as the EU's representative in the Troika.
So far the Troika has met separately with the parties on 10 and 11 August in Belgrade and Pristina, on 30 August in Vienna, and on 18 and 19 September in London.
At the ministerial-level Contact Group meeting, which will take place on 27 September in New York alongside the UN General Assembly, ministers will discuss the state of the negotiations and must issue a statement aimed at giving significant impetus to this process.
On 28 September, also in New York, further separate meetings will be held between the Troika and the parties, possibly followed by an initial direct meeting between the parties on the same day.
As Mr Solana has highlighted, it is now essential that the parties cooperate constructively in this process and conduct substantial negotiations.
On the conclusion of the Troika process, the UN Secretary-General must present a report to the UN Security Council on this issue.
As you must realise, at this stage it is still too early to predict the results of these processes.
<D>
(BG) I believe that the reports by Mr Danjean and Mr Albertini mark a step towards our much needed common vision for the European Union as a global player in safeguarding peace and security, and I congratulate them on this.
Dwindling defence budgets and the current economic crisis make it patently clear that if we want Europe to speak with a single voice in the world and send out strong signals commanding respect, we must use the available resources more prudently and efficiently.
The role of the European Defence Agency, which has been strengthened by the Treaty of Lisbon, is vitally important for maximising our potential through collective procurement, pooling resources and joint training.
The interaction between the civilian and military aspects of the Common Foreign and Security Policy must be used to improve our Union's capabilities and effectiveness.
I expect to see Mrs Ashton, as Head of the European Defence Agency and High Representative, taking on an active role in this direction.
Finally, Mrs Ashton, I wish you every success in setting up the common External Action Service.
I expect the principle of geographical balance to be observed when appointing the service's staff so that it can truly represent the whole European Union.
Europe needs you to be successful.
<D>
in writing. - (FR) It is a known fact that Europe wants to take care of everything and be everywhere.
With this resolution on migrant children left behind in the country of origin, the European Parliament has reached the height of madness with proposals which are not only demagogic, but also aim at turning the Member States into the guilty parties.
We are told that the Union has paid insufficient attention to the phenomenon of children left behind in their countries when their parents migrate.
The Member States should implement measures aimed at improving the situation of these children left behind and guarantee them normal development, in terms of their education and social life.
It is like being in a dream!
After the measures encouraging the reuniting of families in the receiving countries and right of abode for the families themselves, now it is time for measures for the children who do not migrate.
The problem of immigration will not be solved like this.
The logic is wrong.
It is not the children who stay behind who should be helped; it is the families and the entire populations from these countries who should be helped and encouraged to stay at home.
<D>
rapporteur. - Mr President, let me present in conclusion certain ideas which I did not have the time to include in my introductory speech.
I am very pleased to see that over EUR 100 billion is to be invested in protecting the environment.
At the same time, I would seriously welcome a much higher allocation for energy efficiency and renewable energies - currently EUR 9 million - as well as a higher allocation for measures to combat climate change, which, at EUR 48 billion, is less than required at the moment.
I strongly believe that deciding on how we use these funds to protect our regions and combat the consequences of climate change, such as floods and droughts, will determine the future of our regions and their economic positioning.
I also greatly appreciate the fact that all Member States have already devoted a significant amount of their total financial allocations to investments in research, development and innovation, but I have also noticed that, for most of the EU convergence regions, ensuring accessibility remains a significant problem as they face a lack of transport infrastructure.
On the other hand, I am glad to witness Member States' efforts to prioritise investments aimed at increasing labour participation and improving skills, as well as fighting against poverty and social exclusion in their programmes financed by the European social funds.
Furthermore, I encourage new Member States to continue to build up effective partnerships and to consistently reinforce the partnership principle while implementing the operational programmes.
I believe that the new Member States could truly benefit from further exchanges of best practices and knowledge about developments in technologies, for example, and from other common actions to speed up their potential as regards implementation.
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, in my mind's eye I see a beautiful country.
I see people struggling to emerge from the aftermath of the civil war atrocities.
I see those memorials to the violence.
I see poor people struggling to cope.
I see Bujumbura closed at night, as one tries to get back in before the curfew because of the violence.
I see the health problems, the malaria, the respiratory and hygiene problems.
I see the refugee camps - people returning, not quite knowing where their homes were, people coming back from Tanzania and people coming across from Kivu in the Congo.
And now again of course we see the violence, the FNL breaking their agreements.
We again see the allegations of torture and rough treatment.
Burundi needs our help.
It also needs self-restraint if it is never again to slip down that slope of intolerance and inhumanity.
<D>
(BG) Thank you, Mr President.
I voted for the report because I believe it to be exceptionally important.
Resolving the wide variety of problems that arise when children use communications technologies in a single document is difficult.
This programme is necessary on organisational grounds, however.
When debating the impact of the new technologies, we tend to speak of the social, educational, cultural and other benefits and only become aware of the negative effects too late in the day.
The existing mechanisms for restricting products which have a negative influence are very important in minimising the risk, but we need to have preventive programmes running alongside these.
The point, now that we have a common European Programme, is for each Member State to have its own national programme in this regard.
We need to increase society's awareness of the problem, and teach children to use ICT intelligently.
Another thing we need to address is the danger of "computer dependence”.
Integrated efforts are needed, and that is another role that national governments have to play.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Following the request of Member States and stakeholders, the Commission proposed the Regulation on Nutrition and Health Claims, which was adopted in December 2006 by Parliament and the Council.
The aim of the Regulation is precisely to ensure that nutrition and health claims made on foods are truthful, clear and based on generally accepted scientific evidence, so that the consumer is adequately protected.
The Commission therefore aims to establish lists of permitted health claims as well as to update permitted nutrition claims.
The regulation sets authorisation procedures to ensure that only scientifically substantiated health claims are made.
These procedures involve firstly the European Food Safety Authority, which assesses the substantiation of health claims; secondly, the Commission, which proposes draft measures authorising or rejecting health claims accordingly; and thirdly, the Member States, which give their opinion on the measures in the regulatory committee.
The Commission has so far adopted four regulations authorising or rejecting health claims.
Similar measures will continue to be adopted according to the evaluation of the health claims from the European Food Safety Authority, thereby ensuring that consumers are not misled.
<D>
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, under the new system the rapporteur has the last word, and therein lies an insight into how the European Parliament sees itself in relation to the Commission.
As you know, we are not at odds about the next steps in this matter.
I am not suggesting that the system be scrapped; I have merely proposed a few improvements - which I do not intend to recapitulate - to increase Parliament's powers of scrutiny.
On the question of data that can be used for climate analysis, we have indicated that there are two pilot projects, entitled LUCAS and MARS.
This also demonstrates, however, that the data being collected does indeed transcend the domain of agriculture.
This is why I asked in the explanatory statement for the retention of a separate budget heading.
Let me conclude with a little anecdote that shows the sort of thing we must deal with.
A farm near where I live was visited by the supervisory authority, because the satellite system had allegedly enabled it to identify a gully, in other words a prohibited drainage system.
The inspectors said it must be over there in a particular spot where the system had shown it to be.
The farmer, however, assured them that he had done nothing.
And what had actually happened?
A plastic mat was lying in the field - which should not happen either - and the grass had grown through it.
That was what the satellite system had picked up, and now the authorities had come to haul the farmer over the coals.
We politicians could surely come up with more little tales like that from our local areas - and no doubt, Commissioner, you have heard a few yourself - which illustrate what we have to deal with.
There is no point in denying our concern at the prospect of farmers being monitored in a way which the public cannot comprehend and which is no longer subject to parliamentary scrutiny.
I therefore hope you will appreciate why we have had to put this report through Parliament and discuss it and why we must continue to be vigilant in future.
Be that as it may, we do intend to support each other in these efforts.
<D>
in writing. - (DE) I am voting in favour of Marianne Mikko's report on concentration and pluralism in the media in the EU.
Access to free and diverse media in all Member States is vitally important these days.
The two-pillar model that was introduced for private and public television and audiovisual media services has developed very well.
So that this development process can continue as fruitfully as possible, stable funding must be provided for public broadcasting corporations, enabling them to promote public interests and social values, to preserve pluralism in the media and to give people access to high-quality content.
I also support the creation of a charter for media freedom.
This would be a bridgehead for efforts to guarantee freedom of expression.
Provision for the independence of journalists, however, must be made by means of specific legal and social guarantees.
The concentration of media ownership is also a problem, since it encourages the emergence of monopolies.
There is therefore a need to merge competition and media legislation in order to guarantee access, competition and quality.
The report more or less covers all the main points, and for this reason I am backing the rapporteur.
<D>
Madam President, the number of people seeking refugee and asylum status is growing alarmingly.
As the report states, there are currently about 12 million refugees and about 26 million internally displaced persons worldwide.
This is hardly surprising, as some countries in continents such as Africa and Asia slide further into political chaos and the world slips further into a financial and economic crisis of as yet unknown depths.
What we can be sure of is that over the coming months and years there will be yet more refugees and asylum-seekers.
It will surprise no-one that the European Parliament solution is harmonisation of national asylum systems.
The report proposes a common European asylum system and a common asylum support office with common standards for granting refugee and asylum status.
It proposes that national governments should not be able to hold an asylum-seeker in detention solely on the grounds that they are asylum applicants, and that refugees should be allowed to request movement from one European country to another.
It proposes that where an applicant is held in detention, that person should have the right to a remedy before a national court.
All this is a recipe for chaos and gridlock in national asylum systems.
Many, if not most, of those people who seek refugee and asylum status in European countries far from home are, of course, economic migrants seeking a better life.
And who can blame them?
But the easier we make it for them to come to Europe, the more will come.
The common systems proposed here will make it even harder for nation states to protect their own borders and easier for untold numbers of economic migrants to cross those borders.
Britain needs even stricter controls, not more lax ones imposed by the European Union.
<D>
(EL) Mr President, I shall likewise begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mrs Lienemann, on the excellent work she has done.
The directive aims to protect - as indeed it should - the marine environment.
However, as rapporteur for the Committee on Fisheries, there are a few things I would like to comment on.
The Committee on the Environment must put more emphasis on fishing and the problems facing it as a result of marine pollution.
Sailors and fishermen know the seas better than anyone.
They live on them and from them.
Their participation is needed in combating this problem.
I also wish to express my satisfaction at the enlargement of the protected marine areas.
To sum up, I shall say that success in safeguarding the marine strategy depends on four main factors: firstly, committing the parties to comply with the schedule laid down in the directive.
We cannot and must not allow postponements in our programme.
The targets must all be achieved by 2020.
If we do not achieve them then, it will be too late to remedy things.
Secondly, cooperation with third countries: the seas have no borders.
We should get round the table together and discuss things with all our neighbours.
Let us not forget that there are 27 countries around the Mediterranean, and only seven of them are Member States.
We should therefore all sit down together and see what we can do.
Thirdly, there should be adequate funds allocated for this purpose.
Fourthly, we should get fishermen to participate in this effort.
This is our only hope of success.
To conclude and round off these comments, I shall repeat that the Directive on Marine Strategy, if correctly applied, will contribute to viable, sustainable fisheries and a healthy sea, so that we have clean seas whose beauty we can all enjoy.
<D>
Madam President, it is nice to see the Commissioner here in Parliament.
We look forward to seeing her in Scotland again soon and to continuing our very fruitful cooperation on this policy.
Before I make my brief points, I would echo Mr Guerreiro's points about support for the fisheries sector within cohesion policy.
We will be supporting his amendments, and I do think this sector is of particular strategic importance in our geography.
I would pick up on the rapporteur's call for better statistics, particularly for the targeting and monitoring of the efficiency of funding programmes.
It seems pretty clear, as things develop, that targeting at NUTS I, NUTS II or even NUTS III level is pretty broad and pretty scatter-gun.
I welcome moves in the future funding streams towards more thematic activity, be it the Lisbon Agenda, the promotion of a knowledge economy, the promotion of R&D, cross-border cooperation or, indeed, support for the fisheries sector under the Lisbon Agenda.
That is, I believe, the future for a really vibrant cohesion policy for the European Union, which is very much the jewel in the EU's crown.
It has brought the EU closer to our citizens and it has made us one Union where the Member States would keep us a series of different states.
We have a great potential to make this policy even more relevant and we look forward to hearing about the Green Paper in the Commissioner's speech.
<D>
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, I take it for granted that we are all entitled to speak for as long as we like.
I might need an extra minute or two, and I shall be happy to take it.
(SV) I will now switch to my own language.
The European political establishment's handling of the Treaty of Lisbon will go down to posterity as a disgrace in two respects: firstly, with regard to the political process for pushing it through and, secondly, with regard to the actual purpose of the treaty and its content.
If we look back to Laeken 2000, it was said there that we should produce a proposal for a constitutional solution.
This was to lead to us having a closer-knit Europe and citizens who were committed, as we were concerned that, in practice, citizens had a poor opinion of the EU.
The Convention, under the leadership of Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, produced something quite different.
The people of Europe did not want this, and the people of France and the Netherlands said 'no'.
Everyone knows that people in the United Kingdom, Denmark and many other countries would have voted 'no' if they had been given the chance.
Attempts were made to find a way round this - a new treaty appeared which is the same but, when it suits, is claimed not to be, and this claim continues to be adhered to.
It is now the case that, when the people of Ireland said 'no' to what we are now calling the Treaty of Lisbon, we have the gall the carry out an investigation into the reason why the people of Ireland voted incorrectly.
This is quite incredible, and there has been absolutely no debate about it.
You are all patting each other on the back and saying how good this is, despite the fact that you know it is a disgrace.
My second objection is this: a constitutional treaty, a constitution, does not exist to make it quicker to take political decisions.
Quite the opposite in fact - it exists to make it more difficult to take political decisions.
Constitutions are there to ensure that those who simply happen to be elected right now cannot make whatever decisions they want to.
It should be complicated.
This is what the American Constitution is like.
This is a French bureaucratic tradition to ensure that an authority can quickly take decisions on anything under the sun without needing to worry about public influence.
This is appalling and a disgrace to the EU.
<D>
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) We have been implementing the northern dimension policy since the beginning of this year on the basis of two documents adopted at the Northern Dimension Summit held in Helsinki in November 2006.
The policy framework document and the political statement adopted in Helsinki represent a turning point for the northern dimension, insofar as they turn the policy into a joint policy shared by all the northern dimension partners, that is, the EU, Russia, Norway and Iceland.
Joint acceptance of the new policy is a key objective and includes Russia's full participation in all northern dimension structures and activities.
The other main participants and actors in the northern dimension, in particular the four Northern Regional Councils and the international financial institutions, will also be involved in the process.
The northern dimension now represents a permanent platform for debating northern issues and concerns.
The Portuguese Presidency will certainly take work forward in this area.
A Steering Group meeting is planned for late September, early October in Reykjavík.
The Steering Group aims to provide continuity between the ministerial meetings and the Senior Officials' meetings.
A meeting of Senior Officials is scheduled during the Portuguese Presidency, to be held on 21 November in Russia.
As a Mediterranean country, Portugal would like to see a more intense and broader political debate with our partners from the southern shores of the Mediterranean within the context of Euromed.
The EU and Euromed countries share common interests and are facing similar challenges.
It is in our own interest to broaden EU cooperation with those countries, especially with regard to tackling migration flows and social development.
At the same time, we shall continue to work on implementing the new northern dimension policy.
As in the case of Euromed, a great deal could be achieved through practical cooperation based on good neighbourliness, a partnership of equality, joint responsibility and transparency.
<D>
(RO) The European Council we are preparing today is decisive for the future of Europe.
One of the most prosperous European countries and a representative of economic success by implementing the European integration procedures has said "no” to the Lisbon Treaty.
At the same time, 18 European countries have adopted this document, most of them being the same 18 that also said "yes” to the European Constitutional Treaty.
I am equally disappointed with the result of the referendum in Ireland, just like many of the previous speakers.
Nevertheless, the European Union has to carry on the reforms that are necessary for it.
A Europe with several levels of speed, for which there have been procedures even since the Amsterdam Treaty, and with well-defined exclusion options is the only way in which we can go forward at this moment.
The chance that Ireland had to evolve has to be provided to the countries that have recently joined the EU as well, such as Romania.
In times like these, we have to remember and regroup around the things that unite us and provide us with a reason to go forward.
In his famous speech in favour of the United States of Europe, Sir Winston Churchill said that, if Europe were once united in the sharing of its common inheritance, there would be no limit to the happiness, prosperity and glory which its people could enjoy.
I believe in this vision and, at the same time, I know that great efforts are required for its achievement.
Yet, this should not stop us from carrying on.
<D>
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of all the amendments proposed by my colleague from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, Mr Cercas, to defend social achievements in Europe, and the following three issues in particular, which I consider to be fundamental.
Limiting the working week to 48 hours is an imperative that we have defended tooth and nail, since it prevents Member States from imposing upon their workers working conditions that do not respect their fundamental social rights.
With regard to keeping on-call time as working time, the same applies to the health and safety of care workers, but also firefighters, other sectors subject to on-call time and all European citizens.
Promoting the reconciliation of professional life and private life is the last achievement, but not the least.
It enables our fellow citizens to achieve a balance that is essential for their well-being.
I promised, along with my colleagues in the PSE Group, to defend the social rights of my fellow citizens.
This is a resounding victory for European Socialists against the European Council's proposals, which were deemed unacceptable.
As my colleague Mr Cercas put it, we are giving them a chance to rectify a poor decision.
<D>
(FR) Are you going to be quiet up there?
When Mr Orbán claims in this House ...
(Noise in the Chamber)
Are you mobilising the extreme right?
You are right to do so.
When he claims in this House that we have said something against the Hungarian people, it is national populism; that is to say, it is wanting not to discuss the content of something but rather to set people against each other.
This is unworthy of the European Union, Mr Orbán.
You invited us to dine with you.
I have lost my appetite now; I will not dine with you.
What you have done is disgraceful!
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, this is the question on EIT private sector funding.
We believe that public and private partnerships are instrumental in driving information in the knowledge-based economy.
If not, we do not succeed.
The private sector provides not only additional financial resources but, more importantly, can bring about changes in the strategic direction of innovation.
So I would say it is not so much about money itself, but the way we cooperate, how we put together partners and interests.
Many EU countries have taken action to facilitate structural relations between the public and private sector with a view to promoting knowledge transfers between universities and industry.
In this context, the activities of the EIT and, notably, knowledge and innovation communities will be implemented through innovative public-private structure partnerships and financed through a variety of public-private sources.
The precise arrangements for their funding cannot be determined in advance and will clearly evolve over time, but the objective is to maximise the share of contributions from the private sector.
The Community contribution, which was agreed at EUR 308 million for the next Financial Perspective, is intended to act as a catalyst to draw forth resources from the private sector.
The Commission has been particularly attentive in seeking to facilitate and attract private sector participation in the financing of the EIT and knowledge innovation communities (KICs).
For example, a key criterion for the selection of the KICs will be their capacity to ensure long-term and sustainable financing, including a substantial contribution from the private sector.
It will be important for the governing board to identify fields for potential KICs that will attract the interest of a wide range of participants, including those in the private sector.
Moreover, the EIT will be empowered to establish an EIT foundation with the specific objective of mobilising and leveraging resources from both individual and corporate donors.
<D>
in writing. - In my capacity of EURONEST Vice-President, I voted in favour of the macro-financial assistance for Ukraine.
I hope it will be swiftly delivered in conformity with the conditions underlying the provision.
I welcome, in particular, the involvement of the European Parliament in this decision-making process as a consequence of the enactment of the Treaty of Lisbon provisions.
The macro-financial assistance for Ukraine is the first case to be decided under the new procedure.
Meanwhile, the delay registered in the decision-making process due to the new procedure is regrettable.
I urge the EU institutions to build upon the experience of granting Ukraine macro-financial assistance and avoid further delays.
Our Eastern Partners should be spared unnecessary delay.
I refer in particular to the case of the Republic of Moldova and its pro-European government, which is still waiting for the delivery of the EU macro-financial assistance.
While the Republic of Moldova is in urgent need of assistance, the proposal of the European Commission is already unacceptably late.
It will be submitted to the European Parliament only this week.
I call upon all EU institutions to avoid further delay in deciding on the macro-financial assistance for the Republic of Moldova.
<D>
in writing. - (FR) The Commission can never get it right on the subject of VAT.
In the 1980s the Cockfield Report called for a range of VAT rates.
In fact, there was only a minimum rate of 15%, 5% as the normal rate and the lower rate.
Then the European Commission wanted VAT at the rate applied by the country of origin.
In practice VAT was levied at the rate applied by the country of destination.
It was a provisional system that became a definitive system: the so-called 'Bolkenstein VAT' was not introduced.
There were now lower rates of VAT for French catering entities, CDs and activities generating a workforce.
The Commission gave in at least provisionally in its list in Annex H to the Sixth Directive in 1977, because it realised that Germans could hardly drive their Mercedes to a cross-border lunch at the low-VAT restaurant.
What a shame it did not realise in 1993 that with no border controls intra-Community VAT was an inexhaustible source of large-scale fraud.
The philosophical logic of VAT, an intelligent tax since it is economically neutral, is inaccessible to the vast majority of Commission officials.
That is why their legislation has failed constantly on this issue for the past 20 years.
<D>
One of the targets of the Europe 2020 strategy is to raise the employment rate among people aged 20-64 to 75%.
Another is to fight poverty, which is intended to improve the situation of 20 million people.
These effects are much to be desired and very ambitious.
Our objective is a modernised labour market with a highly specialised, precisely oriented and very efficient workforce.
However, I think this will be difficult to achieve.
At present, 15% of young people do not complete a full secondary education.
Over 30% complete tertiary education but, in spite of this, do not find work because the qualifications they have gained do not meet the needs of the market.
The lifelong learning programme does not take account of the particular situation of people who do not possess a university education.
If, however, we are talking about the phenomenon of poverty, the same social groups are most at risk from it: the unemployed, the poorly educated and the elderly.
Such high unemployment is undoubtedly an effect of the crisis, which has caused, among other things, a drop in industrial production to the level of 20 years ago.
I support the Commission in its consistent efforts towards making the EU economy competitive in relation to the United States and Japan, but I suggest a more realistic approach in the exceptionally difficult financial situation.
<D>
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Madam President, Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the solemn proclamation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights on 12 December in Strasbourg by the Presidents of the Council, Portuguese Prime Minister José Sócrates, the European Parliament and the European Commission will undoubtedly be one of the most significant moments in the recent history of the Union and the Portuguese Presidency of the European Union.
We will be taking a step forward that will have important and concrete implications for the consolidation of the universal values of human dignity, freedom, equality and solidarity.
Thanks to the new Lisbon Treaty, the Charter will have the same value as the Treaties; in other words it will be legally binding.
This fact, given its importance, must be duly underlined and is something of which this Parliament, the national governments and the Commission should all be proud.
It marks the end of a long road.
The impact of the decision to give the Charter of Fundamental Rights legal value goes beyond the usual political and diplomatic circles as it directly affects the legal affairs of our citizens.
It is a concrete result of Europe.
Clearly, the institutional reforms of the Lisbon Treaty are important and it is also true that the changes made to EU policies, to the common foreign and security policy, to the justice and home affairs policy and in other areas are vital so that the Union can tackle the future and meet the challenges facing us.
However, the existence of a catalogue of rights, which is binding on the European institutions and on the Member States when they apply European law, has a meaning far beyond all this.
From now on we are putting our citizens at the centre of the European project.
As we are talking about fundamental rights, I also want, on behalf of the Presidency and also on behalf of my own country, to express my delight at the Protocol of the Lisbon Treaty which provides for the accession of the Union to the European Convention on Human Rights.
That is because this Protocol represents the achievement of a long-held ambition.
With regard to all of this, I must congratulate this Parliament and Mr Leinen on the adoption of this draft report on 12 November by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs.
This has once again shown the commitment of this House to the Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
It only remains for me to express my sincere desire that the House will also find itself able to vote in favour of this report, thus allowing the Charter of Fundamental Rights to be solemnly proclaimed by the three institutions on 12 December.
(Applause)
<D>
If we look at the European Union as a living organism, the European car industry is its backbone.
It accounts for 3% of the EU's GDP and generates a commercial surplus of EUR 35 billion.
However, 2008 was a difficult year for this industry, where during the first half of the year, car sales dropped due to a rise in the price of fuel, while during the second half, sales fell by 19.3% as a result of the financial crisis.
These are not the only problems which this sector is facing.
Between 2009 and 2015 the car sector must implement new standards for polluting emissions, fuel economy and so on, while all of this is adding billions of euros to the industry's costs.
The figures given above are also relevant because the car industry provides for the incomes of more than 12 million families.
One job in a car company is linked to another four jobs at suppliers and another five in related sectors and sales.
It is therefore clear that the health of this sector of the European economy is vital to the EU economy as a whole.
In these circumstances, rapid, coordinated intervention by European governments and institutions is an absolute must, such as introducing programmes for returning old cars against a consistent reduction in the purchase price of a new one, financial assistance and so on.
<D>
in writing. - The fishing industry has faced many crises over the years, but none greater than at present, with rising fuel prices which are pushing the industry over the edge to the point where it can no longer survive.
The continuing spiralling price of oil could prove to be disastrous for many industries, but none is more vulnerable than the fishing industry, with jobs at sea and on shore at risk.
We must look into all the options which are available to us.
One route that should be explored is reducing taxes in order to ensure that fuel costs come down.
May I ask the following question: if we do not have fishermen, where will the fish we require come from?
Are we going to sit back and allow foreign imports to take over our markets and put our industry out of business?
Saving our fishing fleets and the industry in general will prove to be a massive challenge.
However, I am confident that with good will and all-round cooperation it is possible.
I welcome yesterday's statement from the Commission announcing its intention to provide emergency assistance to fishing fleets.
I sincerely hope that these measures will be formally adopted by the Council of Fisheries Ministers next week and then swiftly implemented.
<D>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council Presidency has mentioned the figure of a million published documents.
When it comes to access to documents, there must be quality as well as quantity, but it is not just about quality.
If we are going to be honest, there is a problem with the type of documents: meeting documents or documents that accompany the decision-making process.
It is this that is missing today.
I will give you an example: Coreper I documents, which are so difficult to find, or documents on foreign policy, which are treated like diplomatic documents, and so are not in the registers.
These are all documents that are vital for learning about the decision-making process.
I have only given you one example in the short time available to me.
In view of the answers that we have been given, I believe that this should also be seen more as an opportunity than a risk for the functioning of the European institutions.
<D>
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, the draft regulation on population and housing censuses is a document of considerable importance.
Data gleaned from population and housing censuses provide an opportunity for rational drafting of development strategies and for intervention action to be taken.
This is why it is so important for the data to be transparent and comparable.
In that case, Community solutions will apply to real and well-studied phenomena.
Comparability is not just a matter of well-defined data; it also means that such data have been collected over identical periods of time.
Clear specification of collection periods and updating, correction and publication dates is of great significance and this has been clearly stated in the document and amendments.
One important question is the way in which data on local communities are gathered.
I support the amendment introducing a separate definition for this.
I also support the amendment introducing environmental policies alongside regional ones.
Regular statistical studies looking at family, social, economic and residential characteristics are undoubtedly needed in view of the demographic and social problems Europe faces.
This is why I think that the amendment deleting recommended topics for geographical levels, and in particular not derived topics such as location of schools and higher education institutions, means of getting to work or school, distance from work or school, number of children born alive, type of economic activity, duration of unemployment, main source of livelihood, income, housing conditions or disability, which describe families' actual living conditions, is wrong.
The emphasis on respect for national personal data protection rights in the text is important, and the principle of subsidiarity has rightly been retained in this area.
I congratulate Mrs Juknevičienon a thorough piece of work on the draft report.
<D>
The next item is Question Time (B6-0484/2008).
The following questions have been submitted to the Commission.
Part I
Subject: Information for citizens on EU measures to protect them from the international financial crisis
In reply to my oral question on the impact of the international credit crisis during the plenary sitting of the European Parliament held last March, the Commission stated that we should expect a fall of 0.5% in the EU's growth rate, an increase in inflation and an external trade deficit of EUR 185 000 million in the EU of 27.
The Commission stressed that the best way of dealing with this international crisis was to continue with structural reforms and macroeconomic policies, pointing out that protectionism is not a solution.
Currently, we are witnessing the further spread of the financial crisis, which is now also affecting the big conglomerates.
Have the data which the Commission previously provided changed?
How will it inform European citizens of the implications of this crisis and what practical measures will it take to protect them?
<D>
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I share the assessment of the rapporteur, Mr Saryusz-Wolski, concerning the problems of dependence on imports and the growing dependence on imports of energy fuels and I have little disagreement with it - the report describes it very well.
I do not, however, agree with the solutions this report puts forward and am of the opinion that important strategic objectives of internal, intra-European energy policy should have been reflected in this report.
In my opinion, the most important instrument for reducing this growing dependence on imports is the reduction of energy consumption in all areas and I am also of the opinion that the 20% increase in energy efficiency which Europe has undertaken to achieve by the year 2020 has to be a target that must leave its mark on strategic foreign energy policy.
When we realise that in the construction sector in Russia alone, as much gas is consumed unnecessarily as is otherwise exported from Russia to the European Union, then it is clear how much we can gain if we implement our efficiency strategies at home and then also turn the outward-looking energy strategy of the European Union into a viable method for Russia.
This would therefore also involve influencing Russia's internal energy policy by example.
On the subject of oil - dependence on OPEC is always a disadvantage in the light of the heated debate about Russia - I would say: if Europe manages to make economical, efficient cars on a pilot model and implement an aviation fuel tax for aviation gasoline, then we would gain more than with heated debates with OPEC on markets and export opportunities.
We support some parts, Mr Saryusz-Wolski, but not other parts!
<D>
on behalf of the UEN group. - (PL) Mr President, both of the reports presented today are based on making assessments we have been forced to make by the decisions of various bodies of the European Union.
Evaluating the tools of Activity Based Management, Activity Based Budgeting or 'Strategic Planning and Programming' may be necessary, but give the impression of creating 'art for art's sake'.
How can achieving political objectives be compared with building a power station or transport networks?
Is the European Union a business undertaking to which we are attempting to apply similar mechanisms of assessing efficiency?
The same applies to the mid-term review of the multiannual financial framework.
Every day we are carrying out evaluations and diverting resources from our annual budgets.
These decisions are made by the European Council, which increases the funding available for implementing important individual tasks.
Stable multiannual financial frameworks give us all a multiannual sense of safety, and that is what we should appreciate the most, particularly in the difficult times at present.
I cordially congratulate Mr Böge and Mr Virrankoski on their very good reports.
Mrs Grybauskaitė, I wish you the greatest success in the coming elections.
<D>
Mr President, I am less diplomatic than most of my colleagues in this House.
The fact is that lies, damn lies and statistics defeated the truth in the Irish referendum.
Lisbon is not dead.
Nevertheless, the choice made in Ireland is a sovereign decision of the Irish people.
The only people who can vary that decision on that Treaty are the Irish people.
Whether that happens or not depends on the discussions that will begin tomorrow between the Irish Government and the other 26 heads of state.
There is no magic wand.
It will take time to reach conclusions.
I propose a new deadline for ratification of Lisbon.
I think that setting it before the European elections is a reasonable target.
If the Irish people continue to be dissatisfied with Lisbon in whatever form it is finally agreed between us and the rest of Europe, then Ireland will have no option but to renegotiate its relationship with the Union.
That would be a disastrous course for our country.
Europe has very little to lose if it loses Ireland, but Ireland has everything to lose if it loses Europe.
The global challenges we all face in this constantly changing and inter-connected world are clear: climate change, demographic change, migration and energy crisis, hunger and poverty killing millions, human insecurity, international crime, topped by an identity crisis in virtually every one of our Member States.
These cannot be solved by any Member State pulling the shutters down and hoping these will go away.
To conclude, could I urge that Europe demonstrate tangible capacity to deliver decent living and working conditions?
That will reinforce our unity and our solidarity and produce a positive solution to this crisis.
(Applause)
<D>
in writing. - I would like to remind the Council and also the Commission that the EU is based on the basic values, such as democracy, rule of law and respect for human rights.
Therefore I condemn strongly the spirit in which the recent EU-Russia summit in Nice was held.
It is not acceptable that business as usual will start again with the argument that there is no alternative.
Mainstreaming human rights in its external policies and respect for the rule of law are the cornerstones in any relations with third countries.
Russia cannot be an exception, in particular in the light of the fact that it has not fulfilled all the conditions laid down in the agreement after the aggression towards Georgia.
I am concerned that the EU will lose respect as a serious and independent actor in international affairs.
Furthermore, EU hesitancy to set clear limits on such a pre-planned violation of the norms of international conduct is likely to encourage similar aggression from the Russian side in the future.
Therefore I strongly call on the Commission and Council to seriously reconsider their decision to continue with business as usual.
<D>
The creation of the European External Action Service is an absolute must in order to improve the effectiveness of the EU's external action.
The purpose of this is to promote a much more consistent foreign policy and raise the EU's profile at an international level.
However, achieving these objectives depends on how we organise this service.
The report contains a number of particularly important proposals.
We need an organisation which is as streamlined as possible and avoids any duplication.
This is why I support the merger of Commission delegations in third countries, of the Council's liaison offices and the offices of the EU Special Representatives, as well as the creation of 'EU embassies'.
From an efficiency perspective, I also find it an interesting proposal that these delegations will adopt certain consular functions, such as dealing with Schengen visas.
I wish to stress the need for standard training for staff so that we can really have a professional service which meets the EU's needs.
Setting up a European diplomatic college seems an ideal solution to me for providing diplomatic staff with training based on common standards in order to guarantee consistency for the EEAS.
Indeed, in the future, a European diplomatic career could become just as attractive as a diplomatic career for a Member State.
<D>
- (PL) Mr President, in his document, our colleague Mr Millán Mon, and also the Commissioner and the Minister, have presented possible solutions, strategies and objectives which should guide us in our cooperation with America.
I would like to come back to another thought and share it with you.
I think that Barack Obama's election slogan - 'The change we need' - concerns us, Europeans, as well.
I am thinking about a change in our attitude towards the USA.
On one hand we admire the wealth, economy, science, film, music and freedom of what is historically a young society.
On the other hand, there is dislike, and even hostility, especially from many Left-wing Members, to American policy, to American religiousness, and to American capitalism.
Paradoxically, Russia is a constant friend, no matter what it does, including the worst attacks, as for example the killing of journalists, and America is a partner dressed in the clothes of an enemy, an enemy which, it is true, did help to liberate Europe from the Nazis, and which was not obliged to make such sacrifices, but did so of its own will.
It is perceived as an enemy which helped to rebuild Europe, but in spite of this it has not earned the title of permanent coalition partner.
I am, therefore, talking about appropriate standards and judgments, based on common sense, and not on the only correct and fair ideology, as if it were an echo rebounding from Moscow.
Whatever is bad or faulty about the USA must be assessed accordingly, but whatever is good and could help us to realise the objectives of the EU should be appreciated.
Cooperation must be based on realities, and at the same time on a stable will to solve problems together.
The many statements, the applause, the amendments and entire resolutions proposed by the Left in the last four years and which I have had the opportunity to witness, were often underpinned by a negative, generalised attitude, not necessarily backed up by facts.
Allow me one last sentence, Mr President - Barack Obama only became President by the will of the nation, a nation which is worth working with, a nation which protects values that are also important to us.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, Mr Füle, Mr Lajčák, ladies and gentlemen, the issue that we are discussing did not begin on 21 January.
Therefore, we need to ask ourselves and I am also asking you: Why did the Commission and the other international bodies not put out the fire when the flames first appeared in mid 2009?
The 2009 elections were the best that have so far taken place in Albania and they were based on election legislation which, amazingly, was adopted following a consensus between the socialists and democrats.
Reaching a consensus is something entirely new in Albania.
I believe that this is important.
All the socialist election boards, the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR), the election observers and we ourselves believed that the elections were managed correctly.
The government which was subsequently formed was also something new for Albania.
Two parties which cannot stand each other sat down and worked together.
The democratic party, on the one hand, and the smaller social democratic party, on the other.
Two opposing groups have come together to help Albania to make progress.
It has joined NATO and it has a visa regime, but unfortunately, it has not yet been granted candidate status.
However, just at the moment when the government was formed, the opposition decided that the elections had not been properly conducted and called for the ballot boxes to be opened.
What sort of government opens ballot boxes?
Not the sort that we have in my country or in yours.
We have to go before the constitutional court or the election commission.
Protests like the ones which we have seen, the hunger strikes, and the refusal to cooperate in Parliament to pass important legislation, are all simply unacceptable.
It is important that we make this clear and that we face the facts.
It is not always possible to bring everything onto the same level.
I would like to find out what the most important and the most difficult issues are.
The accusations that have been made both recently and right from the beginning concerned the issue of opening the ballot boxes.
This is not possible, because the constitution does not allow it.
How can negotiations take place about this if it is not allowed?
Now the situation has escalated and four people have been killed.
It is good that you have attempted today to present a road map.
However, it may be exaggerating slightly to describe it in that way.
I would very much like Mr Lajčák and you, Mr Füle, to use this road map to draw up a route towards a better future for the people of the country.
<D>
Mr President, I rise on this report because I absolutely despise the Common Fisheries Policy and the ecological disaster that it has caused for my country and the waters around it.
There are many good things in this report because it aims to cut down on the amount of fish that are disposed of, that are caught and not needed, or for which fishermen do not have the appropriate quota.
But this does not sort out the root of the problem, in that this is a policy that deserves to be consigned to the rubbish bin.
It does not conserve fish, it does not help fishermen, and in fact many fishermen in my country think it would be best to get rid of it.
There are plenty of examples around the world where fisheries policy aids conservation and keeps fishermen in jobs and doing what they want to do.
Iceland has transferable quotas that become the property of the fishermen and their families and which can be transferred throughout generations.
We are not being wise enough or clever enough in this policy, and we should just get rid of it.
<D>
(PL) Mr President, I welcomed with interest the Commission's Green Paper on the Review of the Consumer Acquis.
Simplification and improvement of the regulatory environment merits particular interest in terms of how it affects both consumers and enterprises.
This is especially true regarding the latter, because 90% of them are SMEs, which are the driving force behind many fast-developing economies.
It is also important to link the problems concerning consumer contracts with work on contract law in its entirety within the context of the ongoing process aimed at developing common frameworks for European contract law.
I also support the view that harmonisation should lead to a comparable level of consumer protection across all the Member States, without full harmonisation of all national provisions.
Embarking upon the latter could mean having to wait significantly longer before the desired effects in the area made themselves felt.
I would like to thank the rapporteur very much for a precise and detailed approach to the subject in her report.
It has facilitated understanding of many key problems and clarified a number of concerns.
<D>
Madam President, despite the fact that the proposed legislation that we are discussing is about the trade in seal products, the discussions have tended instead to revolve around seal hunting and then primarily outside the EU.
The slaughter of seals in the way that we have seen pictures of from countries outside the EU is terrible and should not be allowed to occur.
However, we should make a distinction between hunting and slaughter.
Seal hunting occurs in Sweden, but it is controlled protective hunting.
No clubs or cudgels are used; guns are used instead.
The whole process is surrounded by strict rules and it would be a very poor way of managing natural resources if the animal were not permitted to be used once it had been shot.
The compromise that has now been proposed is better than the original motion.
However, I have some concerns regarding how some parts of the legislation may be interpreted and that it would have negative consequences for Sweden and our Nordic neighbours.
Let us hope that I am wrong.
<D>
(LV) Prime Minister, both you and we expect a lot of Europe's future.
In his time Robert Schuman hoped to unite Europeans after centuries of separation caused by various conflicts.
He understood that in order to know where we are going it is important to know where we have come from.
Prime Minister, do you realise that the European Union has not taken stock of its undemocratic, totalitarian past?
An obvious example is last year's EU Framework Decision on combating racism and xenophobia.
It is recommended that European countries impose custodial sentences for the denial of Nazi crimes, but similar crimes under the Communist regime, their unjustified denial or, even worse, their glorification are deliberately forgotten.
Europe should not allow this.
What impression does this give to the millions of Eastern Europeans, including residents of what is now the European Union, who were tortured in Stalin's concentration camps?
I call upon you to seriously reflect on and promote a solution to this problem in the name of Europe's future and justice.
Thank you.
<D>
(SK) Rising food prices are caused by the present volatility of the agricultural markets, which are naturally unstable in any case.
The main task of the agricultural policies has therefore always been, and still is, to eliminate this instability.
We should remember the biblical story of the seven fat cows and seven thin cows: thousands of years ago society was already capable of organising agricultural markets and thereby preventing fluctuations of these markets and giving Egypt the conditions for prosperity, while other societies suffered famine and wars because of the lack of food.
Over the course of its history, mankind has to a large extent developed in line with each society's ability to accept the priority of agricultural policies.
However, the current struggles we are witnessing in the WTO, focusing on military and control policies or on national commercial and economic interests, unfortunately confirm that the today's agricultural policies have entirely different priorities.
Ensuring the stability of the agricultural markets must therefore become a priority for the WTO if any national policies, including our common agricultural policy, are to make sense.
Otherwise, ladies and gentlemen, we are flogging a dead horse and will continue doing so until a global food crisis makes us adopt radical measures, which will of course be to the detriment of farmers and the public but to the benefit of speculators.
Therefore, the most important thing is to have enough courage to grab the bull by its horns.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, let me thank you all for your very interesting recommendations and your input.
With the very limited time I have available I will not be able reply to all of them, but let me comment on some of the issues.
First of all, the time constraints.
A Member noted that we have time constraints, but let me point out that the first proposal - the general animal health law - that will come into force is scheduled for 2010, not 2013 as was mentioned.
Another point that was made by several speakers was welfare during transport.
As I have committed myself already, we are conducting an impact assessment which hopefully will be ready in a couple of months and then, depending on the outcome of the impact assessment, we shall decide how to proceed regarding welfare of animals during transport.
Now let me turn to budgets.
Following the recommendation of the European Parliament, the Commission is expected to prepare a detailed budget on the expenditure involved in different programmes of actions.
This cannot be done in the frame of this action plan as it must follow the relevant budgetary procures.
The intention is to reflect on proposals during the 2009 budget mid-term review and the Commission will explore the possibility of widening the current veterinary fund and making use of other related funds to finance actions that will have a positive impact on animal health.
Vaccination is extensively carried out and financed by the Union in many Member States at present, both for bluetongue and for rabies, but I must make it clear regarding foot-and-mouth disease, Mr Matsakis, that we are not in favour of preventive vaccination, though in emergency cases we will of course vaccinate.
Finally, in answer to Mrs Doyle I would say that the problem of minor use for minor species is taken into account in the Animal Health Action Plan through the Technology Platform project, which comes under the Seventh Research Framework Programme.
I really heard a lot of interesting comments from all of you and we will have the opportunity to discuss these points more extensively in the near future.
Thank you very much for your support.
<D>
rapporteur. - (NL) Madam President, I would like to express my sincere thanks to my fellow Members for their input into the debate and for the support I have received for various points in my report.
There were some critical comments too, of course.
That, too, I am happy with, as it can only be good for the debate.
Our aim is to guarantee to consumers that food produced on the back of new technologies or new food coming onto the market is safe.
Through our input and our proposals, we will succeed in achieving this aim.
This will also provide certainty for those producers looking to innovate, in that they will now know what is allowed and what is not.
The report also covers data protection in relation to those producers, something that also promotes innovation in the field of food safety.
I would, in addition, like to offer my heartfelt thanks to the Commissioner for what she said about nanotechnology.
In this field it is true that there is still much change to come, and if we lay down a definition now, at the beginning, it must be possible to revise it as the science moves on.
I would also like to thank the Commissioner for what she said about animal cloning.
I would, however, like to point out to you that Parliament has already adopted a resolution in which we make clear that we do not want meat from cloned animals on the market as a foodstuff.
This point, too, comes up again in this report, and I would urge that the cloning of animals be excluded from the regulation on novel foods.
The report calls for that to happen and, as you have just heard, this House is strongly behind the idea.
Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to offer my sincere thanks to my staff, Thomas, Vivian and Jan-Jaap, who worked very hard alongside us in order to produce this report.
<D>
rapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to begin my speech by expressing my thanks to the Commission for its 2008 report on equality between men and women, which takes a comprehensive approach both to policies to mainstream the gender dimension and towards specific positive discrimination measures.
Although, admittedly, we should point out that the Commission's report has work matters at its core, it takes no account of many other issues and difficult situations which women encounter and we have therefore tried to incorporate them into this Parliament report.
I also wish to thank all my colleagues who have by their efforts helped improve the report as initially presented.
There is common agreement that despite the progress that has been made, there is still much to be done.
In that regard complacency is likely to be our worst enemy.
If we are unaware of the challenges and the work which is yet to be done it will be difficult for us to make headway on equality issues.
The outlook of this report is based on the principle of gender mainstreaming, and the report raises various matters which have a bearing on that principle.
They are all important and we can not ignore any of them: incorporating women into the labour market, domestic violence, women in education, balancing family life with work, and vulnerable groups such as immigrant women or the disabled.
All these aspects must be borne in mind and merit exhaustive study and analysis, but I would like in the time available to me to focus on the aspects which I regard as most important.
Domestic violence is the greatest social scourge of our time, not only in Europe but worldwide.
A social injustice in which women, purely because they are women, experience violence at the hands of men because chauvinistic values are still fairly deep-rooted in our society.
Accordingly it is necessary to encourage laws in Member Status to combat this social plague.
We have a very good example in Spain, where a few years ago the Law against Domestic Violence was incorporated into the national legal order; it recognises the rights of mistreated women and implements a comprehensive policy ranging from prevention, to treatment and reintegration of the women affected.
As far as women and the labour market are concerned, we should be aware that we are a long way still from achieving the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy.
Women's employment has risen but unemployment figures for women are still much higher than those for men, and we must therefore take political measures, both through the European Commission and the Member States, which encourage women to join the labour market on the same terms as men.
Another fact of life which we cannot skate over is the difference in wages; this has stood at 15% since 2003.
Greater measures which have the agreement of business and the unions are needed.
Also in this report we propose that the Community institutions and the Member States should declare 22 February as International Equal Pay Day.
A woman would need to work 52 more days a year to earn the same wage as a man.
On finding a work/life balance, we must change the fact that currently 85% of informal carers are women.
We need more public services whose role is to provide childcare and care for dependants.
Similarly, as regards participation by women in public life, we should encourage initiatives to increase participation through social organisations, unions and political parties.
Electoral quotas were a decisive step which must continue as we strive for equality in democracy.
There are other key aspects such as access to education, the overturning of social stereotypes, the issues and difficulties facing women in rural communities, which we cannot ignore.
We must join forces to that end.
We must work closely with organisations and make the fundamental European Union principle of equality between men and women a reality, because by so doing we will be moving towards a Europe with more law and greater social justice.
<D>
Madam President, allow me to make three further comments.
Firstly, I would like to say to Mrs Beer that I am not afraid of my own group and would be fully up for this debate.
One of the most dreadful amendments to my report in committee came from my group: it stated that there had been no positive changes in Afghanistan.
The arrogance of this really incenses me.
I believe that we all need to take a very realistic and discriminating attitude towards Afghanistan.
That country has a society that is not only rich but also contradictory and multifaceted, and the problems facing us are even more so.
Secondly, many colleagues and fellow Members have said to me that we need to shoulder our responsibilities towards Afghanistan when it comes to dealing with terrorism, opium growing, corruption and so on.
Many of my left-wing colleagues would possibly say that this applies to the occupation too.
My own personal viewpoint, which I have tried to make clear, has to do with the interests of a people who have lived through 30 years of war.
I think that much of this is in the report and for this I would again thank all those persons and all those groups involved.
Thirdly, while I disagree with important parts of the text I am happy to continue to work on the report as part of my ongoing commitment to Afghanistan.
There is no question of that.
<D>
Temporary employment agencies employ some three million people in the European Union.
They are estimated to provide services valued at EUR 75 billion.
The draft directive on conditions for temporary agency workers aims to provide a minimum level of protection for temporary workers while, at the same time, supporting the temporary employment industry.
It has become an example of social legislation at a time of widespread anticipation of a social Europe.
The main basis of this legislative act is non-discrimination against agency workers in terms of payment, social and employee rights and applicable legislation.
There will also be no discrimination as regards working time, overtime, holidays and protection for pregnant women.
One very important aspect of the directive is that temporary agency workers are now covered right from day one.
Any derogations from this principle must always be discussed with the social partners.
There is no doubt that there are at present huge differences in working conditions and payment for temporary workers.
These differences must be ironed out as quickly as possible.
On the grounds stated above, in the voting I have opted for the adoption of the regulations to protect such workers as soon as possible.
<D>
(PL) Mr President, East Timor is widely considered to be the most successful example of a transformation process in the history of the United Nations.
East Timor does, however, seem to have forgotten the sacrifices it made during its war of independence to put an end to its brutal occupation by Indonesia lasting 24 years, and the joy with which it celebrated its own independence.
Less than six years after regaining its independence, however, East Timor now stands on the brink of chaos.
The transition to democracy and independence is never easy.
It is not the end of the journey but only the beginning.
One thing is absolutely certain, however, namely that violence never can be and never has been the way to deal with problems.
That must be made quite clear.
The way to resolve problems is through dialogue, political pluralism, strengthening democratic institutions such as the parliament, an independent judicial system and governments working under democratically elected leaders.
I call on the Council and the European Commission to ensure that as much as possible of the assistance allocated to East Timor under the 10th European Development Fund is devoted to strengthening democracy.
<D>
(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, we have already tolerated a highly alarming and unacceptable situation for 13 years.
The Commission and the Member States manage taxpayers' money badly and illegally.
The European Court of Auditors' Report clearly shows that the Commission and the Member States proceed negligently and are not thoroughly familiar with the rules of budgetary expenditure.
Now there are also suspicions of attempts to misuse money from the Union's budget.
Completely contrary to Commission regulations and the laws of individual states, public tender procedures are not carried out, claims are made for payment of ineligible expenditure, recipients are unable to support the legitimacy of overheads or staff costs, while controls are also faltering.
Ladies and gentlemen, if the citizens whose money we are so shamelessly squandering managed their own firms and households like this, the European Union would be full of socially excluded, homeless people.
Now I am asking the Commission and the Council to pull themselves together and start to regard taxpayers' money as if it were their own.
This is the only way we can strengthen trust in the European integration process.
<D>
Public health and its commercialisation are being targeted by the EU.
The aim is to multiply capitalist profit by downgrading public structures, which are being limited to high-cost sectors unprofitable for private operators.
The EU is treating health as a means of increasing workers' productivity and reducing social costs.
It is intervening in a sector that is exclusively under the authority of the Member States, applying private enterprise criteria, promoting entrepreneurial activity and neglecting the basic human right to health and life.
At the same time, the EU is using health as a pretext to promote its expansionist, imperialist plans by proposing the involvement of health services in the CFSP, international trade and relations with third countries.
The Community framework for health services and management of innovation in health systems, and the creation of European centres of excellence and other proposed measures, are the just the first step towards concentrating health services in the hands of a few multinationals.
These will do business with private insurance companies to decide on the services provided on the basis of an unacceptable system of class discrimination.
We are voting against the report because we align ourselves with the workers' struggle against the commercialisation and privatisation of health.
We support the fight for a free public health system with high-quality services that fully cover the needs of ordinary families.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me briefly explain why my group is about to reject the compromise resolution in the vote.
In the negotiations, it proved impossible to formulate a critical position on the nuclear deal between the US and India.
We regard this as a failure by the European Parliament, as we expect this House to have the courage to criticise Europe's silence during the negotiations in the Nuclear Suppliers Group.
It is sheer cowardice for all the Member States, and especially the German Chair Country of the NSG, to prove incapable of defending the European Security Strategy in a meeting of such importance.
We have a compromise in which one of the priorities is combating proliferation.
However, by remaining silent, we have forfeited - indeed, wrecked - the credibility of disarmament policy.
Nuclear disarmament?
No chance!
Strengthening the NPT regime?
No chance!
Credibility in negotiations with Iran?
No chance!
Instead, we have France's economic interests, especially in closing a deal on nuclear technology with India.
That is the inherent position, which is why we are rejecting the compromise.
<D>
in writing. - (ET) Social inclusion and child poverty are things we should take seriously and in that respect the committee's initiative is welcome.
We should nonetheless question whether our plans are ambitious enough.
The Member States should take several important steps in this regard.
The thing we need most in order to reduce social exclusion is for people to have incomes which are enough to live on.
We should acknowledge that in most of the EU States where it is established, the minimum wage does not provide for the normal income.
Falling social assistance clearly has a role in social exclusion.
Given the current economic depression there is open talk in Estonia, where there have been lively debates on how to balance the budget, of compromises on child benefit.
Universal child benefit is something which all children deserve and as such, in addition to being of practical assistance, is of great symbolic significance.
As a former Minister for Population and the current President of the Estonian Child Protection League, I am au fait with these matters and I shall do everything to ensure that this support, although costly and inefficient, is not abolished.
In addition to income support there are important targeted benefits to vulnerable groups such as the elderly, single parents, households with many children, and the disabled.
Benefits of this kind should cover extra costs in connection with personal support, and medical and social care.
The benefits in place in the United Kingdom for the elderly during cold weather to enable them to keep their homes warm and combat energy poverty are an excellent example of what other Member States, including Estonia, should take as a model.
<D>
President-in-Office of the Council. - (CS) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Czech Presidency, I would like to inform you about the Council's position regarding the completion of negotiations on the revision of the Working Time Directive.
As you are undoubtedly aware, the Council spent four long years discussing an amendment to this directive before finally reaching a common position on the content - after some highly complex negotiations.
A qualified majority of Member States have agreed that the key disputed issue of the opt-out will be left in the directive, but with strongly defined conditions which will tighten up its application considerably.
The Council, for example, wanted to reduce the maximum weekly working time when using the opt-out from 78 hours to 60 or 65 hours and proposed banning the use of opt-outs when signing an employment contract or limiting the period of consent given by employees to work in an opt-out regime to one year.
The Council's aim was to restrict the use of opt-out in the Member States, but primarily to enhance the protection of employees who are using the opt-out.
The Council viewed its draft directive as a well-balanced document promoting employee protection, and hoped it would also prove acceptable to Parliament, which was expected to approve it at the second reading.
Since the vote last December, the Czech Presidency has been well aware of the different attitudes of the two institutions towards the draft directive, but has not regarded the negotiating procedure as a fight for prestige between the two institutions.
Instead, it has taken a pragmatic, non-ideological and realistic approach, taking account of the realities of the European labour market.
It is an indisputable fact that the opt-out is used today by 15 of the 27 EU Member States.
Since January this year, when the Czech Republic took over the Presidency, we have pursued very intense negotiations at all levels in an effort to find space for a possible compromise with Parliament.
The first meeting of the Member States on this topic was held in Prague on 13 January.
At least eight rounds of informal trialogues have been held to date, as well as three rounds of the negotiating process proper.
At this point I would like to thank the Commission, and especially Commissioner Špidla, for its specialist assistance and constructive approach in searching for a possible compromise over the wording of the directive.
The Council was willing to agree and to compromise on the common position, but despite this no agreement has been reached.
Over the past four months, the Czech Presidency has been very active and responsible in holding talks with Parliament and submitting many compromise solutions to Parliament on various issues regarding the directive in a bid to find a final solution acceptable to the Council and to Parliament.
Today I can state that the Council made a number of concessions to meet the demands of Parliament, and yet these were not enough for Parliament.
For example, the Council was prepared to abandon the common position and to endorse Parliament's view that all on-call time is indeed work time.
The Council also made concessions during the debate on harmonising work and family life in the deadline for providing supplementary daytime rest and in the definition of top-ranking employees, and I could list further examples.
The Council wanted to come to an agreement with Parliament over the key issue of the opt-out and was prepared to accommodate Parliament's demands and to accept its other proposals, for example a ban on arranging opt-outs during the probationary period and removal of the maximum weekly working time for the opt-out, even though we naturally felt that we were acting against the interests of employees.
We were even prepared to accept the idea of introducing registration of hours actually worked in the opt-out.
However, Parliament did not even go half way to meet the Council's position.
Speaking on behalf of the Czech Presidency, I am frankly sorry that Parliament was unwilling to compromise and to agree on a revised directive, which has been awaited not only by Member States but also by EU citizens for five long years.
Agreement on a revised directive would contribute to greater protection for employees, would help in solving the problem of on-call time and rest, and would pave the way towards a gradual reduction in the use of opt-outs in the Member States.
However, the MEPs in the negotiating committee were deaf to these proposals.
They refused to accept them and they refused to accept the Council's counter proposals and the compromises offered by the Commission, insisting instead on their own ideological position.
Since Parliament was unwilling to respect the situation in the Council and the realities of the current situation, the existing directive will remain in force.
Use of the opt-out will not be restricted, no monitoring will be introduced, and workers will have to continue working up to 78 hours a week.
In all probability, the attitude of Parliament will lead to greater use of the opt-out.
The European Commission has received signals today from another two Member States that are intending to introduce the opt-out, and consequently any hopes for its future abolition are further reduced.
The Council wanted to prevent this but Parliament has ruled otherwise.
<D>
(RO) Let me begin by expressing the hope that, in spite of the fairly general nature of the programme, the Spanish Presidency will achieve concrete results by the end of June.
I welcome the fact that the Presidency is concerned with developing the European Research Area and ensuring mobility for researchers.
However, at a time when there are labour market restrictions, this task is going to be difficult to achieve.
I hope that the informal meeting of employment ministers at the end of this month will end with specific results in this area.
The programme also includes the review of the TEN-T action guidelines.
It would be desirable for the review also to take into account the Danube Strategy which, although not mentioned directly in the Presidency's programme, is a European Commission commitment for 2010.
In the energy sector, it would be desirable to improve the European Action Plan for Energy Efficiency and adopt the 2010-2014 Action Plan for Energy.
With regard to the former, I believe that its revision should also include a proposal on financial resources, especially with a view to making buildings energy efficient.
The European Economic Recovery Plan has included the European Union's involvement in funding the Nabucco gas pipeline.
It is in the European Union's interest for this funding to continue in the 2010-2014 Action Plan for Energy as well.
As far as the Eastern Partnership is concerned, it is worth stating that the European Union's relations with Ukraine are extremely important.
I would also take this opportunity to ask you not to forget the Southern Caucasus region, which is an important alternative energy resource for the European Union, or the Republic of Moldova, which is in great need of EU assistance during this period of transition to democracy.
<D>
(ES) Mr President, with this new year two new countries have joined the Euro zone and adopted our single currency.
This brings to the forefront once again a demand that should already be a reality in an advanced, modern and progressive Union: gender equality on new coins.
This has been a constant theme in history: women have scarcely ever been portrayed on newly minted coins.
Female figures, contributions and work have never been given any symbolic recognition, not only in this respect.
Gender equality is one of the values on which we are building the European Union and in that context equality should extend to all areas.
It is important to recognise and support the action of so many women in different spheres - science, culture, education, politics - whose work, lives and names should be recognised, studied and remembered.
In some countries, such as my own, Spain, the Parliament has approved a proposal to this end.
This Parliament and the Commission should take the necessary initiatives and recommend to all the Member States that they take the appropriate measures to ensure that when Euro coins are being minted, equal consideration be given to references and images of both men and women.
<D>
Ladies and gentlemen.
Today we are discussing in the European Parliament one of the most important reports being debated during this plenary session.
We can see in this report key elements of the energy policy which we want to implement across the European Union, such as national emergency action plans, the energy security clause, the diversification of supply sources and keeping nuclear power in the energy mix.
All this indicates how flexible our policies and actions are and how rapidly they can be adapted to the current situations.
I feel that the regulation of commercial, association, partnership and cooperation agreements signed with producer and transit countries in order to establish a code of conduct and consequences for non-compliance is one of the EU's priorities in the wake of the gas crisis at the beginning of the year.
Furthermore, diversification of energy supply sources by establishing interconnections between Member States, implementing new supply routes like Nabucco and constructing LNG terminals must become current projects financed by the Commission.
Finally, I would like to congratulate Mrs Laperrouze for her report and I hope that it will be supported by the vast majority of our fellow Members.
Thank you.
<D>
Europe's policy on research and innovation is essentially based on the Seventh Framework Programme for Research, which runs from 2007 to 2013, the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme, which runs for the same period, and the cohesion funds, which likewise run over the same period.
In preparation for these three major programmes, the Commission put forward a long-term strategy and an action plan in 2005 and 2006.
The action plan was put forward in 2005, while the broadly-framed innovation strategy dates from 2006.
The results of these different programmes are set out in comprehensive documentation from the Commission and have often been discussed here in Parliament.
I would be happy, Mrs Ţicău, to provide you with all these documents once again.
Within the confines of Question Time, it is not possible to spell out their contents to you, but I do want to attempt to highlight the key points.
Through the Seventh Framework Programme for Research, we did experience a truly remarkable rise in European expenditure on research and development whilst a series of new instruments, in particular, the joint technology initiatives, were also created and these have proven their worth extremely well.
The cohesion funds are new and better suited to the aim of promoting research and innovation and it is really remarkable if you look at the figures - the provision for these areas in the cohesion and structural funds for the stated period is EUR 86 billion, which, in any case, is 25% of the total structural and cohesion funds.
A new instrument has been created within the scope of European structural policy, the JEREMIE support initiative, which, above all, is about providing easier access to capital for small and medium-sized enterprises.
This is being done in collaboration with the European Investment Fund.
The programme to promote innovation and competitiveness, which I am responsible for, is also essentially a programme that creates funding instruments.
The major share of the money is actually spent on facilitating access for small and medium-sized enterprises to funding instruments that are designed to improve their capacity to innovate.
I am sure you know that our European growth and employment policy does not have very many quantitative targets.
We do have one quantitative target, however, which has been unchanged since the year 2000.
That target is to spend 3% of gross domestic product on research and development.
We can already say, today, that this target will not be achieved.
Just looking at the percentages, however, is a little misleading, since, after all, the absolute figures for spending on research and development in the European Union from 2000 to 2006 rose by 14.8%.
That is a greater rate of increase than, for example, the United States.
Despite that, we have to say that the results are not satisfactory, for which reason the Council adopted a document entitled 'Vision 2020' for the European Research Area as far back as December of last year, which was concerned with the issue of whether we could mobilise greater funding for European research and development policy.
I do not want to hide from you my concern that the current economic recession threatens the long-term strategy of driving forward research and development.
The Commission reacted very quickly to this threat in November 2008.
The European Economic Recovery Plan, which complements the Member States' measures to combat the economic crisis and aims to provide impetus and counter the difficult situation in the financial sector, is heavily focused on the areas of investment in research and development and promoting investment.
I will give you three examples: the Factories of the Future initiative, which relates to the modernisation of Europe's industrial base, with EUR 1.2 billion in funding; the Energy-efficient Buildings initiative, for which EUR 1 billion has been allocated; and the Partnership for Building Green Cars, which has also been allocated EUR 1 billion in the field of research, topped up with expenditure amounting to EUR 4 billion from other economic measures.
The Commission has already begun preparations for the next growth and employment strategy.
Without giving away any secrets - as President Barroso has already discussed this in his guidelines - I can also say that research, development and innovation will play an absolutely key role in the next growth and employment strategy.
I have another comment to make on innovation.
Europe is actually in a pretty good position when it comes to research policy.
We have good, and in some cases outstanding, research capacities.
We also have very good results when it comes to technological development.
We could certainly be better, though, when it comes to innovation.
If we understand innovation to be the practical application of research and development work for products, services, design and methods - in other words, anything where a practical application is possible - we still see a huge potential to create additional growth and additional employment in Europe.
The Commission therefore announced this year that it is to bring forward an 'innovation act'.
An 'act' in this sense is a new political instrument that we developed for the first time in connection with small and medium-sized enterprises - you will remember the Small Business Act - and we will be bringing forward an innovation act that brings together legislative measures, policy initiatives and politically-binding guidelines in a major package.
I have endeavoured to direct this work in such a way that the new Commission will be free to decide when it wants to bring forward this innovation act.
You will understand that I cannot pre-empt that - it will be for the new Commission to decide.
The preparatory work, however, has already made good progress and I think I can say with certainty that Parliament will be dealing with the subject of this innovation act within the next year.
Allow me, in concluding, to say that we have seen good progress overall on a broad front over the last few years, although it has been very erratic.
It is necessary, in this regard, however, to take an even-handed view.
We cannot, for example, expect the new Member States to match the spending proportion of gross domestic product of the older Member States on research, development and innovation straight away.
I am very pleased to see, however, that the new Member States - especially those that are in greatest need of catching up - are also making up ground the quickest, so that I see developments overall as positive.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for allowing me to put my views on the Member's speech and to put my views more generally on the case under discussion.
The complaint relating to the Working Time Directive is connected with the judgments of the Court of Justice in the SIMAP and Jaeger cases concerning on-call working time, as has already been said.
This is a matter which the Directive does not expressly address.
Furthermore, according to many Member States, the interpretation made by the Court of Justice gave rise to fundamental problems and had a far-reaching impact on the financing and organisation of public health care and emergency services.
In an attempt to tackle the problems caused by these judgments, the Commission undertook extensive consultation in 2004.
It came to the conclusion that an appropriate solution was to propose an amendment which would clarify the application of the Directive in the field of on-call working time and time off in lieu.
This amendment was presented by the Commission in 2004.
In view of the exceptional importance of these matters for public health care services, the Commission decided in 2004 that it would not institute proceedings for infringement of the law in cases where the law would be changed by the proposed amendment.
The Commission acknowledges that, in this case, the time taken was unusually long, but I have given the reasons.
In view of the fact that the existing acquis remains in force until such time as the proposed amendment enters into force, the Commission left it open as to how to handle this actual complaint, and also other complaints relating to this matter.
Furthermore, in justifiable cases, it instituted proceedings for the infringement of the law in connection with complaints relating to the Working Time Directive, but not falling under the jurisdiction of the amendment.
The Commission is also carefully monitoring and analysing resulting amendments to the national regulations in all Member States and the reactions of legislators, national courts and representatives of workers and employers to the decisions of the Court of Justice.
This is very important, since the questions included in the actual complaint to which the report refers are in actual fact topical for more than one Member State.
The Commission will shortly submit to Parliament, in about two months time, a detailed report on the implementation of the Working Time Directive, providing complex and up-to-date information on compliance with the acquis, including the SIMAP-Jaeger judgments, in all 27 Member States.
The report will also include reactions to several proposals in the existing report.
As regards the conclusions relating to the handling of proceedings for infringement of the law in general, the Commission is of the opinion that, in view of the specific context of the complaint under the terms of the Working Time Directive, relating to changes to on-call working time, it is not appropriate to deduce general conclusions on the handling of proceedings for infringement of the law which the Commission normally conducts.
The period of one year for decisions on complaints received by the Commission is usually appropriate, but is laid down expressly as a general principle which need not apply in all cases.
<D>
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (PL) Mr President, the role played by women in science appears to differ among the individual EU Member States.
In the very difficult times under Communism, women in Poland had access to science and political rights significantly earlier than in many countries of the old EU.
Previously, the problem was - and it still is today - more one of a poor economic situation and opaque criteria for allocating resources to scientific research, usually regardless of gender.
Despite these obstacles, there are many women who, as wives and mothers, fulfil important social functions, working as ministers, directors, deans and professors at higher education institutions or as doctors, without feeling that they are being discriminated against by men.
Contrary to what strident feminists say, in my country women are generally respected; they do not have complexes but rather an awareness of their own value and strength, in the knowledge that, in cooperating with men, they are playing an important role in all areas of life, while, however, placing the highest value on defending life, protecting marriage and the family and other supreme values.
The percentage of women students is constantly on the rise, and by the 1990s it was already 51%.
According to reports, women make up 38% of scientific workers in EU countries in Central and Eastern Europe, although a large number of them are employed in fields in which expenditure on scientific research is low.
It therefore seems right to suggest that more funds be made available, accompanied by encouragement to take up scientific work, alongside the further strengthening of the position of women, especially through legal regulations enabling family and professional life to be reconciled, including financial and social recognition for domestic work with the aim of offering a genuinely free choice, but without parities or any change in the definition of excellence.
The percentage differentiation in management positions may be linked to the significant mental and physical effort being too much of a burden, so the representation of women should be put into practice by recognising and utilising knowledge and individual predispositions along with improving legal and economic conditions and aid infrastructure, which make it easier to reconcile family life with one's occupation.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - I wish to begin by saying that of course we are following all the data and everything that concerns the framework programme.
This is available and we can provide you with the data.
We also have regular monitoring reports, which are envisaged until the end of the year and, in addition, we will have a progress report - I think at the end of May 2009.
But the progress report is much more: it is about providing the input of ideas on how we should proceed in the future.
Part of the logical implementation of the framework programme is to follow what you do and where you are investing or spending the funds.
Concerning tax-free income: I was always in favour of using those instruments which would stimulate science and research, including tax-free incomes.
One of the problems which we have to deal with in this crisis and difficult situation is how to stimulate research and development so we are not in the same situation as companies.
Because of the pressures, they would certainly consider reducing investment in research and development.
This avenue is one of the possibilities, but we also have to be aware that we have a flexible growth and stability pact, which has to be followed, and we have to consider that the situation is certainly not the same in all Member States.
Member States have different kinds of manoeuvres which they have established during the good times, when economies were better.
Finally, you asked me about the ethical approach, which was also mentioned in another question.
I think we have truly invested a lot in order to reach an agreement on which to base our ethical approach in science and research and also when we are using the framework programmes.
Agreement is difficult.
There are different views across the European Union Member States, and we can be quite proud that we have established something like clear ethical procedures which are, in reality and in practice, proving to be based on true ethics.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, on behalf of the Commission I would like to welcome this initiative by Parliament to bring the issue of profiling, notably on the basis of ethnicity and race, in counterterrorism, law enforcement, immigration, customs and border control, to the centre of attention at European level.
The Ludford report represents a very good platform that contributes further to this issue by launching a broad discussion and suggesting how to tackle this problem.
I want to underline that already existing data protection legislation ensures a high level of protection of personal data - including sensitive data such as information on ethnicity or race - and applies regardless of the technology used.
Therefore, it is obvious that general data protection principles apply to profiling as one of the ways of data processing as well.
The Commission strongly believes that unjustified or unnecessary ethnic profiling is an unfair and prohibited practice, even when this is done for law-enforcement purposes or in connection with immigration, customs and border control, and is contrary to the fundamental values of the European Union.
Under important instruments proposed by the Commission - like the Schengen Border Code, Eurodac, SIS, VIS - the use of unjustified ethnic profiling techniques is not authorised.
For example, as regards border controls, the provisions of Article 6 of the Schengen Borders Code require that border guards execute checks with no discrimination against travellers on grounds of racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief.
I would also like to mention the activities of the Fundamental Rights Agency in this field.
The Agency is about to present a good practices handbook for combating and preventing ethnic profiling.
The Commission supports the inclusion in the 2010 work programme of the agency of joint training with FRONTEX, where the said handbook could be used.
The Commission also supports the inclusion in the 2010 work programme of the agency of a project on implementing Article 6 of the Schengen Border Code that aims at collecting data.
Finally, the Commission welcomes the minorities and discrimination survey that was presented yesterday.
The sections on law enforcement and border control provide us with further and recent data on experiences of ethnic profiling.
The Commission will, of course, carefully study the results of the Minorities and Discrimination Survey, which will be published chapter by chapter through the year.
But already now we can conclude that racism and xenophobia are still persistent phenomena in the European Union and that they affect the lives of members of ethnic minorities.
The Commission agrees with the draft report that processing of data for statistical purposes, including ethnicity, race or origin, could be used to identify indirect discrimination or unjustified law enforcement practices.
However, this angle has to be properly assessed.
Therefore, the Commission is looking into the opportunity to ask the Article 29 Data Protection Working Party to prepare an opinion on the processing of personal data for statistical purposes, including ethnicity, race or origin.
The Commission is also following closely the activities of the Council of Europe on the draft Recommendation on Profiling.
The Commission is about to launch a request to the Council for a mandate to be authorised to negotiate this draft recommendation.
As regards the need for a legal framework to define profiling, the Commission believes that the relevant EU legislation on border management and data protection is adequate to protect fundamental rights.
Indeed, it requires that any processing activity has to be grounded on a specific, recognised legal basis and respect particularly the principles of necessity, proportionality, purpose limitation and accuracy.
It is subject to supervision by independent public authorities.
Currently the framework also contains strict rules relating to the processing of sensitive personal data or automated decisions.
All these principles also apply to profiling as one of the ways of performing processing of personal data.
The Commission is committed - and I am personally committed - to fighting racism and xenophobia to the full extent of the powers conferred by the Treaties, and this includes cases where racism comes from public authorities.
The Commission is determined to reinforce our policy to fight racism and xenophobia in the Stockholm context, which should include tackling the issue of ethnic profiling.
Again, on behalf of the Commission, I very much welcome the draft report, and I look forward to its adoption in plenary tomorrow.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, we are currently facing an explosive mix of social decline, cultural conflicts, increasing democratic deficits, the threat of supply bottlenecks, inflation, imported security risks and a speculation bubble which could burst at any moment.
For far too long, the worrying developments in the labour market and citizens' concerns have been ignored.
It is high time to set the right priorities.
As regards the food crisis, I believe that renationalisation of agricultural policy is essential to maintain our self-sufficiency capability.
Problems of illegal mass immigration have to be resolved at last, and a sensible family and birth policy must be introduced for Europe's native population.
Citizens must be protected from EU-subsidised business relocations, and the waste of taxpayers' money and tax fraud must also be stopped.
We must halt the sell-off of the EU's family silver, which is being sacrificed to over-zealous privatisation, and we must also finally accept that the Lisbon Treaty project has failed.
If the EU shows itself to be amenable here, we can ride out the current crisis.
Otherwise, we are likely to witness the steady decline of the European Union.
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me say at once to the Commissioner that while I endorse what he said, I believe the situation is not so much difficult as dramatic.
I could confine my statement to quoting from the article in The Economist a few days ago.
'Garbage littered on city streets can be not only unhealthy but also politically hazardous.
It reminds voters of the fragility of civilisation - and can prompt them to turn on their elected representatives.'
That is the situation.
As everybody knows, Naples is famous for the film The Four Days of Naples, in which the local people rise up against the foreign invaders.
One newspaper wrote that the enemies in the land today are the people who sullied Naples' good reputation in the world.
A whole civilisation is being consumed.
The tragedy of the waste in Naples and Campania did not strike overnight but has been building up for 14 years; EUR 8 billion have been spent uselessly and TV pictures have shown Europe and the entire world how the city streets have become quite impassable.
The real tragedy began, as the Commissioner pointed out, on 21 December, when the municipal dust carts stopped their rounds because the tips were full to overflowing and there are no incinerators; there are impending health risks, and absolutely nobody, Commissioner, is talking about separate collection.
There are, in fact, no incinerators in Campania and waste management is in the hands of organised crime, the Camorra.
The Campania region has not managed to tackle a problem that, in short, is a question of ordinary administration, such as cleaning the city, because it did not wish to do so, because the regional administration and its president are the slaves of the organised crime that controls all business.
Some of the political forces that form part of Mr Prodi's government and all the opposition parties have called for the Regional Council to be dissolved and for the appointment of a commissioner with sweeping powers, as a reaction against the irresponsible Minister for the Environment, Pecoraro Scanio.
A mere 81% of the EUR 200 million contribution under the European plan for the period 1994-1999 has been used; there is no regional plan and so someone had to be sent in.
I hope the President will allow me to speak for a few moments more.
Under this arrangement contracts can be awarded without respecting the appropriate European regulations, which creates a vicious circle of illegality and inefficiency.
The real risk is of losing the EUR 330 million Structural Fund money.
The Commission has opened an infringement procedure against Italy; that was, unfortunately, inevitable, for certainly Campania is light years away from complying with the rules imposed by the European directives, which those in charge even in the government have disregarded.
We ask the Commission to carry out an inspection at the end of the month and to take a strong position on enforcing the use of incinerators.
That is something Europe can do and we also call on Parliament to carry out an inspection, for a qualitative leap (...).
<D>
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (HU) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, women's participation in higher education has increased dramatically over recent years.
This has not, however, resulted in an improvement in the ratio of women to men in the sciences.
The number of women in engineering has also risen in the past twenty years, but not by nearly as much as in other occupations and scientific disciplines.
As a result of the difficulties, a large proportion of women scientists abandon a career in science, and this is unacceptable and irrational.
It is more difficult for women to get ahead in their profession.
This is particularly apparent with regard to wages.
Women are less well represented in scientific institutions.
Female researchers are forced to choose between career and family.
The temporary breaks in women's careers in science due to family reasons make promotion of women difficult.
We must look at methods aimed at establishing a balance between working life and private life and apply best practice.
The Lisbon Strategy also requires us to apply the principles of gender equality in the field of research and development.
We must take more effective action in all areas of science, making recruitment procedures and promotion requirements more transparent.
We must strive to ensure gender equality in university and non-university research and in the governing bodies of these institutions.
The report is excellent, and I recommend its adoption.
I also congratulate my colleague Britta Thomsen who, as a researcher, has studied this subject in considerable depth.
Thank you for doing this.
<D>
Madam President, in the debate over so-called climate change, we take for granted a few disputable prerequisites.
Firstly, climate changes are real and dominantly caused by people.
Secondly, conclusions made by the IPCC Panel are the only valid results.
There are no other groups of scientists with different opinions on global climate change.
Thirdly, people are generally willing to discount their future and sacrifice current living standards.
Fourthly, European businesses and enterprises will survive in global competition, even with higher prices.
Fifthly, we will manage to persuade the rest of the world to follow our obligations.
As I listen to the debate, I realise that I am in a minority in this House, but let me stress my position.
Firstly, the outcomes of the IPCC Panel are exaggerated.
There are other groups of scientists who offer different positions on climate change and its causes.
Secondly, there is no evidence that mankind is dominantly causing climate changes.
Thirdly, climate change has become a fashionable political tool for manipulating people.
Fourthly, the conference in Bali proved that there is no widespread support for excessive and extremely expensive measures for handling climate change.
Fifthly, European producers will have to incorporate political decisions into prices, which will subsequently result in higher prices and further loss of European competitiveness at global level.
Sixthly, ambitious plans for the reduction of greenhouse gases will harm developing countries, which will lead to deeper differences between the rich and the poor.
So what should be done?
We had better reduce the legendary European red tape, limit the production of legislation at a supranational level and let people work and invent.
<D>
(ES) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I think that it is clear that Brazil, due to its size, its population, its natural resources and, above all, its role on the international stage - I am thinking about the role that it is playing in the reform of the United Nations system, the role that it is playing in relation to the whole subject of climate change and the debate on energy resources - fully justifies the Communication presented by the Commission in terms of being able to benefit from a strategic partnership between the European Union and the great country that is Brazil.
And this strategic partnership, in my opinion, needs to be on three levels: from a global perspective, a regional perspective and a bilateral perspective.
However, it is one thing to give Brazil the treatment it deserves as the great country that it is, and another for the European Union not to continue with its commitment to the work that it has been doing to conclude the Agreement between the European Union and Mercosur.
I do not think that this was the Commission's intention in its Communication; I think that we can clearly gather from this Communication that the two hypotheses are perfectly compatible: on the one hand, the strategic dimension with Brazil, and, on the other hand, determined support for integration processes, of which the European Union is the most complete and obvious example.
Another thing is the Association Agreement between the European Union and Mercosur not being concluded on the terms that we would all like, and it is an agreement that has been delayed for too long now.
The question is a legitimate one: How long is the European Union going to keep waiting to conclude this agreement?
I think that we need to support regional integration processes, and it is only with this perspective, only in this dimension, that we will understand the advantages of union and integration.
<D>
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FI) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, my sincere thanks go to Mr Schnellhardt for his excellent work and cooperation.
It is good that we have had a first-rate expert in the field as our rapporteur on this issue.
The main objective of the regulation before us is the guarantee of hygiene and human health and safety.
I would now, however, like to mention another detail, which is important for protecting biodiversity and small-scale entrepreneurship in nature tourism in my country.
I am pleased that political consensus was found within Parliament and also with the Council of Ministers to resolve this issue.
This is about small-scale operations which take the carcasses of dead animals on farms with livestock, in pigsties for example, directly to feeding sites in the country for wild animals to feed on.
This is important, for example, in Spain, to maintain the wild bird of prey population.
In Finland such practices saved the white-tailed eagle from extinction back in the times when its natural food supply was too contaminated owing to chemical toxins, and when white-tailed eagles would not have been able to breed just by surviving on natural food sources.
In the northern, very sparsely populated parts of Finland, nature photographers use this method to attract wild animals to places where they can be photographed, and small travel companies also organise bear watching safaris, for example.
I am very glad that this legislation would provide a solution which would safeguard human health and safety but also preserve small-scale tourism entrepreneurship and the use of the method to protect biodiversity.
<D>
- (NL) The delegation from the PvdA (Dutch Labour Party) supports this directive's objective, namely to penalise the employment of illegal immigrants with a view to discouraging working illegally as one of the factors attracting illegal migrants, whilst at the same time aiming to prevent and control the exploitation of migrants.
Despite a number of positive elements in this compromise, we felt compelled to vote against it for a number of reasons.
Initially, there was liability covering the entire chain right up to the main contractor.
Unfortunately, this clause did not make it into the compromise between the Council and Parliament, which is now restricted to the first stage in outsourcing or subcontracting.
This is counterproductive and encourages more outsourcing in order to avoid social liability.
Furthermore, there are insufficient guarantees that migrants will be protected and employers punished for breaking the rules.
Migrants will not be entitled to receive any outstanding wages before they are deported, nor will they be allowed to wait for their pay in the European Union.
The chances of them getting their money after they have been deported are non-existent.
This means that illegal immigrants who become the victims of exploitation and want to fight for their rights hardly stand any chance at all.

(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe has not protected people from financial speculation.
Even the New York Times printed the prophetic saying by Ezra Pound that 'with usura hath no man a house of good stone'.
Today the Federal Reserve and the US Treasury would like to paper over the cracks by lowering rates.
It was this solution - easy access to credit - that caused the speculative bubble in the first place.
In 1933, a group of economists in Chicago came up with a plan: to re-establish an exclusive state monopoly on issuing currency, prohibiting banks from creating counterfeit money, and imposing an obligation on banks to have a 100% reserve.
This made fractional credit fraud impossible and put an end to the financial games that were ruining ordinary people, hurting savers and crippling the real economy.
Nobel Prize winner Maurice Allais has always been openly critical of innovative finance, securitisation, derivatives and hedge funds, much beloved of the finance gnomes in a certain part of Europe's financial sector.
He quite rightly calls - as we have been for some time - for derivatives to be made illegal.
Let us adopt the Chicago Plan, the Allais Plan: reserving the creation of money for governments.
Enough of Europe being unsure of what to do.
Even the Pope has issued a warning that wealth means nothing.
<D>
Madam President, I am very much in favour of this agreement.
I believe it is a big step forward in the cooperation between the European Union and Tajikistan, which is a very important country for several reasons.
I just want to quote one contribution to the stability and security of our continent of the EU.
Tajikistan is at the crossroads of drug trafficking from Afghanistan to Europe and Russia.
At least 30% of the heroin produced in Afghanistan comes to Europe and Russia through Tajikistan.
Ten years ago, the international community started a big operation in Tajikistan, strengthening all the drug control apparatus, and I am very happy to see, ten years later, that it is working and that it is going ahead very well.
This agreement is a direct contribution to the stability and security of Europe.
I see there are still many limitations and colleagues underlined the problems in Tajikistan in terms of human rights, poverty and so on, but I believe this agreement is Europe at its best and I am very much in favour of it.
<D>
Ladies and gentlemen, trade can be the basis for lasting and fair development.
We will not eliminate poverty and hunger from the world without the help of the market.
Those who think differently sentence the poor to the perpetual use of aid, perpetual dependence and perpetual uncertainty as to the future.
Only building a true market economy can pull poor countries and their residents out of the trap of contemporary dependence.
Globalisation can be a blessing, and not a curse.
Suspension of negotiations in the Doha Development Round of the World Trade Organisation has done most harm to developing countries.
This is all the more distressing because it has happened at a time of food, fuel and economic crisis.
We should do everything possible to restore trust in the multilateral system of trade.
If a solution to this problem is not found, the poor, the excluded and the threatened will be left where they are.
Thank you very much.
<D>
in writing. - (FR) The social economy needs more than ever to have a specific legal framework and Mrs Toia's report is a step in the right direction.
The European Commission has withdrawn two proposals intended to put in place statutes for European mutual societies and associations.
At a time when the cracks in the capitalist system are obvious, it is odd to withdraw proposals that promote alternative and effective types of economic organisation.
Founded on principles of mutualisation and interdependence, the social economy advocates a new concept of business practice that is more human and breaks with the capitalist approach of the simple pursuit of profit.
It has been expanding successfully in recent years and today represents 10% of businesses and 6% of jobs in the European Union.
The Commission's attitude may be deplorable, but nonetheless we can feel pleased about Parliament's vote.
The call for the characteristics of the social economy to be taken into account in the framing of European policies is to be welcomed, as is the demand for reactivation of the specific budget heading.
<D>
(FR) Mr President, this must be the umpteenth report on the so-called rise of extremism in Europe.
The Council, the Commission and the political groups have all pitched in with their tuppence-worth and, as usual, the rhetoric is intellectually pitiful, politically disgraceful and morally perverse.
It is intellectually pitiful because every new idea that ever was - in religion, including the Christianity that some of you are bold enough to say you espouse; in politics whether liberalism or socialism; in science, including concepts now taken for granted, like the earth being round and rotating about the sun - has been considered extremist, heretical, subversive and unacceptable.
You cannot discredit an opinion simply by demonising it: you need to explain what makes it flawed.
The political disgrace is entirely of your making - you, the people in power who, instead of resolving problems, care only about fighting off the opposition.
All you are doing is highlighting your inability to solve the problem of immigration - of an invasion in which you, either deliberately or through cowardice, have colluded.
What you are admitting here is that you have failed - on the economic front, the social front, the cultural front and the moral and educational fronts - and that, instead of changing your disastrous policies, your only concern is to get rid of those who protest or who criticise you.
It is in moral terms, however, that your attitude is most repugnant.
You falsely equate violence and terrorism with the legitimate reaction of Europe's people against the destruction of their identity.
What hypocrites you are!
You want to muzzle these people and deprive them of political representation: you are the Pharisees of democracy!
You are what the Bible calls 'whited sepulchres'; in other words, your sincerity is less than skin deep!
You talk about human rights and freedom of expression, about Europe's values and about tolerance, but underneath the whitewash it is all rot.
You would deny to anyone who fails to think like you the very rights that you harp on about.
All of this would be odious, were it not so grotesque.
Tomorrow's generations will pass judgment on you as the Barbarians passed judgement on Rome.
I hope, at least, that the Barbarians will give you what you deserve!
<D>
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, this motion for a resolution on supporting scientific cooperation with Africa is very timely, because it comes hot on the heels of a series of statements on science in Africa over the last 12 months - by the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa in January 2007, in the G8 Summit Declaration about strengthening research and development cooperation and in the new chapter on ICT and science and technology in the EU-Africa Strategy.
With the Science with Africa conference in Addis Ababa coming up in March, this is indeed the moment for the European Parliament to register its support for a new and intensified approach to EU-Africa scientific cooperation.
Of course, there have been initiatives in the past.
There have been scholarships and research fellowships to help African scientists come and work in Europe.
There has been support for certain projects.
But what there has not been is fully developed two-way scientific cooperation between Africa and the EU.
There is not yet a solid research base within Africa for Africa.
The statistics say it all.
Africa has only 1% of the world's scientific researchers, but 13% of the world's population.
Only 1 in 10 000 people in Africa is a scientist or engineer, whereas the figure is 1 in 200 in industrial nations.
Yet, because of climate change, there is no part of the planet where research is more vital.
Global warming in Africa threatens to wipe out the modest progress that has been made towards the Millennium Development Goals.
But, if only the science and technology base was stronger, climate change could also be an opportunity for Africa.
This motion for a resolution rightly makes specific mention of solar energy.
It is the renewable energy which Africa has in abundance.
Huge advances are being made today in photovoltaic technology.
Last Friday, I was at the New and Renewable Energy Centre in Blyth in Northumberland, where innovative research is going on to reduce the cost of solar electricity by focusing the sun's rays on very small silicon cells.
I am delighted that this research is happening in my constituency, but unless such research and development happens in Africa too, the immense potential of photovoltaics to deliver megawatts of electricity across Africa will never be realised.
I hope that this is the sort of scientific cooperation we are now moving towards.
<D>
in writing. - Cloning animals for food is a topical issue at the moment.
Broadly speaking, I am not against cloning in terms of scientific research and animal breeding development.
However, in terms of animal welfare and food safety, I am totally opposed to cloned animals entering the food chain.
Research and past experience have proven that cloned animals are more prone to disease and have a reduced life expectancy.
Although I do not wish to stand in the way of science, it is clear that we are not yet fully aware of the all the consequences and implications of cloning, both in terms of animal welfare and human consumption.
It is for this reason that clear criteria and controls should be implemented to ensure that cloned animals are prevented from entering the food chain.
While I realise that this is a sensitive topic, I believe that we should err on the side of caution.
Product quality, animal welfare and environmental concerns should remain our priority in terms of food production.
<D>
Mr President, in just the same way as the Baltic Sea became an internal EU sea in 2004, so the historical experiences of the 10 new Member States that suffered under the totalitarian rule of communism have become an all-European problem.
I absolutely agree with Mr Cohn-Bendit: we need a uniform or common interpretation of our common history.
So it is not a question of condemnation; it is a question of moral and political assessment of all the crimes.
We are called upon to guarantee that all crimes against humanity, all acts of genocide and classicide and all war crimes should be treated equally.
Justice belongs to all citizens of Europe without any exception.
In that sense, I am a bit disappointed with the Commission statement, because the main theme is that the assessment of communist totalitarianism will be an internal affair for every relevant country.
I am afraid it is going to deepen double standards, because clearly Nazism and fascism are not considered to be internal matters in any of the EU Member States.
Every emergence of neo-Nazism and racism is viewed as a direct threat to the common values of Europe.
So, what do we need to do?
There are still tens of millions of living victims of communist regimes, as well as their descendents.
As things stand today, they are bound to feel like second- or third-class victims.
The famous 'never again' is still not guaranteed for them.
Lastly, this is not a problem of the past.
The absence of a political and moral assessment is continuously shaping our present day and is distorting our common future.
Could one imagine the return of the Soviet KGB leadership to power in Russia or a revival of communist political forces in Germany if there had been an assessment of the communist system at the end of the Cold War?
<D>
(HU) Peter Mandelson is leaving the sinking ship and giving up his captain's bridge.
He is leaving a ship which he himself has steered towards an iceberg.
It was a mistake to give such extravagant concessions, especially in agriculture, at the very beginning of the negotiations.
This gave no incentive to our trading partners to offer concessions themselves.
We have become a laughing-stock for, while we are ditching the Common Agricultural Policy, the other negotiating partners are protecting their own agricultural policy and strengthening the position of farming in America.
The WTO negotiations cannot be carried on from where they were left off.
Negotiations can only be continued if they cover environmental issues too.
Otherwise further liberalisation of world trade will lead to even more offensive devastation of the environment and the acceleration of climate change.
Is it right, when we are suddenly in the middle of a financial and food crisis, to sacrifice Europe's food security and its agriculture just so that our bankrupt banks are better able to export their misdirected services?
<D>
Member of the Commission. - First of all I do not see a reduction of VAT as a possible solution.
Today we have oil prices of approximately USD 136-137 per barrel; if we were to reduce the VAT what would be the next question if we then had an oil price of USD 160 - would we reduce it further?
We have to be much more forward-looking when trying to find solutions and here we have encouraged investments in reducing the dependency on oil.
That is possible within the agricultural sector and we are now discussing it for fisheries as well, because fisheries is even more dependent on oil prices.
Therefore, investments in new technologies is much more forward-looking than just reducing the VAT.
In response to the other question raised, we will present a proposal this year for the most deprived people within the European Union.
We have a scheme in place already, but its survival is based on surplus stocks - intervention stocks of agricultural products - and we do not have anything on intervention any more.
Therefore we need the legal basis for a new scheme and I hope that the honourable Members will be satisfied when they see what we are considering as a way to continue or even increase the economic basis for such a scheme.
I completely agree that we need to find decent solutions.
<D>
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by making it clear that the distribution of food to deprived people is, for me, not at issue in the forthcoming vote on the report by Mr Siekierski, particularly in these difficult economic times.
I would therefore also like to make it clear at the outset that it was not easy to find a common line within our Group.
I therefore respect the personal decision of any member of the Group to deviate from this and not to support our intended rejection of the report.
Why am I unable to support the result of the committee vote as it stands?
There are a number of reasons for this, which have absolutely nothing to do with helping deprived people within the European Union in these difficult economic times.
On the contrary, amendments tabled by my colleague Mr Busk on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, although unfortunately found not to be permissible, were intended to give the existing system a future-oriented foundation.
The system in place up to now is an anachronism from the times of agricultural overproduction, which fortunately are now a thing of the past.
Due to the successful decoupling of direct payments, the intervention stocks have been constantly decreasing in recent years, with the result that, today, up to 85% of the food has to be purchased on the free market.
However, that has altered the fundamental nature of the programme and has resulted in the loss of the agricultural dimension to the programme.
Since we are now dealing with a social programme, we need to create an appropriate legal basis for it.
In this regard, we share the view of the Council's legal services that the only possible legal basis in place of Article 37 of the EC Treaty regarding the common agricultural policy is Article 308, as otherwise it would clearly constitute an encroachment on the national competences of the Member States.
In view of the impermissible nature of our amendments, the only solution can be a new draft from the European Commission.
The Commission should also take to heart the principle of co-financing, as whether or not such programmes are meaningful in the mind of everyone can only be satisfactorily assessed at local level.
<D>
The next item is Question Time (B6-0231/2009).
The following questions have been submitted to the Council.
Mr Kohout is here representing the Council.
I should like to take this opportunity to welcome the decision made today by the Czech Senate, which gives us high hopes of the future ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon.
Subject: Protection of European creative works
Given that European creative works are being undermined by the growing plethora of pirated copies, what measures does the Council propose in order to afford real protection?
<D>
Mr President, I believe that the case of Romania and of Bulgaria is worthy of debate, but we really are in an extremely serious situation here.
As regards the conclusions, I should like to thank the rapporteurs from the political groups and all of the speakers, especially the Committee on Budgetary Control.
I should like to conclude on several issues.
Firstly, there is no fraud where the budget is concerned.
Secondly, we have many errors, and this is for two reasons.
The first is that our regulations are too complex, and so final beneficiaries find it difficult to apply them and commit errors, which are not too serious.
The second reason is that the European Court of Auditors applies too low a materiality threshold: 2% to all sectors; as audit methods go, these ones must be re-examined.
Thus, it is said that things are going badly, but because we are all responsible.
The Commission is responsible because it has not kept its promise, and thank you, Commissioner, for examining the proposals for the next mandate.
The Council is responsible because it is losing interest: it is not here.
The Member States are responsible because they are not applying the regulations with enough rigour.
The European Court of Auditors is responsible because it must reflect on its audit methods, and in particular on the materiality levels; it is the responsibility of the Court, not of the Commission or Parliament, to lay down the materiality thresholds.
Parliament is responsible because it must be clear about the current imperfections and must accept the reforms.
In short, I believe that we have a series of joint responsibilities.
The summary is done at the end of this mandate.
Well, we hope and pray that this reform will take place so that we will at last have a positive statement of assurance, in forthcoming financial perspectives.
We hope too that if we have a negative statement of assurance, we will have a negative vote from Parliament, so that there is political consistency between the bodies that have to take budgetary control decisions.
<D>
- Madam President, one source of human exposure to PCBs is through the food chain, as the Commissioner says.
However, open fires and cigarette smoke are far greater sources to a far greater number of people.
Let us be proportional and let us keep the hysteria out of this debate, and more light and less heat on it.
Minimum requirements for feed hygiene are indeed very important and must be rigorously enforced, but they must also be accompanied by full identification and traceability for all meat products - not just beef but also poultry, pigmeat and sheepmeat.
I have put down amendments to current legislation to that effect, and we will be discussing these in this House shortly.
The pig feed concerned was indeed contaminated by breadcrumbs because, inadvertently, Millstream Recycling used fuel to dry the breadcrumbs after buying this in good faith from a company it had dealt with for years and with which it had had no previous problems.
There is an ongoing police investigation and the company concerned is cooperating fully with them.
I would like to refute completely Mr Allister's claim that the company showed wanton disregard.
That will be proven not to be the case, so let us be careful what we say here.
The biggest problem was that we had to have 100% withdrawal of all pigmeat products, and their destruction, albeit only in the short term.
The livelihoods of many Irish farmers, and indeed the reputation of Irish food products abroad suffered because we had to have such a disproportionate response, when only six to seven per cent of our pig farms were contaminated, since the Irish system of identification and traceability failed at the point of the slaughter-house.
All pigs are supposed to be eartagged in Ireland, or slap marked, but somehow, at the slaughter-house level, we could not differentiate those pigs that had had the contaminated feed from the vast majority of other pigs that had not.
We need to look at that issue.
The Commission needs to look at the whole role of identification and traceability, and above all let us wait for the police investigation, which I think will surprise people.
The companies concerned are extremely sorry, and have said so publicly, for the damage caused to the food chain and Ireland's reputation, and indeed for the economic damage caused to the many farmers who have purchased their excellent feed products up to this point.
They are now back in business and again producing, I might say, an excellent feed ration for farmers to mix.
This has been an appalling episode.
No one would have wished it to happen.
<D>
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur and yourselves for the debate which has now begun, as it is a debate on an exceptionally sensitive and profound topic.
I think that the debate witnessed a whole range of views which might provoke vigorous discussion, as well as a whole range of views expressed in opposition.
Apart from anything else this underscores the significance and challenging nature of this debate.
I would like to stress a few of the fundamental ideas.
To start with, the rulings from the court in Luxembourg has not weakened or attacked fundamental rights.
There is simply no truth in this.
I would also like to state that the court in Luxembourg, apart from anything else, was the first to declare through its jurisprudence, that the right to strike was a fundamental right.
This had never previously been formulated in jurisprudence or in our legal system.
I would also like to respond to the notion often voiced in the debate that the question of posted workers is a matter which divides the old Member States from the new ones.
I can report that the country which posts the highest number of workers is the Federal Republic of Germany.
The country posting the second highest number of workers is Poland, the third is Belgium and the fourth is Portugal.
The idea that posting involves a movement from the East to the West, from the new to the old, is also not correct.
Equally incorrect is the idea that posting workers implicitly involves social dumping.
I would like to state that it is a basic policy of the Commission to reject and oppose actively any form of dumping, and that includes social dumping.
It is also a policy of the Commission to safeguard the social standards that we have achieved and not in any way to undermine them under any circumstances whatsoever.
I would also like to state that in the debate which was opened at the workshop, most of the Member States to which the rulings in the case of Laval, Rüffert applied did not take the view that we should amend the directive.
A clear majority of them saw a solution within the framework of applying national law and a number of them are well on their way in this process.
I would like to mention Denmark and Luxembourg, and I would also like to state that, according to information I have received from Sweden, a very important decision is due to be taken there within about fifteen days, a decision which has been discussed in great depth and detail by the social partners and the government.
I would also like to state, although this is a detail, that the so-called firms with PO box addresses are not a manifestation of the posting of workers or of freedom of movement.
You may find a few hundred examples of these within the framework of the internal market of individual states and it is in my view an open question.
Another very significant matter which I would like to stress is that the judgments handed down so far by the court in Luxembourg are responses to an earlier issue.
It rests with the national courts to make definitive rulings as this lies within the authority of the national courts.
Ladies and gentlemen, I feel it is absolutely necessary to stress that this is a very fundamental issue.
The Commission is following it from the standpoints that we have been talking about and is prepared to take any necessary measures to resolve the situation and to find a corresponding consensus, because to reiterate once again, it has not been clear even in this debate where the dividing line lies.
There is much work still to be done but allow me to state and to emphasise that the importance of the social partners in this area is vital.
<D>
rapporteur. - (FR) Madam President, Commissioner, I think we should not forget what we are trying to achieve.
Despite what some subjective studies would have us believe, it is not the 13% of Europeans downloading cultural content illegally who are threatening our culture, but it seems to me that it is the concentration of our culture in the hands of a few large groups that is damaging our diversity and therefore the richness of our cultural heritage.
I will only give you one example, that of records.
Today, 95% of what is distributed comes from the four big record companies.
I believe it is important to ensure that consumers have genuine choice and it is necessary to guarantee pluralism of content in a very concentrated market where those chiefly responsible for innovation and creativity are small, not big.
You were talking about SMEs, Commissioner, recommending a study which I think is a really interesting idea.
The permission for a merger between Sony and BMG granted by the Commission totally contradicts the European policy to support SMEs in the music industry, which create more jobs than the large companies and represent 99% of the market players and 80% of innovation in this sector.
It seems, therefore, that there is an urgent need to support diversity in the cultural sector, which is a genuine driver of growth and a means of development for individuals.
In conclusion, I will say that it is the diversity of culture that makes it rich and not the other way around.
<D>
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in the realm of climate policy, the year 2007 - and some time has already elapsed since then - is regarded as the year when the reality of climate change was officially acknowledged.
If we consider that the debate on global warming and sustainability strategies has been running for almost two decades, it becomes clear how long it takes to influence such a political process and how difficult it is to effect an actual strategic realignment.
Even though we hear assurances throughout the EU that the pursuit of sustainability has finally been incorporated into the Lisbon Strategy, I still doubt whether we are really serious about this sea change and whether we are really prepared to strike out in a new direction and turn away from a purely quantitative growth target to pursue the aim of quality-driven growth.
When we were preparing the Lisbon resolution for Parliament, with Mr Lehne and myself as co-rapporteurs, we argued once again - not we personally but our political groups - about the issue of energy policy and energy strategies.
It is no wonder that we did, for this issue is worth arguing about.
The resolution now enshrines a concept that barely conceals the potential gulf between our respective views on sustainability.
The term 'low-carbon economy' is now being presented as a compromise formula for this Parliament.
In my opinion, it merely papers over the conflict between the status quo, whose advocates would press on with the energy-based economy, fuelled by the old energy mix of coal and nuclear power, and the strategy that we wanted, namely a radical change of course designed to cut resource consumption.
This concept which we have now incorporated thinly veils our continuing failure to take a decision.
Let me reiterate at this point that Europe, in my view, could not possibly play the pioneering role which would fulfil the hopes of people throughout the world on the basis of high-risk nuclear energy or of a renewed reliance on coal.
I shall move on now, but we shall resume this argument in another context.
I also believe, Mr Verheugen, that the adjustment of the guidelines in this area is yet to happen, because simply appending security of energy supply and renewables does not amount to a change of strategy.
A new strategy is quite a different matter and has to be reflected in new measures and instruments.
I believe, however, that the need to alter the guidelines of the Lisbon strategy is not confined to the environmental dimension but also extends to the domain of social policy.
We keep hearing of an upturn in European growth and employment over the last three years.
At the same time, however, we have seen social marginalisation and an increase in the number of insecure jobs.
In our opinion, the common aim of social integration and cohesion can only be interpreted to mean, in plain and simple terms, that working people in Europe must be able to live on what they earn.
I was therefore puzzled by the squabbling between the political groups during the preparation of the Lisbon resolution on the question whether it is right or wrong to conclude agreements on minimum wages in Europe on an industry-by-industry basis.
I do not believe there is any alternative, and I only wish there were a greater degree of consensus on that point.
I also wish that my fellow Members on the right of this House would not always interpret the concept of 'flexicurity' to mean only that the weakest members of society need to be flexible and submissive while the others are free to continue conducting their business as they see fit.
Something I regard as a very important aspect of the resolution that will be put to the vote tomorrow - and this remark is also addressed to Mrs Figueiredo, who played a leading part in this success - is that we have managed to present joint proposals for new indicators with which progress towards achievement of the Lisbon objectives can be measured, particularly the objective of improving people's quality of life.
The fact that the income-based approach in the form of that old landmark indicator, the national-income growth rate, completely overlooks disparities in income growth shows that it is not in any way an adequate indicator.
It becomes even more inadequate, of course, if we actually want to measure factors such as improvements in the quality of life and in the state of the environment.
I would be delighted if the Commission were to respond to these comments regarding environmental and social indicators.
<D>
Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentleman, I should like to join the Minister in thanking Parliament for having included this European Union-Latin America and Caribbean Summit on the agenda for its plenary sitting.
This will be the fifth top-level meeting between our regions since our strategic partnership was launched at the Rio Summit in 1999.
The Lima Summit will place particular emphasis on two specific topics: firstly, the fight against poverty, inequality and exclusion, and secondly, climate change and energy.
The Summit is taking place in a very stimulating climate.
The Latin America-Caribbean region is changing very fast.
For the first time, the gross domestic product of the region has increased by an average of 5% over the past five years.
Hence public budgets have increased and that is enabling the region to address the risks of social equality, which are still significant.
It must not be forgotten that over 200 million people still live in poverty there.
The region is also becoming increasingly important internationally as a producer of agricultural products and biofuels.
These developments are part of a political context divided between democracy, which is still the most common system in the region, and a growing trend towards populism, indeed, in some cases, the strengthening of executive power at the expense of parliamentary government and the primacy of law.
As you know, Europe is involved at very many levels.
With the region, it has committed itself to resolving those structural problems.
Europe is still the main donor for development cooperation, the biggest foreign employer.
As the second trading partner for the region, Europe leads the field in investment, which is considerably higher than investment by China.
Our general association agreements with Chile and Mexico have had a significant impact on the growth in our trade since they were first introduced.
We are now at the third stage of the negotiations for the signature of association agreements with the Andean Community and Central America, which there is every indication will happen in the near future.
We are working on promoting and supporting regional integration, sharing the positive experience of Europe in that respect.
Similarly, we are currently negotiating with Mercosur on the possibilities for getting things moving again in the present situation.
We have recently signed a strategic partnership with Brazil, which should lead to the initiation of a first joint action plan by the end of this year.
The Caribbean region is the first, and so far the only one, to have successfully negotiated an economic partnership agreement with the Union under the Cotonou Agreement.
We are, of course, continuing to support democracy and human rights throughout the region, both through cooperation programmes and also, where necessary and only when requested, through election observation missions.
Finally, I shall outline the priorities for the Summit and the immediate future.
Social cohesion and regional integration, in view of their importance for economic and political stability, and multilateralism, since the values of the two regions are very similar, must remain the political priorities for the European Union-Latin America-Caribbean partnership.
The main objective of the European Union for the Lima Summit is to consolidate the existing strategic partnership and move it forward in two areas, social cohesion and sustainable development, which will be of crucial importance to our relationship with the region in the immediate future.
As regards social cohesion, the European Commission has been implementing major aid and cooperation programmes to reduce poverty in the region.
Forty per cent of the EUR 2.6 billion cooperation and development allocation for the next six years is being used to resolve social cohesion problems.
As regard the environment and climate change, we want to cooperate more with the region in order to meet this global challenge.
On the initiative of the Commission, the first European Union-Latin America-Caribbean ministerial dialogue on the environment was opened in March 2008, as a prelude to the Lima Summit.
We need to seize the opportunity that is open to us to ratify with our partners the existing relationship between sustainable development and climate change, even if many countries in Latin America still devote very little attention to the problems of climate change, in spite of its negative and sometimes disastrous impact on the region.
Finally, the European Union must emphasise the important role that it continues to play in promoting this regional integration and the positive effect of the integration on the economic and political stability of the sub-regions.
That is the information that I have for Parliament and I shall obviously be very interested in the speeches that follow.
<D>
in writing. - The liberalisation of postal services is an important area of the European internal market.
Throughout the discussion we have had many concerns about universal postal services.
I think we can build on the experience of some European postal markets, which are already liberalised.
Postal services have been secured in these countries at the same time as quality and service has improved through more businesslike operations.
At the same time, travelling around in Europe I am faced with poor and slow service in many countries that are trying to get as many exceptions as possible from the liberalisation plans.
Furthermore, this report leaves much space for Member States to implement the liberalisation.
Many concerns that were brought up will thus remain concerns to be dealt with by national authorities.
I would like to thank Mr Ferber for his perseverance while dealing with this very tough process.
<D>
A strong Europe, the establishment of effective economic management in the EU, rapprochement with the EU's neighbours; we wish to support the Hungarian Presidency in its work towards these priorities.
It is also particularly important for us that the Hungarian Presidency is counting on a close partnership with the European Parliament.
There is one more issue I would like to highlight, as a Member dealing with institutional matters and, at the same time, a representative of the country which will take the helm of the European Union from Hungary.
The Hungarian Presidency is extremely important, not only because of its priorities, which coincide with those of Poland, but also because it is still a transitional Presidency.
The Treaty of Lisbon weakened the role of the Presidency, but this role has not yet been fully delineated, and now is the last chance to do so.
The range of instruments subsequently available to the Poles will depend on the place the Hungarian Presidency succeeds in finding for itself within the institutional jigsaw puzzle that is the EU.
I shall watch its work with all the more interest for this reason.
to this end.
I also welcome the Hungarian Presidency's intention to produce a political agreement on establishing a European framework for Roma integration, as well as its intention to launch the implementation of the European Disability strategy.
<D>
(NL) Mr President, this late in the day, when only our dogged spokesmen on agriculture and the agriculture Commissioner are still with us - for which my thanks, Commissioner - milk may not be the most obvious refreshment we are thirsty for, especially after the previous debate.
But we must not forget that we are talking here about one of the giants of European agricultural production.
Every Member State of the EU is a dairy producer and dairy accounts for no less than 14% of Europe's agricultural output.
Notwithstanding its relatively modest share of the farm budget, it must be said.
The dairy sector also offers us quality products and a choice of regional specialities.
General De Gaulle made a connection between this great diversity of products and his country's governability.
'How can you govern a country which has 246 kinds of cheese?' he asked rhetorically.
What this French observation might mean for a European Union of 27 Member States and no doubt thousands of kinds of cheese, well, we won't go into that this evening.
We must not forget the contribution which dairy farmers make to our countryside.
A sector to be proud of, then, but one which has not had an easy time of it in recent years.
It is tempting, in the light of those difficult years and present-day market developments, to dwell on questions which go beyond the scope of this debate.
I shall be the exception to the rule and will not do that, though most Members have given in to the temptation.
I will merely echo Struan Stevenson, who quite properly asks how much of the price rise actually feeds through to the farmers.
Back then to the subject of our debate: Mrs Jeggle's most excellent reports.
I specifically want to address the call to widen the school milk scheme.
The link between fat percentage and support has rightly been scrapped, so to me it makes sense, in widening the scheme, to think above all about innovative and healthy products, especially in view of Europe's growing obesity problem.
The Commissioner has already said that she is having talks on this with the Member States, but maybe she can tell us when we can expect concrete proposals on the subject and consequently when this package is actually likely to be expanded.
Lastly, I agree with the rapporteur that it is too soon to do away with existing safety nets altogether, even if they are not currently used, but that this too is a matter for the Health Check.
'To be continued', is the message, then.
<D>
on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr President, this is my first, or maiden, speech in this Parliament.
As a UKIP MEP for the East of England, you will expect me to be a rebel and I will try not to disappoint you or my voters.
We are discussing today EU trade agreements and, in particular, that with South Korea, due to be signed this year.
As we do not have much of the detail on this particular agreement, other than the fact, I believe, that two thirds of the benefits will accrue to South Korea and one third to the EU, I would like to make some more general points.
Many people are not aware that there are over a hundred separate bilateral EU trade agreements like this one; 116 is one estimate.
There are trade agreements with countries such as the USA, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, India, China, Japan and South Africa.
In Europe, there are trade agreements with Russia, Ukraine, Turkey and Liechtenstein.
There are also trade agreements with non-EU EEA and EFTA countries such as Switzerland and Norway.
Norway's trade agreement religiously protects both its fishing and farming, and Norway is not a minnow.
It is the EU's fourth largest import partner and sixth largest export market.
What should a trade agreement like South Korea's really contain, then?
Switzerland, I believe, is a strong example.
There are provisions abolishing customs duties and trade quotas on industrial and agricultural products.
There are provisions to allow Swiss citizens the right to live and work in EU countries and for EU citizens to live and work in Switzerland.
There are provisions for Switzerland to be part of the Schengen passport-free area.
The Swiss can be in the European Environment Agency, if they wish, in the EU's film and education programmes, and they can apply for EU research grants.
There is cooperation on airlines, asylum and judicial matters.
In short, they have all the claimed benefits of EU membership, but without the cost.
It is true that Switzerland must pay CHF 600 million per year for access, but the Swiss Government reports savings for not being a member of the EU amounting to CHF 3.4 billion, a net saving of CHF 2.8 billion a year.
Nor is Switzerland an insignificant trading partner either: 80% of Swiss exports go to the EU, and it is the EU's fourth largest trading partner.
My point is that trade agreements can achieve the benefits of EU trade without the burden of high regulatory costs, loss of sovereignty and of resources.
Even the Commission website admits 'Switzerland can develop and retain its own regulations in other areas which deviate from EU rulings.
It is in its own interests, such as in financial and in labour markets.'
How Britain would love to deviate in a similar way over the Working Time Directive, Temporary Workers' Directive or the new Fund Managers' Directive!
So I conclude in asking, why not Britain?
Why cannot Britain have a similar, friendly trade agreement with the EU like South Korea instead of full EU membership?
Britain on its own is the largest single trading partner with the EU with a GBP 40 billion deficit a year.
We, too, can have the kind of assurances the Swiss enjoy.
We could, and I believe we should, be an independent free trading nation once again such as Norway, Switzerland and even South Korea.
<D>
in writing. - The global financial crisis will rightly top the agenda of the October Council.
The crisis is man made - from the USA to the EU and beyond, the meltdown in the banking and financial sector is as shocking as it is real.
There is a sense of disbelief that the unthinkable - namely the collapse of the banking system - is now upon us.
The demise of individual banks and dramatic intervention of governments to shore up the fragile financial sectors has resulted in great public unease about the ability of politicians to protect them against such eventualities.
Banks do not want regulation, and it is now clear that regulation was weak and ineffective in protecting not just the banking customers but the very institutions themselves.
Yet, when times got tough for the banks, they ran to the politicians to rescue them.
So it is up to us to seize this moment and place the power back where it should always have resided, and that is in the political system, rather than in the financial markets.
<D>
Honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, for almost two decades the European Parliament has been awarding the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought to men and women from all parts of the world who campaign for human rights, freedom of speech and freedom of expression.
I am delighted to bid a very warm welcome today, here in the European Parliament, to the winner of the Sakharov Prize for 2007, Salih Mahmoud Osman.
(Applause)
It also gives me great pleasure to extend my warmest greetings to his wife, Salwa Ahmed Faragalla Ali, who has always stood by his side at difficult times in his life.
We welcome you among us.
(Applause)
The decision to award the 2007 Sakharov Prize to Salih Mahmoud Osman was taken unanimously by the Conference of Presidents, which comprises the chairs of the political groups, on the basis of a proposal adopted by a large number of Members of the European Parliament from various groups.
The European Parliament has thereby reaffirmed its solidarity with the people in Darfur and its conviction that a sustainable solution for that region can only be achieved through justice, democracy and respect for human rights.
The conflict that has plagued Darfur since 2003 is exacerbating the plight of a country devastated by more than twenty years of civil war.
As with most conflicts, it is the civilian population who have suffered most from militia raids, the destruction of villages, scorched-earth policies and forcible displacements.
The conflict has claimed at least 400 000 lives and has been responsible for more than two and a half million displaced persons and refugees, notwithstanding the signing of the peace agreement in Darfur in 2006.
Just like the European Parliament, the winner of the 2007 Sakharov Prize does not simply accept this unjust situation but protests against the impunity of those who caused it.
For years Salih Mahmoud Osman has been defending the rights of victims of the conflict in Darfur.
Thousands of people who have been imprisoned without trial, tortured and exposed to death threats, who have been driven from their homes, displaced or subjected to sexual violence are familiar with the name of Salih Mahmoud Osman.
His commitment is remarkable in several respects.
In a country where violence is constantly on the increase, Salih Osman risks his life on a daily basis in the cause of human dignity and justice.
In the name of human dignity, Salih Osman reassures those destitute, defenceless and intimidated men and women who have sunk into oblivion that the world is aware of their suffering, that they have not been forgotten and that they have reason to hope for a return to a perfectly normal and simply human life.
Since 2004, Salih Osman has been committing himself to the establishment and administration of the Amal Centre in Nyala, amal being Arabic for 'hope', for the rehabilitation of victims of violence and sexual abuse.
In a predominantly Muslim country, Salih Osman is one of the few men who campaign actively in support of women's rights and especially for recognition of the right to compensation for victims of sexual violence.
In the name of justice, Salih Osman strives, day after day, to ensure that those responsible for war crimes are held to account both nationally and internationally.
While the Sudanese judicial system still has many defects that make it unable to put an end to the prevailing climate of lawlessness within the country, international jurisdiction seems to offer an alternative.
The fact that the Sudanese authorities are refusing to hand over alleged war criminals to the International Criminal Court, however, highlights the limits of international justice and shows how much progress is still needed before the rule of law can be established in Darfur and throughout Sudan.
That is why Salih Osman's work is not confined to the legal aid he gives the victims.
As a member of the Opposition in the Sudanese Parliament since 2005, he does not hesitate to affirm his convictions in the Sudanese political arena and to engage in efforts to bring about genuine reform of the legal system.
At the meeting between the European Parliament and the Pan-African Parliament on the eve of last weekend's EU-Africa Summit in Lisbon, I had the opportunity and the great pleasure to meet Salih Osman.
I was immediately impressed by his strong personality and his unbending will to fight for human rights in spite of all the persecution and hostility to which he and his family have been subjected.
I learned a short while ago that Ali and you have three children, who are also very much in our thoughts today.
In 2004 Salih Osman himself was imprisoned for seven months without being charged, and it was only when he went on hunger strike that he was released.
Members of his family have been tortured and murdered or have had their houses set on fire by the militias.
The great German writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe once wrote, 'Knowing is not enough; we must apply.
Willing is not enough; we must do'.
Salih Osman embodies that kind of will and determination, showing his courage in his daily struggle on behalf of his fellow human beings.
He is an exemplary campaigner for greater respect for the rule of law in his region.
Salih Mahmoud Osman, you have our firm support and our warm acclaim.
As you know, the European Parliament has always been particularly receptive to the suffering of the African peoples.
Salih Osman is one of a number of African prizewinners to whom Parliament has given its support in past years and whom it continues to support.
Nelson Mandela was awarded the Sakharov Prize in 1988, Salima Ghezali in 1997, Dom Zacarias Kamwenho in 2001 and Hauwa Ibrahim in 2005.
Salih Osman, we congratulate you on your untiring work in this cause, in this spirit, and we hope that the recognition this prize brings might grant you strength and protection from year to year for as long as your struggle continues.
We are at your side.
(Applause)
<D>
(FR) Madam President, I have one minute to say to you that, despite the determination and the blindness of the European institutions, one thing should be obvious to everyone: the time has come to put an end to Turkey's accession process.
Negotiations have become bogged down, there is a mutual lack of understanding and a permanent state of ambiguity.
This situation is detrimental to all - to the European Union as well as to Turkey.
We have to stop the hypocrisy and the pretence.
We must remember one obvious fact.
Turkey is a country in Asia Minor.
Turkey is not a European country, either geographically or culturally.
Turkey is militarily occupying a part of a Member State of the European Union since, to this day, we have only ten negotiating chapters out of 35 and only one has been closed.
It is time for everyone to regain their freedom, independence and sovereignty, starting with Cyprus.
The people of Europe do not want Turkey in Europe.
Let us respect our people and show respect for Europe!
<D>
rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, fifteen years after the first election observation mission to Russia, and eight years after the first communication by the Commission on this subject, what assessment can we make of election observations?
Well, firstly a positive one.
The aim of this report, which was written jointly and in complete harmony with Mr Salafranca, was to highlight the successes achieved: the growing professionalism of the election observation missions, the creation of a body of experienced observers within the EU - successes that have meant that the budget of the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights is now close to 25% - and above all, the fortunate combination of two missions, each led by MEPs: that of the EU, which is more technical and long term, and that of Parliament, which is shorter and more political.
We need to keep forging ahead, however.
The main recommendations of this report are, in the first place, to open up the missions to ACP, EUROLAT and EMPA members, but very cautiously.
Care must be taken not to destroy professionalism and to maintain a European stamp on the missions.
Secondly, to keep the budget allocation at around 25% for the European Instrument for Human Rights and Democracy, draw up an annual report evaluating the year's missions - that is extremely important indeed -, look into the security of computerised elections - a new challenge for election observers - and above all, work much more on follow-up.
It is in the follow-up that the difficulty lies, and it is hard for elections to be the genuine lever for democracy that they should be.
The report describes a number of avenues for follow-up, but I will only mention political follow-up here, and here I am talking mainly to the Council.
It is unacceptable that, when representatives or presidents get themselves elected on a fraudulent basis, European Union policies towards them go on as if nothing had happened.
Business as usual.
It is also unthinkable - and disastrous - that when representatives are elected on a democratic basis, they do not have the right to the respect and legitimacy that their election confers.
We have had unfortunate examples in the past that have led to tragic situations.
I do not want to make this a textbook case.
This report is consensus-based and not polemical, and Europe has in this an excellent instrument.
It should not deny itself that.
<D>
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall focus on two points.
Even today, billions of people have no access to water and hundreds of millions are dying as a result.
Climate change is bound to worsen the situation.
The price will be paid mainly by continents such as Africa, which are already enduring terrible conditions and, even though they pollute less, are harder hit by climate change.
The right to water must become a top priority for adaptation policies.
I say 'right' because this right has still not yet been sanctioned.
International documents refer to the 'need for water', whilst real military and economic wars are being waged with a view to appropriating water and turning it into a commodity.
It is therefore necessary to sanction the right to water and pursue policies enabling that right to be implemented.
In this sense it may be useful - and here I am addressing the Commissioner - to draw up a water protocol for inclusion in the text of the post-Kyoto agreements.
Along with water goes soil.
We have a European directive in need of approval.
We must combat desertification and promote the role of the soil as an agent of climate balance: that is the thrust of our directive.
Good agricultural practice, unlike for example the production of biodiesel, can guarantee both food output and carbon capture.
Adaptation, therefore, does not mean surrendering to climate change but intervening to combat it.
<D>
Mr President, the situation of the Roma in Europe is getting worse.
The developments in Italy prove that to us.
We have all seen that unchallenged xenophobic and racist hysteria can overcome common sense.
The crime of one single person has fuelled an unprecedented media lynching.
This moved us towards restrictions on the fundamental rights of European citizens based on popular racist and xenophobic hysteria.
We must not let that happen.
Criminal issues are for the judges to deal with, not for politicians or civilians.
However horrible and condemnable the crime that took place in Rome is, it should not lead us to collective responsibility of a whole nation.
The events in Italy did uncover the reality of the campo nomadi, in which so many Roma live.
The fact that tensions and instability arise from such situations is not questionable.
That is why we must act.
My first assistant is a Roma.
Integration can proceed quickly.
In 2005 we adopted a resolution that asked for concerted EU and national action for speeding up the inclusion of Roma.
Therefore, I propose that we, as MEPs, show that we care, and urge decision-makers to join us.
I propose that the EP establish a permanent European Parliament rapporteur on Roma issues, who would monitor the situation of the Roma in Europe and come annually with recommendations to the Commission and governments.
In addition, we should call upon the Commission to establish an EU Roma inclusion fund, together with an EU strategy for Roma inclusion and a Roma unit within the European Commission.
This will ensure proper management of the EU Roma inclusion policies.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, we need democratic revolution.
That is clear from this process, which has luckily gained momentum with what is presently the G20, because more may join; one could even imagine a G3.
How would it be if the Council helped in establishing a democratic control mechanism, especially given its tradition of consensus?
It need not be a world parliament straight away, but what is being promoted needs democratic scrutiny by elected parliamentarians within a far bigger forum than the European Parliament.
I should also like to specifically point out that the question of systemic risks must be approached at its core.
With reference in particular to the tiresome situation we keep finding ourselves in, starting back in 1998, with LTCM, Hypo Real Estate and, of course, Lehman, and the knock-on effects, rules should emerge from this that make it impossible to end up with the basic problem of 'too big to fail'.
This can, of course, be done through cartel legislation, but it is certainly also a fundamental global question.
As far as a global transaction tax is concerned, the Tobin tax group was set up here in the European Parliament back in 1999.
It is good that there has been progress here.
As far as the supervisory package is concerned, we urgently need to act on a European scale and not to allow ourselves to be held back by those who want the wrong Europe.
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (HU) Thank you, Mr President.
Commissioner, the European demographical situation makes it necessary to reorganise pension systems and raise the age limit, and we are hearing more and more about controlled immigration instead of realising the hidden potential of our own over-50s.
Well organised adult education enables experts who have worked for several decades to refresh their knowledge and adapt to the changed circumstances.
It also enables adults who are excluded from the labour market but not of retirement age to be engaged and undertake work, through retraining, language, IT and other professional training.
This function of adult education is particularly topical in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, where the employment indices fall well behind the average for the EU-15.
In addition to its bearing on the labour market, adult education also has a third, social and personal dimension, since Internet language courses, dancing classes or cookery courses organised for elderly people contribute to improving their quality of life and to their positive frame of mind.
There are two things that I consider to be particularly important for effective adult education: on the one hand, improvements to information and access, the presentation of successful projects and the sharing of experiences with those concerned.
Let us not forget that a tiny proportion of elderly people in the new Member States use the Internet, and we must use conservative, traditional methods that they can access.
A prominent role in this falls to local governments, who have detailed knowledge of the local conditions and needs.
On the other hand, assessing needs is an important task, that is to say, Member States should reach agreement with economic players, businesses and employers when designing their adult education programmes.
The economic needs of the country in question must be taken into account so that the amount spent on adult education is not money needlessly squandered, but bears demonstrable value to the individual, to society and to the economy.
I would like to congratulate Mrs Pack on her important and timely report.
Thank you for your attention.
<D>
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this joint motion for a resolution on press freedom in Kenya.
A year ago, like many others, I was dismayed and disappointed that, after flawed presidential elections in Kenya, street demonstrations led to riots and ethnic clashes that spread across the country, killing more than a thousand people and leaving another 350 000 people homeless.
Those responsible for the post-election violence a year ago must be brought to justice and a period of reconciliation and tolerance is now essential for Kenya.
In this context, it is very bad news that, on Friday 2 January 2009, President Kibaki signed the Kenya Communications (Amendment) Bill 2008, which amends the Kenya Communications Act of 1998.
This bill flies in the face of press freedom and disregards international conventions signed up to by the Kenyan Government.
Two sections effectively introduce direct media censorship by the Government.
Section 88 gives the Information Minister considerable powers to raid and dismantle broadcasting equipment from a media house that is deemed to be a threat to national security.
Section 46 gives the state the power to regulate contents to be aired and published by both electronic and print media.
Within Kenya, the bill has been opposed by journalists, by Prime Minister Odinga and by the ODM, and its passing highlights a serious lack of consultation within the current grand coalition.
I regret the passing of this bill and urge that any revision of the media law takes account of the many, many reservations expressed.
<D>
Mr President, Prime Minister, Chairmen of the committees, ladies and gentlemen, I am sure that I am echoing the views of the vast majority of this Chamber in saying that, 10 years after its launch, I, as a European, am proud of the success of the euro.
I would like to congratulate Parliament on its initiative to commemorate the 10th anniversary of our single currency here, in this Plenary Chamber of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.
The euro and Economic and Monetary Union have undeniably been a success.
Over these 10 years, the euro has brought many benefits to all its members and continues to do so today amid a deep economic and financial crisis.
Within the short period of a decade, the euro has earned a well-deserved reputation for strength and stability.
The euro is the second of the world's currencies and, thanks to its role in the international economy, is already comparable in some respects to the dollar as an instrument of commerce and means of payment in international finance.
Above all, though, the euro is part of the daily life of nearly 330 million people in 16 countries of the European Union.
We all carry in our wallets this symbol of a shared European identity: because the euro, as well as being a currency, is a central element of our European project, reminding us in a tangible way of the benefits of the integration process that began over half a century ago.
The euro has given us low inflation and low interest rates, thanks to a macroeconomic framework directed at stability.
The euro has provided a clear boost to trade and investment among its Member States.
The euro has also facilitated the creation of 16 million jobs over the last 10 years in the euro area, three times the corresponding figure from the previous decade.
The euro has encouraged financial integration and the development of the single market; it has protected the members of the euro area from external disruption; and it has been and continues to be a pole of stability, not just for the European economy, but also for the global economy.
The crisis is, without a doubt, a touchstone for the euro.
However, those who think that the Economic and Monetary Union is not ready to face the consequences of this crisis are quite mistaken.
On the contrary, if the single currency did not exist, the adverse effects of the crisis would be much greater.
Many Member States would now be facing great volatility in their exchange rates and, possibly, might even be suffering speculative attacks on their currencies.
The spread of their public debt securities would be much greater than currently, and their margins for combating the crisis through fiscal stimuli would be narrower.
The Stability and Growth Pact, reformed in 2005, has encouraged governments to sort out their public accounts, leading in 2007 to the lowest budget deficit for 25 years, which is now enabling them to face the crisis in a better situation.
Throughout this crisis, the actions of the European Central Bank have done nothing but reinforce the solid reputation that it had already earned in the early years of Economic and Monetary Union.
By decisively adopting the necessary measures and taking the lead in cooperating with the other central banks in industrialised countries, the European Central Bank has served as our guide throughout this period and has substantially contributed to preventing huge financial collapse.
The economic situation is not as we would have hoped as we celebrate this anniversary, but events are highlighting more than ever the advantages of Economic and Monetary Union.
For those countries which have not yet joined, the euro area is an increasingly attractive option, as demonstrated last week in Bratislava when we welcomed Slovakia as the newest - the 16th - member of the euro family.
The European Commission and Parliament must continue working with Member States, the Eurogroup, the European Central Bank and the international community in order to place our economies on the path to the sustainable resumption of growth.
In this regard, the Commission's recommendations in the report that we submitted a few months ago on the first 10 years of Economic and Monetary Union, which was recently debated in this Chamber, are as valid or even more valid today than they were last spring.
Increased budgetary vigilance, its extension to other macroeconomic aspects, the link between macroeconomic policies and structural reform, the external image of the euro and improved governance of the Economic and Monetary Union are, and must continue to be, the core themes on which to base the euro's second decade, with at least as many successes as this first one.
Mr President, I would like to conclude by paying tribute to the vision and ambition of the founding fathers of the euro, whose imagination and resolute action bequeathed to us a currency of which all Europeans can be proud.
We must safeguard the foundations of this success.
The crisis has opened up a new chapter for the global economy, in which the Economic and Monetary Union must continue to play a relevant role in serving the common interests and ambitions of all Europeans.
<D>
President-in-Office of the Council. - I want to thank Mr Burke for his question concerning the southern corridor plans and the meetings during the upcoming Czech Presidency.
We will ensure that these are the three priorities - energy, external relations and the economy - which are fully integrated and interconnected and focus on the concrete initiative; this is one of them.
It will in particular concentrate on the objective of ensuring reliable supplies of energy through the development of a range of energy relationships with third countries and regions and by working towards greater diversification of energy resources, as well as the transit routes.
The Presidency intends to take this work forward on the basis of the elements contained in the Commission communication on the Second Strategic Energy Review.
The Council is expected to adopt a conclusion on this communication in February and energy security will be of particular focus in the spring 2009 European Council.
As part of its work, a large number of meetings with third countries or third-country organisations are planned.
These meetings will deal either exclusively with energy-related themes or will cover energy among the other issues.
As regards the specific discussion on energy strategic corridors to which the honourable Member refers, the Presidency is organising the following meetings.
The most important are, first, the international investment conference on the Ukrainian gas transit network, which will take place in Brussels on 23 March 2009.
Second, the so-called Southern Corridor Summit meeting, which we plan to organise together with the Eastern Partnership event; that will take place in Prague in early May.
The aim of that meeting is to launch a mutually beneficial dialogue between the EU and both the transit and producing countries from the Caspian region.
This should lead to a greater diversification of energy supply routes, suppliers and sources, and will thus strengthen the energy security of the EU.
One of the specific purposes is to promote the Nabucco project.
The issue of the strategic energy corridor is also likely to be addressed during the meeting of the EU-Russia Permanent Partnership Council on Energy, which will also be organised under the Czech Presidency, probably in May, just to create a run-up to the summit meeting between the EU and Russia, which we are planning for 22 May 2009.
So the importance of the strategic energy corridors referred to by the honourable Members has been clearly underlined by the Ukrainian-Russian gas dispute in early January.
The Council, at its extraordinary session of 12 January 2009, which was devoted to this subject, adopted conclusions outlining a number of measures to be taken in the short, medium and long term.
So the Presidency will work to ensure that appropriate and concrete follow-up is given to these measures as a part of the high priority it attaches to the issue of energy security.
<D>
I have just voted in favour of the Commission Work Programme for 2011, but with reservations.
It no longer contains the promised communication from the Directorate General for Enterprise and Industry (DG ENTERPRISE) on corporate social responsibility (CSR).
Instead the Internal Market and Services Directorate General (DG MARKT) has started an online consultation on the disclosure of non-financial information by companies.
This is alarming and suggests a possible change in policy.
The DG MARKT is no longer asking whether EU regulation is needed in the field of CSR, but instead how it should be structured.
The DG ENTERPRISE held several transparency workshops from which it emerged that almost all employers and unions were strongly opposed to mandatory CSR.
Since 2006, the DG ENTERPRISE has been in overall control, as CSR initiatives represent contributions to a sustainable society by companies as part of their business activities.
They are the result of entrepreneurial commitment and are based on individual initiative and responsibility.
There is a consensus about this basic concept which has been developed over a number of years in numerous multi-stakeholder forums.
The DG ENTERPRISE has the institutional knowledge used to exercise control over these processes.
I am calling on the Commission to leave the responsibility for managing and structuring CSR with the DG ENTERPRISE.
I continue to oppose the idea of mandatory CSR reporting, as it will lead to new red tape and discourage companies from making additional voluntary commitments.
<D>
Mr President, I do not propose to put pressure on the Czech senators or the Irish people in the debate this afternoon, so I am going to increase pressure upon the Commission - and especially upon the President.
It is expected that the European Council is to nominate President Barroso for a second term and, in such circumstances, we would expect to see and to discuss a manifesto from President Barroso.
Will he publish such a programme, and what will it contain?
Centrally and surely, it should draw conclusions from the financial turmoil and the economic crash, especially as we approach the budgetary review before 2012.
We have to change the size and the shape of the budget so that it more squarely responds to our top political priorities.
The new Commission should make the case for a transfer of spending from national to European level in the interests of cost efficiency and added value.
It should include, as an important objective, an expansion in the size of the eurozone and support a far stronger Eurogroup, committed to tighter fiscal discipline and a common economic policy, not simply the poorly-coordinated national macroeconomic policies that we have at present.
And, yes, it should include a proposal for the raising of Eurobonds, plus greater federal supervision for the financial sector and a proper fiscal stimulus, accompanied by a proper trade stimulus triggered by the reopening of the Doha trade negotiations.
<D>
Mr President, let me thank all those who have spoken on this particularly sensitive subject and allow me to make some comments.
Mr Maaten and others spoke about the European donor card, which we have adopted as an addition to what is provided in Member States.
Mr Maaten quoted some correct figures: 80% of citizens surveyed were in favour, but only 12% have a donor card.
However, another statistic should give us cause for concern: of those who had a donor card when the time came for them to become donors, 50% did not donate their organs because their families refused.
There are thus problems that we cannot be sure will be solved with a European donor card.
As for the point raised by Mr Matsakis about 'presumed consent', this is a matter for the Member States.
According to my fellow Member who spoke about Scotland, presumed consent solves the problem.
It is up to the Member States to decide whether to adopt such a measure.
We should not forget the principle of subsidiarity.
In this case, we must see which systems have succeeded, so that we can exchange experience and procedures, as in the case of Spain, to which Mrs Sornosa Martínez has referred.
Why do we not have in different hospitals coordinators, specialised doctors and nurses, able to recognise potential donors so that transplants can go ahead and we can thus increase the availability of organs?
Mrs Auken, who is not here at the moment, has said that we will never be able to fill the shortfall in organ donation.
As a doctor and a scientist, my answer is that perhaps I will not live to see the day, or future generations will, but in the decades to come we will be able to make the organ we want from the cells of the individual who needs it, maybe from his skin or from elsewhere.
Commissioner, you spoke about umbilical cord blood cells and about their storage.
Now let me point out that we really must not let them fall into the hands of private firms operating for profit.
In my country, Cyprus, the Karaiskakio Foundation provides this service free of charge.
There are also three private firms charging parents to store umbilical cord blood cells.
These cells are also precursor and stem cells; they are very valuable, as you know.
What can I say about the reference made to trade?
My fellow Member referred to the report by Carla Del Ponte.
I expected to see this report earlier, to be honest.
Naturally, it is yet more proof that trafficking is also taking place in the enlarged Europe.
I thank all of you once again.
I think that the time has now come for us as European citizens to take action.
We must mobilise, coordinate, raise the awareness of those around us and set a good example: we must become organ donors ourselves.
<D>
Madam President, across Europe, every Member State is struggling with runaway energy prices.
Therefore seeing waste as potentially important fuel is, I believe, both sensible and necessary.
It is surely a win-win situation - both dealing with our massive stockpiles of waste and providing an alternative energy supply source, particularly as we face an energy crisis and increasing dependence upon insecure foreign supplies of oil.
I therefore do not therefore understand the reticence of some in facing up to the obvious advantage of promoting energy from waste.
I fear some colleagues feel so precious about their recycling and anti-incineration dogmas that they would sacrifice the opportunity of heat and power from waste.
In that, I have to say, I believe they are profoundly mistaken.
On a related note, could I say that I very strongly favour maximising the definition of 'recovery' under the Directive, making it indisputably clear that energy from waste represents recovery, not disposal, of waste.
We should particularly apply that to our agricultural sector, where there is much opportunity in that regard.
<D>
President of the Commission. - Yes, you are right.
Firstly, we have legislation.
We have binding new standards and requirements applicable to offshore drilling and oil production facilities as regards equipment standards, worker safety, environmental sustainability, emergency prevention and preparedness.
In addition, the Member States have enacted extensive national legislation to maintain a high level of safety of offshore operations in Europe.
Secondly, we have an information response system ready to fight disasters caused by oil spills from tankers or drilling and production facilities.
This system includes a set of tools managed by the European Maritime Agency, focusing on prevention of pollution and response to pollution.
Thirdly, there is a Community civil protection mechanism that can give a response to any major crisis situation.
Regarding the concrete point you made on liability, most European legislation on safety and the environment does not target particular industries, but we can see that this legislation is applicable to all relevant economic sectors.
EU legislation sets minimum safety standards which individual Member States must strive to meet through their legislation.
This is in line with the principle of subsidiarity.
<D>
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to thank the Members who contributed to the drafting of this resolution.
I would like to stress that this is supported by all the political groups.
Why such unanimity?
No doubt because it reflects our dissatisfaction with the attitude and approach of the Commission, which stems from a denial of democracy that the European Parliament has faced on this dossier for several weeks now.
The Commission's determination to disregard the opinion of MEPs and experts on the issue of importing chlorinated chicken is truly appalling.
Yes, Mr Verheugen is in charge of negotiating with his US counterpart to promote trade between our two regions, but can he do it by sacrificing European health standards?
How can the Commission have given the go-ahead for this kind of project, merely proposing compulsory labelling and a review of the provisions in 2 years' time etc.?
Can the Commission explain why, after acknowledging that it lacked information about these substances, it is not adopting a precautionary approach?
The absence of references to the conclusions of the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is also curious, since a few weeks ago it revealed an increase in contamination and infection from salmonella, listeria and other bacteria.
Why should we import a method which has not already been tried and tested?
Another important point to remember is that the implementation of European food safety legislation required years of work and collaboration with industry professionals, who agreed to invest in order to meet the expectations of European citizens.
This approach, which involves the entire food chain, is the most sustainable way of reducing the level of pathogens.
This was the choice we made, and do you really think that a relationship of trust and a strong and reliable partnership can be built by failing to reaffirm our own principles and values to our US partners?
I have one more question: would the imported products be subject to the same rules as European poultry?
Finally, I will finish by pointing out that this decision is all the more incomprehensible as the European Commission has decided to counterattack the WTO over the decision of its Dispute Settlement Body on hormone-treated beef.
I find that there is enormous confusion and misunderstanding among consumers faced with this diametrically opposed position.
It really calls into question the political line taken by the European Commission on food health and safety.
The European Council will shortly issue an opinion on the Commission's proposal.
We ask it to take into account the position of Parliament and the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health: to put health before trade.
<D>
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (NL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I will limit my contribution to the Commission's discharge and that of Parliament.
With regard to the Commission's discharge, we are faced with problems that have been sufficiently explained, particularly by the rapporteurs: the fact that the Court of Auditors reported a great many problems in relation to the structural funds, that in fact 12% should not have been paid out (EUR 4 billion, which is an enormous amount) and, with regard to external relations, the fact that, among other things, cooperation with the United Nations is going poorly and awkwardly.
These are the problems that we have discussed.
This was a significant discharge, because it is the last discharge before the elections.
We have another discharge next year, but this will be held during a pre-election phase.
It was therefore a significant discharge and we have had to exact dialogue.
I am delighted that we did this in a highly constructive manner, across the groups.
The fact that we have twice organised a hearing with Commissioners Špidla and Hübner and the fact that we - Mr Jørgensen, Mr Mulder, Mrs Gräßle and I - have been able to exact information from the Commission by means of a joint letter, has led to an excellent result.
I sincerely hope that we can achieve a better result next year.
With regard to Parliament, I would like to concentrate on two major problems.
In relation to the assistants' statute, we have the internal audit, conducted by the internal auditor.
I must commend him on this; it is an excellent document.
I still do not understand, Mr President, why you and the Bureau have not published this audit.
After all, this is currently surrounded by secrecy and this is not necessary, because we, as Parliament, have always requested that this audit be carried out and that an inquiry be conducted into how the secretariat allowances are managed.
I now firmly believe that we must implement that statute.
I have submitted a number of other amendments to reinforce Mr Pomés Ruiz's existing text.
This must take place in dialogue with the Commission, but also in dialogue with the Council in particular, because if, in the near future, we approach the Council with a problem that it fails to follow up on, then we are not where we need to be.
This must therefore be done in dialogue with the Commission and with the Council.
One final item that I would like to mention is that the voluntary pension fund causes me a great deal of concern.
Firstly, the actuarial shortfall is continuing to increase, and secondly, I would also like the list of participants in that voluntary pension fund to finally be published.
<D>
Vice-President of the Commission. - (DE) Mr President, honourable Members, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Csibi, for his outstanding work on this proposal and by saying how very pleased I am that his work has made agreement possible at first reading.
The content of the proposal - from a purely legalistic point of view - is limited.
It essentially consists of extending the scope of the existing Eco-design Directive beyond the energy-using products that it currently covers to include all energy-relevant products.
From a political point of view, though, this change is of the utmost significance.
It represents an important step on the road towards the third industrial revolution in Europe, to the transformation of our European national economies into national economies with low-CO2 production.
I have a vision of how the European product of the future will look.
The European product of the future, bearing a 'Made in Europe' label, will be the most innovative, safest and also the most energy and resource-efficient product around.
I am convinced that a leading role for Europe in energy efficiency and in the thrifty use of resources will not only benefit the environment, but also our employment figures.
Environmentally-friendly products and environmentally-friendly processes are currently booming economically, even in this crisis, and this is set to continue.
To my mind, this directive is a good example of integrated product politics.
It has already proved its worth and we are seeing good results when it comes to energy-using products.
The directive provides a framework for the laying down of eco-design requirements that take account of the actual environmental impact of a product throughout its entire life cycle.
As Mr Csibi has already said, the directive paves the way for a voluntary initiative by industry.
It limits officially specified requirements to those products in which a significant saving potential could be realised in an economically viable way.
The directive currently in force is already making an important contribution to achieving the European reduction targets, through the abolition of light bulbs, boilers and numerous other energy-inefficient consumer products.
Expanding the scope of the directive to cover all energy-related products brings with it an enormous potential for further reducing energy consumption and thereby CO2 emissions.
To recap, every product that is relevant to the consumption of energy now falls within the scope of the directive.
This therefore also includes those products that do not consume energy directly when used, but which influence energy consumption indirectly.
So, for example, requirements can now be laid down for products that use water and for windows.
To give just one example: simply increasing the proportion of windows with double-glazing could give rise to an additional 30% of energy savings by 2020.
That is the equivalent of a saving of 55 000 gigawatt hours, which represents a saving of 27 megatonnes of CO2, or the output of two to three nuclear power stations.
That shows the enormous impact that the apparent innocuousness of such changes can conceal.
The Commission intends to continue its on-going work on the approximately 25 implementation measures for the eco-design directive that were set out in its working plan for the 2009-2011 period.
In addition, after consulting the Eco-design Consultation Forum pursuant to Article 16 of the directive, it will lay down what products are to be included in the second working plan by 21 October 2011.
By 2012 the Commission will also review, pursuant to Article 21, whether it would be appropriate to extend the scope of the directive to products that are not relevant to energy consumption but that do have a bearing on resource conservation.
As agreed in the negotiations that led to agreement at first reading, the Commission is issuing a statement.
Parliament is aware of the statement.
I will pass it on to the Bureau after this sitting.
Due to the quick adoption of the proposal at first reading, the Commission can now implement its sustainable industrial policy and get straight to work on coming up with other specific steps to save energy and reduce CO2 emissions.
Let me conclude by observing that the close cooperation between Parliament, the Council and the Commission sped up the negotiations.
I am very pleased to be able to tell you that the Commission feels able to support all of the amendments put forward by the rapporteur, Mr Csibi.
Thank you.

The regulation amending the Common Consular Instructions on visas defines the legal framework required to introduce biometric identifiers into the Visa Information System, VIS, as well as the arrangements for receiving and processing visa applications.
This regulation offers the possibility of cooperation with an external service provider for collecting visa applications.
I think that the reasons why a free rein has been given to cooperate with external suppliers are unjustified and create the risk of visa trafficking.
Although the regulation stipulates that Member States remain as operators and external service providers are people empowered by the operator, I believe that a question mark has been raised over the protection of private individuals in terms of processing and circulating their biometric data.
The right to levy a service charge, apart from the normal visa charge, will create differences between Member States regarding the cost of a visa.
I am absolutely convinced that this will also create differences between Member States in terms of the number of visa applications.
I would like to draw the attention of Member States which use 'outsourcing' as a way to arrange the receipt and processing of visa applications to bear in mind this danger and review the legal framework so that it minimises the possibility of external suppliers collecting visa applications.
<D>
(LT) Ten years ago, the European Union agreed on a Code of Conduct on Arms Exports.
Unfortunately, it is not being implemented.
The Council, meeting behind closed doors, is unable to adopt a common position.
It would be very important to know which countries are blocking it, while allowing themselves to make huge profits from people's blood and tears.
In March, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on this issue.
However, as we speak, weapons made in European Union countries flow by a growing illegal stream to conflict zones and fall into the hands of criminals.
It is a paradox that those weapons also go to countries to which the EU provides enormous support for development.
The presidency countries of the Council of Europe - France and maybe also the Czech Republic to complete it - must do everything possible to approve the Code of Conduct on Arms Exports, to prevent the irresponsible transfer of EU arms to criminals.
If this fails, the parties hindering it must be identified.
<D>
Member of the Commission - The high-speed internet is the internet of the future, and we would not like this internet to be available only to some.
This is why the information society for all is one of the Lisbon Strategy postulates for open and competitive markets.
Because our regulatory instruments today, even before the reform, enable this open approach to the e-communications framework - it is also bolstered by general competition rules - this has made markets too open to competition, which in turn has driven the roll-out of broadband access networks in Europe.
I am worried that in some countries it worked well - these are the countries where competition is functioning well, where you have penetration rates of up to 37%, even 40% - whereas in some other countries the penetration rates are very low.
I would like to get rid of this variation.
I would like to bring those who are in the very low category up the ladder.
This is why the Commission proposes, as part of the reform, to enable the Commission to oversee the regulatory remedies put in place by national regulatory authorities, backed up by the possibility of the national regulatory authorities imposing functional separation if they think it necessary in order to open the markets.
In parallel, the Commission deals with anti-competitive behaviour as a priority.
For instance, in 2003 we fined France Télécom and Deutsche Telekom for abusive behaviour in the broadband markets and, most recently, on 4 July 2007 the Commission fined Telefónica for having abused its dominant position by margin squeeze in the Spanish broadband market.
I would also like to say that a communication was issued in March 2006 on bridging the broadband gap.
I really believe that we need broadband for all, and this is why I believe we need to have national broadband strategies which reflect regional and local needs.
Moving to the question raised about transparency, the Commission is about to launch a web portal that should start to operate around May-June 2008 on the question of broadband and the citizens.
Last but not least, the Commission has a favourable view regarding the use of public funds, including EU funds - Structural Funds - to extend broadband in areas where commercial deployment is inadequate.
Several such projects have already been established.
We also support the development of information societies through regional policy.
A provisional estimate puts the investment at about EUR 15 billion, which is 4.4% of the total spending for the period 2007-2013, and of this figure EUR 2.2 billion is expected to be spent on broadband infrastructures.
Through these combined efforts we hope that the penetration figures of today - where we have, incidentally, four world leaders in broadband penetration - will make many more countries leaders in the world and particularly in Europe.
<D>
Mr President, in this report we do have reference to the mobilisation of the EU solidarity fund, which we talked about slightly earlier.
And part of my region did benefit, or will benefit, from that money, especially in North Lincolnshire, where we suffered huge flooding.
But I do wonder whether the people of Lincolnshire would view this as a good use of money.
We now pay so much money to the European Union and we then have to beg for money back when we have a need ourselves.
For every GBP 2 we get back, we have put GBP 5 into this pot in the first place.
I do wonder whether we could spend that money better.
I also have some major concerns, as I have stated before in explanations of vote, about how we do these draft amending budgets.
Huge sums of money are transferred between different budget lines and very, very few people have oversight over this.
Today, we are just transferring a couple of million euros here for Galileo and a couple of million euros there, but in the past it has been hundreds of millions of euros.
I do wonder whether that is the right parliamentary process to give us oversight over European taxpayers' money.
<D>
President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, thank you again for raising this very important issue.
I think there is general agreement that the Services Directive is very important and that it is really urgent that we try to implement it as soon as possible.
The Swedish Presidency is doing its utmost, as have earlier presidencies, to make sure that this goes smoothly and quickly.
We have had several discussions in different Council formations.
We have had seminars and discussions on it, and it has been placed on the agenda to encourage real progress on this issue.
However, almost two months remain, and the answer to the question of who is lagging behind may change.
There is still time.
Our aim is clear - and I know that it is the Commission's aim as well - and it is that all countries should have implemented the directive by 28 December 2009.
There might be some delays.
We deplore that, of course, but I know that all countries are working as quickly and swiftly as possible.
A question was asked about how the contact points would function.
Well, they do not exist yet, but the aim is for them to function in a user-friendly and effective way and to contain all the relevant information that is needed, both by the service suppliers and by consumers.
Member States have collaborated with the Commission to supply an information leaflet, available in all languages, to facilitate access for citizens and consumers to the relevant information.
Many Member States are also making their own efforts in order to spread information about the directive.
There is also an agreement to have a common logo to make it easier for users to navigate between the different websites and the contact points.
Some Member States - although it is not compulsory - will provide information on working rights and labour laws at their contact points.
The Services Directive does not cover labour law and the posting of workers is excluded from it.
The question put to me by my Swedish colleagues is a Swedish issue.
We are looking into that, and it is a little outside this debate.
We will be happy to come back to it in a more national context.
The Services Directive is important.
It will make life easier for service providers, it will facilitate free movement and will be beneficial for investment, for growth and jobs and it will be very good for the citizens.
The citizens look to us to ensure that it is in place as soon as possible because it will facilitate their life.
It is our responsibility to make sure that we do our utmost to see this happen.
I would like to thank Parliament again, not only for its contribution in voting on and adopting the Services Directive, but also for acting as a watchdog and continuing to push the Council and the Commission to do what we can in order for it to come into place.
But there is still some time remaining and possibly we will come back to this debate next year, under the Spanish Presidency.
The Commission will still be watching this very closely.
<D>
(RO) The Package Travel Directive encompasses transport and accommodation services, along with other related services provided through package holidays.
It also sets out consumers' rights and the responsibilities of distributors and tourism service providers.
The 1990 directive fails to take into account new trends, such as buying package holidays and making payments via the Internet.
The rise in the level of Internet use and the emergence of low-cost operators have made 23% of European tourists and 20% of European households buy customised package holidays via specialist websites.
The directive must therefore be revised to include within its remit suppliers of 'dynamic' package holidays as well.
Consumers must be fully informed about their rights and about how these rights are guaranteed by each of the offerings available, both for the complete package holiday and each component individually.
I also feel that it is important that websites which offer travel services are accredited.
This will help guarantee that the identity of the tourism service provider can be recognised and, by extension, there will be a clear assumption of responsibility for the information and services provided.
The study published by the Commission in January 2009 on package holidays organised at the customer's request, known as 'dynamic packages', indicates that the proportion of package holidays purchased online rose by 12% in 2009, even though their value only accounts for 25% of the total value of tourism services sold.
66% of the transactions made online involve direct purchases via the websites of airline operators, travel agents or via specialist websites offering last-minute travel deals.
Tourists prefer dynamic packages because they offer greater flexibility, lower prices compared to traditional package holidays and a higher quality of service, or because they cannot find traditional package holidays to meet their requirements.
In addition, the dynamic package holidays purchased can only be paid for using online payment methods.
However, approximately 70% of the complaints received last year by the European Consumer Centres Network related to tourism services and were due to the incorrect and incomplete provision of information prior to and during the trip, the provision of services falling below the standards advertised, flight cancellations or delays, and even to failure to provide the services purchased.
I think therefore that it is important and necessary to review this directive.
Thank you.
<D>
Protection of the rights of human rights defenders is something that in my view cannot be subject to any kind of divisions based on political likes or dislikes.
We in this House tend all too often to pass very harsh judgment on those with whom we do not share certain political ideals and to defend too vigorously those whom we regard as allies.
I must stress that, in terms of human rights, the issue has to be addressed from a universal point of view.
The risk we are running today is also present in the resolution on Nicaragua that has been tabled by certain political groups.
We must bear the context in mind.
This context clearly shows us a country in a poverty situation, which needs to be tackled urgently with drastic structural measures.
It seems to me that the current government of Nicaragua is doing many of the things that need doing in order to address this problem.
It is also important to remember, however, that the fight against poverty cannot be compatible with the persecution and harassment of people who, for one reason or another, disagree with the official line.
A true democracy is one that allows disagreement, debate and freedom of expression.
Certain situations have taken place recently in Nicaragua that deserve to be highlighted.
Some of them are positive, like the abolition in July of Article 204 of the Criminal Law, which criminalised homosexuality.
As Vice-President of the Intergroup on LGBT rights at the European Parliament, I am delighted at that.
Others, however, are negative and deeply worrying, such as the numerous examples that we have had cause to regret in connection with the worsening situation of women.
In particular, there has been persecution of women who uphold their sexual and reproductive rights, inter alia by supporting a young rape victim by helping her have an abortion to save her life.
This is something that we must never lose sight of and which must be taken into account in the framework of the current negotiations to conclude an association agreement.
Nevertheless, I also call on the Commission to consult with Parliament before coming to any decision on this matter.
<D>
- (FR) Madam President, as my fellow Members have reminded us, this storm has exacted a heavy toll.
There are victims in France and Spain and this evening we think of them and their families.
200 000 hectares of forest have been destroyed in the south west of France.
In fact, this storm has ravaged 60% of the Landes forest.
1.7 million homes were without electricity at the height of the storm, and 3 200 of them in the Landes are still without electricity.
Thousands had their phone lines cut and also their water supply disrupted.
Many roads are still impassable due to obstacles such as fallen trees, power lines, floods or landslips.
The services are endeavouring to restore everything as quickly as possible.
While I am pleased that the French Government has formally committed itself to submitting an application so that the areas of France affected can benefit from this fund, I deplore the fact that the French Presidency did not deem it necessary to press for a review of this fund.
This fund, as you, Commissioner, and my fellow Members have said, is still blocked by the Council of Ministers.
As far as Parliament is concerned, it is about covering any major natural disaster which causes serious harm to the population and the environment, like floods, fires and droughts.
However, we are going further by also including man-made phenomena, like catastrophes caused by terrorist attacks.
Our Parliament has also declared itself in favour of lowering the threshold for assistance.
Now, if we question whether this Solidarity Fund is working for the affected regions, we can see that we risk being below the damage threshold.
Now, this is a situation where, ultimately, several countries are affected.
Therefore, I think that this threshold should also be reviewed to show that European solidarity really can exist.
As you have said, Commissioner, and my fellow Members have underlined, this sort of event will be repeated due to the results of climate change.
The Commission has already announced a Communication on adapting to climate change.
It is important from now on for this Solidarity Fund to be a genuine European instrument for protecting citizens.
It is time Europe showed that, in tragic situations, it is there to protect its citizens.
<D>
in writing. - I am very pleased that the health of our children is being tackled at European level.
Obesity amongst children is a growing concern in Europe, and even more so in the UK where almost 25% of the population is obese and 10% of children are overweight.
This issue is a serious concern to many of my constituents and I welcome an initiative to tackle it.
Addressing eating habits in childhood is key to preventing obesity later on in life, and the consumption of fruit and vegetables is proven to reduce the rate of obesity and cardio-vascular diseases.
In the UK, the appeal of convenience food is leading to the development of bad eating habits, which in turn cost our health service an annual GBP 6 billion.
It is clear, then, that supporting this initiative also makes good economic sense.
This is why I voted in favour of this report and I hope that Member States will make effective use of the funds to fight what is becoming a real problem for our children.
<D>
Mr President, Commissioner, it was exactly a year ago today that we witnessed the collapse of the financial institution Lehman Brothers.
Then, according to the experts, we were on the verge of a financial collapse, and we were on the threshold of another great depression.
The financial crisis intensified and extended to the real economy, and we have lived through a period in which we have had negative economic growth and job losses.
However, developed countries are beginning to come out of the crisis.
France and Germany have done so, for example, and the Commission presented its economic forecasts today, which show that in the second half of the year, the European Union will come out of the recession.
However, the less developed countries are in the midst of the crisis and will continue to be there for a long time.
They did not cause the crisis, but they are suffering the consequences of it more than anyone.
They are suffering the consequences with less growth, faster growing unemployment, less direct investment, less foreign credit, less money sent back by emigrants, less official development aid and, of course, more trade restrictions.
We have lived through a period during which our stability has declined and our comfortable situation has declined in a limited time, but they are in danger of losing a decade in the fight against poverty, and a decade means that an entire generation is lost.
We can do a great deal for them on many aspects, and I would like to specifically focus on confronting protectionism.
Last week, the Commission presented its fourth report on trade restriction measures, which shows that many countries are adopting new restrictive measures, which is disastrous for developing countries.
Also, many developed countries will not fulfil their commitments to official development aid at the very time when we need fresh resources more than ever to confront the seriousness of the crisis.
I therefore propose that we increase the coordination of this development aid with a broader agreement between donor countries, financial institutions and partners, and manage it more efficiently and transparently so that it does not generate costs and is not a bureaucratic burden.
I urge the Commission, I urge the Commissioner, to implement the plan that it has presented to us, which I am sure Commissioner Almunia will agree with.
<D>
(RO) We have here a very good report, which seems to have said everything.
We thank those who worked on it.
Nevertheless, allow me a reformulation that is not a figure of speech.
Our general goal, as politicians, is to arrange relationships between people in the society, so that we can all live as long as possible keeping harmony between us and nature.
If we accept this goal, we have no demographic problem.
In fact, we are subject to a demographic study only by an unjustified simplification and ignorance of what we are.
There are other indicators measuring the situation of people, as population, and we know them.
They are called human development indexes.
From this point of view, the European Union countries are ranked at the top of the most advanced countries, which is good.
The challenge is not to change the demographic behaviours, but to accept that we need to change our economic and social model.
It is superior to other models, but inadequate.
It lagged behind our own development as people.
There is a gap between our general goal and the organization of the social environment and the economic relations, between declaration and facts.
We say it is necessary to have more children born.
In the meantime, 30% of Europe's children live below the poverty threshold.
We ask women to give birth to children, but single mothers experience the biggest risk of exclusion.
The employment rate has to increase, but social services should not be financed.
We export problems and we want to import solutions, but citizens are not a market.
We have to humanize the economic and social relations if we want to solve this problem.
This is the big challenge.
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, improving the European statistical system is part of the wider task of sound economic governance in the Union, particularly with regard to adjustment of the Stability and Growth Pact.
I share the wish expressed by both the Commission and the Member States to enhance the quality of statistical information.
As I see it, determining what constitutes an excessive deficit depends on the reliability of the data.
Unreliable data puts the entire Stability and Growth Pact in jeopardy.
In return for flexibility in implementation of the pact, which was introduced under the reform adopted by the March 2005 European Council, the necessary figures must be indisputable and verifiable.
Flexibility is important too in the current context of enlargement of the euro zone.
We need to learn the lessons of past experience!
The European Union has already been obliged to review the statistics relating to a Member State's budget deficit and level of debt; now several Member States want to join the euro zone, so the volume of statistical information to be processed will increase, as will the number of parties involved in the discussions.
The proposed improvement to the European statistical system aims to address legitimate concerns that have been raised concerning the validity of the data which Member States supply and the system for checking them.
We need to take care that doubt is not cast over the entire statistical system and over Eurostat's ability to verify the budget data which the Member States provide.
For these reasons I support the reform, which will result firstly in the establishment of a European Advisory Committee on Community Statistical Information Policy and secondly in the creation of a European Statistical Governance Advisory Board - both bodies capable of actively helping to monitor implementation of the code of conduct throughout the entire European statistical system.
I have no hesitation in supporting the proposals made by our two excellent rapporteurs.
<D>
This is indeed a very coherent package.
Following this morning's debate on the support package and on tighter, sounder financial and economic governance, we are now discussing a number of underlying dossiers that are important as regards the commitment required in connection with the EU 2020 strategy.
Parliament wishes to expressly steer these proposals by the Commission and, particularly, the Council; it is unacceptable for the Council to take decisions in June without us having expressly reached agreement on a number of underlying matters.
We are talking about the direction, and also about implementation in the near future.
Take, for example, the flagship projects that will also require our joint support before long.
It is really important, therefore, that we invest enough time in this now.
Well, then, both the Cortés Lastra report and my report on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development concern policy synergy with a view to increasing output, or results, for Europe.
The beauty of it is that we can do better; indeed we must do better.
Our activities are rather fragmented in various fields - if we look at developments in the world, competition and the kind of things we want to tackle.
To summarise: things must be made smarter, greener, more sustainable and more inclusive.
The reports tabled by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs also concern governance and ensuring sufficient financial resources, including for education.
In short, it is my hope that, this afternoon, we shall lay clear foundations for this resolution.
I do not know whether a vote will be held tomorrow, whether a consensus will be achieved on governance.
In any case, however, I anticipate that Parliament will be able to adopt a final position on the EU 2020 strategy in June.
Returning to my report: it is an implementation report.
We have taken a proper look at how things work in the fields of research and development, regional policy and small and medium-sized enterprises, and I wish to thank my fellow Members, including those from the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy - the committee with joint responsibility in accordance with Article 50 - for helping us achieve a good result.
What have we laid down?
1.
In Europe, we have first-class research.
Yet what is lagging behind is the utilisation of this research.
Knowledge is free; it travels around the world, and cannot be kept to oneself.
Although we are very good at investing in research, we are lagging behind in the utilisation of this research, in bringing innovation to the market and, subsequently, keeping high-quality production in this part of the world.
2.
My report notes that we are currently spending one quarter of regional funds on research infrastructure and innovation.
That is a substantial change, a prioritisation that has been working in the current period thanks to Commission initiatives.
Earmarking is among the instruments that have been effective and have also definitely influenced the agenda in the regions, towns and cities.
It leads to a better profile in the knowledge-based economy into which we are evolving, and to greater specialisation.
3.
In my report, together with my fellow Members, I have made a series of proposals for improvements throughout the research/innovation/production chain with a view to greater effectiveness.
We must also realise the importance of the territorial dimension laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon.
We need to focus on a number of areas in order to achieve a large-scale effect; we need the courage to specialise production in a region - incidentally, the principle of specialisation is an old one in the European Union - provided that good links exist for transmitting that knowledge (broadband or traditional infrastructure).
If the Union invests money, there should also be cooperation between the ...

draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality. - (DE) Mr President, it is important to treat the budget in a gender-neutral manner, as we should and must do, from the women's policy point of view.
The aspect of gender is of great importance here and 'gender budgeting' must not be merely empty words, but must be seen to be put into practice.
It is very important that we top up the DAPHNE programme.
Unfortunately, our amendment did not get through and we will now raise it in the Plenary once again.
We Social Democrats support the amendment and the increase of funds for DAPHNE, because it is a relatively small, but very important programme to combat domestic violence.
Then it is also important to provide appropriate financing for the European Institute for Gender Equality, to ensure that it is launched successfully.
It is also important that expenditure for the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue is distributed equally between the sexes.
There are a great many women, especially migrants, who should be given a vital role in this intercultural dialogue.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, discussion of the Erika III maritime safety package is drawing to a close.
This process is more than three years old and, during that time, we have argued strongly for more safety for passengers, oceans, seas and maritime routes.
As a Portuguese and a Madeiran, it is thought that I was especially committed to this project and its main goals: ensuring that Member States comply consistently with their obligations as members of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), adopt that organisation's conventions and fully apply their mandatory provisions.
The negotiation process was difficult.
For Parliament, the Erika III package was always a package and never a collection of cobbled together measures.
At the time of first reading, Parliament adopted some amendments.
These included the obligation for the flag state to ensure that inspectors and investigators have the correct training and to create capacities for assessment, approval and authorisation of ship and equipment building, the obligation for Member States to obtain documentary evidence of ships' compliance with international standards - if a ship is not newly built, the Member State is obliged to liaise with the previous flag state and ask it to pass on the necessary documents and data - and the maintenance of a fleet database, which must include the main technical information on each ship, including infringements of IMO conditions.
At that time, we reached political agreements on six of the eight proposals.
My own proposal and that of Mr Savary remained to be agreed.
We have now reached agreement on how these two proposals also can be included in the final text of the Erika III package.
Thanks to Parliament and its perseverance, to the Slovene and, especially, the French Presidencies - whom I thank - and, finally, to the common will of us all, we can now conclude this third maritime safety package.
It is important to highlight the ratification of international conventions using the national method in this process.
That was a position which I supported out of respect for the various ratification systems in existence in the various Member States.
Whilst waiting for the IMO audit scheme to become mandatory, Member States have to subject their maritime authorities to such an audit and publish the results.
Member States will put in place a quality management system for their maritime authorities, which is certified in accordance with international standards.
Before authorising a ship to fly their respective flag, Member States have to check that it complies with international rules.
Member States have to make sure that ships which fly their flag and have been detained in the context of a port state inspection are brought into conformity with the relevant IMO conventions.
When a Member State's flag appears on the blacklist or the grey list of the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control for two consecutive years, it has to submit a report on the reasons for the poor performance to the Commission.
In parallel with the common position, Member States will confirm in a joint declaration their commitment to ratify the main international conventions on maritime safety before 1 January 2012, apply the IMO Flag State Code and the related audit scheme for maritime authorities, and encourage the IMO to make these two instruments mandatory worldwide.
To conclude, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the adoption of this third maritime safety package is a significant victory in the European legislative process.
The Commission, the Council and the European Parliament have proposed, debated, come to agreement on and accepted a text that improves the lives of citizens and businesses, promotes better security on the seas and oceans and prepares our future.
My participation in this process was a great honour.
When we vote on this package shortly, we will be paying tribute to the victims of all the past or recent maritime tragedies: from the Prestige to the Erika, and from Bolama to Estonia.
We will also be helping to avoid or reduce the consequences of similar events in the future.
<D>
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have already gone on for too long, but, really, this debate was quite fascinating.
I would like to say that we agree on the priorities as they have been expressed by your rapporteurs, and as they have been expressed by Mr Böge, and that it is in fact our wish to cooperate very closely.
I regret that I am unfortunately not speaking as a finance minister, Mr Böge, but, well, in this Presidency, that is how it is, in fact, and I can simply assure this House that we wish to reach an agreement within the scope of this procedure.
I wish to assure you, too, that the Council will demonstrate, within the limits that I mentioned, the constructive attitude that we are in fact aiming for, within the framework of the priorities mentioned - I am addressing the Commission and this House here.
I observed the emphasis that was placed, in particular, on external policy, on communication, and on subjects relating to financial regulation and to the euro.
I noted these various points, as well as the needs of your institution, which have been pointed out, and that we need to single out two elements at the end of this debate.
The first is the discussion on the future of the European budget.
I heard Mrs Guy-Quint and the others, but many of the observations raised need to be debated within the context of the clause for re-examining the financial framework.
It is within this context that the Commission, the European Parliament and the Member States must take a stand and design the future multiannual financial framework.
We had spoken about this with Mr Böge.
Current circumstances have meant that we, as the Presidency, have also focused on other urgent matters.
The second is the issues at stake in the 2009 budgetary procedure.
In this regard, we must work out a realistic and balanced budget and find solutions for financing the food facility - I say this on the record - as this remains an objective that we share.
This is an important political priority for all the Community institutions today and, on this matter, too, we hope to ensure an optimum combination of the various resources.
<D>
author. - (DE) Mr President, I would like to welcome the Commissioner and Minister Borloo very warmly.
We have a number of questions because we feel, quite honestly, that the European Union - and this applies to the Commission and perhaps also to the Council - has devoted too little attention to oil price trends.
Although I have the greatest respect for the Commissioner, I believe that we should be doing more here.
Let me turn, firstly, to rising oil prices.
I have always pointed out, Commissioner, that substantial profits are being made.
What is happening to them?
In reality, they are not being invested in alternative energies, for example, or in other important investment projects; instead, they are being used to buy up shares and pay dividends.
Secondly, as to the falling oil prices which exist to some extent as well, does the Commission have an overview of whether these falling oil prices are being passed on to consumers?
I am afraid that this is not the case, and I would be grateful for an answer from you on this issue too.
Thirdly, I would like to raise the issue of energy poverty, which we have discussed before, also in connection with the reports which we adopted in committee.
There is no reason why the Commission, independently of future legislation, should not bring in a very practical fuel poverty package.
This is not only a measure that the Commission could take; it is also a measure which the individual governments must of course take.
Here too, though, we would like to see more initiatives from the Commission.
That brings me, fourthly, to the issue of external energy policy and the energy supply, and especially gas, of course, which is a topic we have discussed many times.
I hear that you were in Nigeria recently.
It would be interesting to hear what initiatives have been adopted in that context.
We are seeing the Nabucco project drifting, to cite just one example.
The Americans have achieved the PTC pipeline for oil.
Everyone claimed that this was not going to be profitable but it certainly is profitable now, with the surge in oil prices.
They simply said, 'This is what we want and what we need to diversify our energy supply'.
What is Europe doing?
I think Europe's approach has been far too wishy-washy to achieve certain things and I would like to see the Council and Commission being far more robust and resolute in pursuing diversification for Europe, as this is also important for our energy supply.
A particular concern for our group, however, is the issue of energy poverty and what we are doing to address it, for this is still a very serious problem in Europe.
<D>
We can categorically say that Bulgaria itself, or Bulgaria's citizens to be more exact, do not pose a threat, either directly or potentially, to security, order and peace within the Schengen area.
Our country has fulfilled, albeit late, all the technical requirements relating to external border controls.
However, there is a large degree of distrust suggesting that serious disruption may be caused when the control measures are implemented.
This distrust features in the reports from the European Commission on the Cooperation and Verification Mechanism, in the reports from Europol and in a series of statements made by senior representatives of various Member States.
With the unprecedented growth in smuggling activity and the informal economy, with the prevalence of corruption and the inability to cope with organised crime, there is no good reason for us to get angry at the fact that our membership is being blocked by additional obstacles.
The European Parliament must adopt a position on principle, which is that the rules of the game cannot be changed midway.
According to the formal requirements, Bulgaria and Romania are ready for membership of the Schengen area and the European Council must decide in favour of this as soon as possible.
I am counting on Mr Coelho's report being approved by a large majority to give a clear political signal to Member States.
(The sitting was suspended for a few moments)
<D>
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, last week, the Commission submitted its communication on the economic crisis to the Council for its meeting at the end of this month.
The Commission also gave its first assessment of the results of the European economic stimulus package.
The Commission considers the initial results to be good and estimates that recovery action at national and European levels together will have an overall value equivalent to around 3.3% of GDP in the period 2009-2010.
I congratulate the rapporteur on a very creditable report.
In my opinion, the need to coordinate action by the Member States, which it emphasises, is particularly important.
The emergence of tendencies is very worrying.
Member States might make assurances in speeches that they are ready to pull together, but something quite different is evident where the action taken is concerned.
It is extremely important that EU leaders take decisions with reference to what they say and do not give in to protectionist pressures which, in several countries, are unquestionably drastic.
The EU needs to take a new, ambitious step that constitutes a continuation of the Lisbon Strategy.
The EU needs a stimulus package that gives support to new industries as a basis for competitiveness and growth.
With investment in such areas as eco-modernisation, renewable energy sources and information technology, it is possible to establish healthy sectoral change.
A crisis is also an opportunity.
It is an opportunity to reorganise the whole pan-European and global financial architecture.
The crisis is also an opportunity to steer economic growth along an entirely new avenue, based on renewable energy sources and energy efficiency.
The 'New Green Deal', as it is known, must be a basis for recovery and new growth.
Thus, as we create jobs and introduce innovation, we will also be addressing the challenges of climate change.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I would like to reply and answer the oral question on behalf of Commissioner Mandelson, who was not able to attend today because he is in the process of deep bilateral negotiations on the Doha Round.
The US case against European support for Airbus and the European case against US subsidies to Boeing are currently at the WTO Panel stage and the European legal position has been defended.
We are now expecting the interim reports in both cases in the fall or winter.
The next steps will be determined by the outcome of the dispute and by the underlying interests which led to it.
On the question of how this affects the ability of the industry to compete, we would like to say that we see no reason why the pending EU and US litigation in the WTO over support to Airbus and Boeing should affect the ability of European industry to compete fairly and in public procurement competitions with the United States.
Government procurement is about providing the best equipment, at the best value for the taxpayers, in the tanker procurement.
The US Air Force has determined that the plane offered by Northrop Grumman and the EADS is superior to the Boeing and is the best tanker to meet its needs.
The question of support for Airbus is immaterial in this assessment.
The WTO litigation and the procurement have nothing to do with each other.
On the United States Government Accountability Office reactions, we would like to say that the US Air Force's selection of the Northrop Grumman KC-45 remains in force.
There is a misperception that Northrop Grumman and the EADS North America have somehow lost or that the Boeing award has been reversed.
Northrop Grumman and EADS North America remain under contract, albeit under a stop-work order, which places on hold the work under contract.
The US Government Accountability Office reviewed the Air Force's evaluation process, not the capabilities of the aircraft.
There is no requirement or direction from the Accountability Office to recompete the previous contract award.
The Air Force and Department of Defense have indicated that the KC-45 best meets the USAF's requirements.
The Accountability Office has requested the Air Force to respond regarding the steps it will take within 60 days of the 18 June announcement.
In general, the government support for aerospace meets the need that certain developments in the large civil aircraft industry require very high levels of investment.
It is the Commission's view that any government support for aerospace on both sides of the Atlantic has to be balanced, in order to ensure that the conditions of competition are not distorted.
If this is the case, such support can contribute to innovation, increase safety and improve environmental performance and efficiencies in air transportation.
It is in the interests of airlines and consumers, as well as governments, to maintain a high level of healthy competition in the aircraft sector.
On the prospects of the bilateral agreements of 1992, we would like to inform you that, despite several good-faith attempts to solve the dispute amicably over the past years, the differences between the two sides - the US and the EU - have proven too big.
The US has denied there are any subsidies to Boeing while at the same time demanding that the EU put an end to European support to Airbus.
On this basis it has not been possible to establish a fair and balanced basis for a negotiated settlement yet.
On 18 October 2007 Boeing publicly rejected Airbus's offer to explore an amicable solution.
We should also be aware that, with the current pre-electoral atmosphere in the US, it may not be easy at the present time to find a balanced settlement.
We therefore do not expect that this dispute can be resolved in the near future, before the WTO has ruled on both the Airbus and Boeing cases.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the honourable Member of the European Parliament for his interest in and support for this cause, as demonstrated in the oral question and resolution provided to us.
<D>
(SV) Mr President, let me begin by thanking the rapporteurs for their very good work.
I am pleased with the plans to make life harder for employers and private individuals who employ people illegally.
Illegal employment, in domestic work and childcare for example, mostly involves women, often with an immigrant background.
This affects not only the individuals concerned, but also social insurance and finance systems, and competition in the countries in question.
I am also pleased that continued support will be available to combat human trafficking, especially involving women and children, which predominates.
I am grateful for the support given to halving the number of victims within ten years with a view to eliminating the practice completely.
On the other hand, I am disappointed that I did not get support from the Conservative Group in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs in helping women and children to break free and find a new life.
Voting for Amendment 29 offers a new chance to support women and children so that they can remain in the EU or to help them return.
Do this so that women can have a life - after people trafficking.
I am also pleased that we continue to say 'no' to refugee camps outside the EU.
What I would warn against, however, is the labour force of economic migrants that we will get if we do not allow families, partners and children to accompany them.
Then it will be mostly young men who come, which is not a good thing for any society in the EU.
We talk about the EU's borders.
It is important that persons who engage in human trafficking, crime, drugs, arms dealing and money laundering should be kept outside, while at the same time people in need of protection are welcomed into a humane EU.
They are the backbone of the EU and cannot be excluded from the EU's common future.
Migration will be important, not just for us who live here now, but also for future generations, and we must achieve both global prosperity and our own prosperity.
<D>
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, Belarus was going to be immune to the worldwide financial crisis.
This overconfident prognosis is now costing Mr Lukashenko dearly at the beginning of 2009.
His government is in critical financial trouble.
Minsk has been knocking on the door of the IMF, Moscow and even Washington for billions in credit.
The IMF's condition was the devaluation of the Belarusian rouble by no less than 20.5% on 2 January.
Today, the Belarusian citizens are visibly filled with fear, and understandably so, if one realises that the average monthly salary has suddenly dropped from USD 400 to USD 333, the dollar being, alongside the euro, a much-desired currency in Minsk and far beyond today.
Might this decline in the Belarusian economic position put paid to the chance of a new domestic and foreign orientation of the Lukashenko Government?
This is certainly not an imaginary risk, because, quite apart from the current financial problems, a cosmetic change of course on the part of Mr Lukashenko in the direction of the West is just as plausible.
In that case, the powerful president would simply replace his strategy of simulated integration with Russia with simulated rapprochement to the European Union.
The forthcoming gas negotiations with Russia could well give such simulation an extra boost.
The European Union should use a balanced strategy to resist an undesired political scenario of this kind in Minsk.
To this end, all European institutions need to contact all Belarusian institutions, including the state authorities, the opposition forces, civil society, and even the non-working population.
This is an inspiring European goal which hopes to develop, and build bridges in, contacts with all sections of Belarusian society.
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FI) Madam President, energy statistics at Community level always used to be based on a gentlemen's agreement.
It was clear beforehand what the statistics were being compiled on, how accurate they had to be, and when they had to be ready for submission.
It has not been that way for a little while now, however.
EU enlargement, certain statistics practices which came along with it, and other reforms, such as the liberalisation of the energy markets and alternative forms of energy, have together created the need speedily to draft a Community-wide legal framework for compiling statistics.
The compromise package now before us is the result of intensive talks in which gentlemanly behaviour had to be sought to some extent, though in the end it was found, to the benefit of one and all.
The energy statistics process was supposed only to be a mere footnote to Parliament's statistics on labour, but the rapporteur, Mr Turmes, has succeeded in playing an official political game of dry and technical statistics to stir up deep passions.
The calls for detailed statistics on the nuclear fuel cycle, energy end-use and extended statistics on renewable energy, as well as ambitious demands to bring forward the annual Eurostat reports, were all examples of politically oriented moves.
To be fit for purpose, however, statistics need to be a neutral tool, no more.
As the shadow rapporteur for my group, I was given the role of arbiter.
With regard to that, the views held by Eurostat and the Council were a long way off from the aims of our rapporteur.
I would now like to thank all the parties concerned for their prudent desire for a compromise, meaning that the regulation we have been waiting for can now swiftly enter into force.
The reforms pushed for by Mr Turmes will also be taken into account in the regulation, though in a realistic way.
We also found consensus on what the regulation is to cover and what should be left to other areas of legislation.
A splendid example of this is peat: we are not now adopting a position on its classification as a fossil or a renewable fuel, in that it renews itself every year, in this context.
Let us leave that little battle to the forthcoming debate on the directive on future renewable forms of energy, when our paths will surely cross once again.
<D>
(SV) Mr President, as we all know, our report documents 1 245 cases of illegal CIA flights, 21 illegal abductions and numerous cases of torture and abuse.
We demanded that prison camps such as Guantánamo be closed and that the EU guarantee that these abuses would never be repeated.
What did we get?
Very little unfortunately.
The USA continues its abuses in the so-called war on terrorism.
It was depressing to hear the Council's response to our important demands.
I want to hear a European Council say that we are to put pressure on the USA, that their kidnappings must cease and that all prison camps must be closed.
I want the EU - not just us in the European Parliament - to say that we are standing up for human rights.
I want the EU to say that the fight against terrorism can never be waged by illegitimate means.
It is clear that human rights must be fought for all over again every day.
Let us continue to act as watchdogs and ensure that not a single innocent person becomes a casualty of the so-called war on terrorism.
<D>
Question 6 has been withdrawn.
As they deal with the same subject, the following questions will be taken together:
Subject: EU-Russia visa regime
The Spanish Presidency of the Council intends to work towards the future abolition of the visa regime for EU and Russian citizens.
This may be a long process, and one that will depend a great deal on Russia's ability to implement successfully the action plan drawn up with this objective in mind.
Were the EU to open up to Russia's province of Kaliningrad, or vice versa, this would demonstrate that the EU and Russia are moving towards 'demolishing visa walls'.
Both Russia and the EU have an interest in the principle of cooperation on both sides of the border and in an anti isolationist policy regarding the Kaliningrad region.
To that end, neighbouring Poland and Lithuania have reached agreement on making it easier for people living in border areas to cross the border, but this has yet to be implemented.
How does Council assess the specific situation of the province of Kaliningrad in terms of the dialogue between the EU and Russia on visa matters?
How could this dialogue be used in order to sign local traffic agreements between EU Member States (Lithuania and Poland) and the Russian Federation in order to make border crossing procedures easier for people living in border areas?
Subject: EU-Russia relations: Spanish Presidency agenda
The Spanish Presidency of the EU has set out an ambitious agenda when it comes to EU-Russia relations - it would like to see the conclusion of negotiations with Russia on the new partnership and cooperation agreement (PCA), an agreement with Russia on a visa-free regime, as well as progress on a free-trade agreement between the EU and Russia.
In order to conclude a free-trade agreement with the EU, Russia first needs to become a member of the World Trade Organisation (WTO).
Are there tangible prospects that Russia will join the WTO any time soon?
Does the Council have a particular strategy on how to compel Russia to join the WTO?
Does the Council see any substantial progress as concerns the negotiations with Russia on the new PCA?
Does the Council consider that the idea of a free-trade regime with Russia is timely considering the disagreements within the EU on the issue?
Does the Council consider Russia to be more prepared for a visa-free regime than other partners of the EU, such as Ukraine, Moldova or Georgia?
<D>
(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, in recent years you have seen how sensitive a product wine is.
Here today we are mainly putting the case for the liberalisation of the wine market regulations.
You talk about opening up to the world market.
I sometimes wonder, who is guiding whom here?
Traditionally our wine-making has evolved in Europe.
Our traditions and our regional identity are what characterises our wine, and that should also guide us in the deliberations we are now having on the wine market regulations.
I was struck by the fact that here things have been incorporated into the wine market regulations through Committee, things which we have not debated at all in Parliament!
The question, Commissioner, is what national and regional regulation options still exist?
What restrictions or bans can Member States impose for their regions involved in making the lowest grade of wine?
That is what this is about, we are not talking about wines of origin and home wines, but about the lowest grade of wines.
For example, would the ban on blending red and white wine be a regional or national ban?
Would that be possible in future for these low-grade wines?
Or a ban on the indication of grape variety and vintage: this also causes us problems, as we want to be able to differentiate our wines, the lower wines from those described as home wines or wines of origin.
So French Rosé or German Riesling, those are names which need a clear, unambiguous regulation.
They are linked to our traditional producers and we set great store by this for the future.
Therefore, we ask for your support.
<D>
I shall start with a short announcement.
I strongly condemn the attack by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea against the South Korean island of Yeonpyeong.
I am deeply concerned regarding today's events on the Korean Peninsula.
Using raw force and military power will not solve any issues and further loss of human lives must be avoided.
In the interests of the Korean Peninsula and the wider region, the North and South should make efforts to rebuild confidence in a durable way.
This is why I welcome the announcement by President Lee Myung-bak that the South Korean Government intends to avoid escalation of the worrying situation.
I call on the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to immediately stop any hostile actions and to refrain from all activities that risk further escalation.
The Korean Armistice Agreement must be fully respected by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
<D>
Mr President, before my customary three points, I want to take issue with what Nigel Farage of the UKIP talked about.
He mentioned the word 'chicken'.
We might, perhaps, expect that something will be going on during the vote and I would like to say that you are what you wear during the vote.
We will see what UKIP looks like.
I have three points.
My first point is that, in the European Union, we are in a constant process of change.
We stood here and dealt with a similar report two years ago, and I would really like to congratulate the rapporteurs, Richard Corbett and Íñigo Méndez de Vigo, on a job well done.
What happened in 2005 was unfortunate.
What we have done since is crisis management.
This is really what Europe is all about.
We need to solve problems; we solved a treaty problem and, hopefully, we can get on now.
My second point is that I think the Treaty that we have in front of us is a great improvement on the Nice Treaty.
It is an improvement in terms of efficiency: we get more qualified majority voting, we get a legal personality, we get a great deal more on external relations and good stuff on justice and home affairs.
It is also an improvement of democracy.
The European Parliament increases its powers, the Charter of Fundamental Rights comes into the Treaty and the national parliaments get more powers.
So, in many ways, it is a great improvement on the Nice Treaty.
My third and final point, however, is that now it is time to move on.
I congratulate those five countries that have already ratified the Treaty.
The sooner we can push this Treaty through, the better off all of us will be, because it is time to move on, focus on real business, on legislation, on taking smart European decisions.
When we do that, however, we must not forget that we have a vision.
That vision is of a unified Europe, because the European Union is the only organisation that has given us four things.
Those four things are peace, prosperity, stability and security.
<D>
(RO) Nowadays in Chişinău, Madam President, you have the right to remain silent, you have the right to do what you are told and you have the right to pay taxes to an elite that is answerable to no one, as well as to emigrate, to conform and, if necessary, to hate on command.
You do not have the right to free expression, association, public debate and not even the right to decide your identity yourself.
Commissioner, these are the conditions then for stabilising the Republic of Moldova, but they do not offer any grounds for optimism.
Having embarked on this road, the only fate that can await Moldova, in the best case scenario, is that of Belarus.
Long before the elections, the Communist Party managed to gain and consolidate its absolute control over all the mass media channels.
These measures have made the democratic process devoid of content and forced a quarter of the country's population to emigrate.
Against this background the elections could not have taken place without any seed of doubt.
The repression exercised by Chişinău has now become a means for the authorities to communicate with the population.
Therefore, from now on, the EU cannot afford to adopt an indulgent, ambivalent attitude to the regime in Chişinău.
From now on, our silence or these ambivalent statements will indicate our approval and complicity in showing contempt for fundamental freedoms and the democratic legal system, as well as in acts of violence and repression.
Last but not least, the crisis in Chişinău demonstrates that we must improve the methods we use for observing and monitoring elections and rethink the role of our permanent representative there.
<D>
President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, we move from one item to the next.
This is a very serious and important subject which the honourable Members have raised and chosen to put on the agenda.
On Monday, 28 September, more than 100 people were killed in Conakry, Guinea, when members of the Guinean security forces shot into crowds of demonstrators.
Guinean citizens had gathered in a stadium in the capital to demonstrate against the presumed intention of the Guinean military interim leader, Captain Moussa Dadis Camara, to run for President.
The final death toll is still unknown, as the soldiers also collected the bodies rather than allow them to be counted at public morgues.
At this stage, we do not know the real dimension of these tragic events.
The number of injured people is said to be at least 1 200, and eye witnesses have reported that soldiers raped women on the streets of Conakry.
During the violent repression, several opposition leaders were wounded and temporarily arrested.
The number of protestors still under detention is also unknown; the houses of opposition leaders were ransacked and shops looted by uniformed men.
In a TV statement the following day, Captain Camara expressed his condolences with the families of those killed and visited some of the injured.
He proclaimed two days of national mourning and pledged to investigate the violence.
He distanced himself from the killings by saying that he was not in control of the elements of the military responsible for the atrocities.
The European Union immediately and forcefully condemned these brutal and shocking events.
A Presidency declaration, a statement by High Representative Solana and a statement by EU Commissioner De Gucht were issued the following day.
We will have to insist on the liberation of the arrested prisoners and a thorough investigation of the events.
The violence in Guinea received worldwide condemnation.
The UN Security Council was briefed last Wednesday on the situation in the country.
The African Union condemned the events and decided to prepare a report on possible measures to be taken.
The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) called for a full international inquiry into the matter.
Parliament, as you know, condemned the unconstitutional change of power, and in its resolution of 15 January 2009, called for respect for human rights and a rapid return to constitutional order.
The EU decided to open consultations under Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement, and EU development aid - apart from humanitarian aid and support for democratic transition - was frozen.
We have not been alone.
Our international partners have acted in line with us.
The African Union and ECOWAS decided to suspend Guinea until it established a democratically elected parliament or government.
An international contact group on Guinea co-chaired by the African Union and ECOWAS, and with participation by the European Union, was put into place.
In March, the military junta agreed with the opposition to have elections before the end of 2009, which gave reasonable hope for a peaceful and democratic transition.
Captain Camara gave his assurances that none of the coup leaders would stand for political office.
A national transitional council was to guide the transition process and prepare the necessary modification of the constitution in order to help elections.
What can we do, then, to prevent further violence, and how can we help the people of Guinea in their legitimate desire for democracy, the rule of law, peace and development?
Well, there are three main areas of action.
First of all, we should maintain and reinforce political pressure on the regime in Conakry, notably in the context of the international group.
Captain Camara's decision not to run could allow calm to return.
The nomination of the President of Burkina Faso, Mr Blaise Compaoré, as facilitator in the crisis on behalf of ECOWAS and the International Contact Group, is a very positive sign, and the European Union has welcomed this appointment via the Presidency.
We hope that his mediation will contribute to a secure, peaceful and lasting solution to the situation in Guinea.
Secondly, the option of targeted sanctions against individuals responsible for violence could be further explored.
We will need to coordinate this approach with the African Union and other international and bilateral partners.
The upcoming EU-African Ministerial Troika in Addis Ababa and the meeting on Guinea on 12 October in Abuja will be important in this respect.
Thirdly, we should continue to provide humanitarian aid to the civilian population and support the democratic transition process.
The latter will nevertheless depend on the credible willingness of the transitional authorities of Guinea to re-engage in a peaceful and constructive dialogue with a clear commitment to refraining from further violence and to respecting the human rights and political freedoms of its citizens.
We will spare no efforts to help the people of Guinea in this critical moment and we are determined to support a return to civilian, constitutional and democratic government through free and transparent elections.
We encourage all stakeholders in Guinea to refrain from violence and to make a peaceful and democratic transition.
<D>
We are hoping that by the final October session of the European Council at the latest, the final obstacles will have disappeared preventing the Treaty of Lisbon from coming into force.
This agreement may, in many respects, inspire the European Union to have a more efficient decision-making process.
I would like to highlight one example: energy security.
One sign of progress is that, unlike up until now, energy policy has been given a separate section in an EC Treaty.
Based on the events of the last few years, I think that the new chapter will set out the guidelines in the EU's energy policy.
The objectives to be supported include the development of energy efficiency, support for the use of renewable sources and the interconnection of networks.
As an MEP from a new Member State, I am particularly pleased that the concept of solidarity also features in the new energy chapter.
However, the Treaty of Lisbon does not in any way, at least when it comes to energy policy, present us with a ready-made solution.
The inclusion of the new chapter acts much more as a warning: Europe needs to take urgent steps to reduce its dependency and promote its environmental views.
The Treaty of Lisbon in itself offers absolutely no guarantee, just an opportunity.
This is an opportunity for Member States to consolidate the foundations of a common EU energy policy, while being aware of their own interests.
The development of alternative supply routes, the interconnection of networks or even the provision of protection against external purchases cannot be conceived in the future without a suitable degree of political determination and cooperation from Member States.
<D>
in writing. - (DE) Soil is a vital asset.
As a non-renewable resource, it is of the utmost importance in sustaining biodiversity, as a source of raw materials and also as a storage and filter medium for nutrients and water.
Soil, however, is not something that crosses borders, nor can it be shifted by the European Union.
Protecting our soils is in the best interests of those who own land and therefore falls within the responsibility of the Member States.
This application of the subsidiarity principle must remain intact.
There is no justification for ignoring all the existing European legal provisions and the dedication of farmers right down to the present day and to enact new provisions running parallel to the European directives, national statutes and cross-compliance rules that directly or indirectly affect the protection of soil.
Among the numerous soil-related directives and regulations enacted by the EU are such instruments as the Nitrates Directive, the Water Framework Directive, the Emissions Trading Directive and the Plant Protection Products Directive.
The bureaucratic commitments that could hit the Member States and the farming community is in stark contrast to the common efforts to eliminate red tape.
In addition, the precautionary measures envisaged in the draft directive impinge on every aspect of the law as it relates to agriculture.
I consider a European soil protection directive to be superfluous and inexpedient, and I have voted against this proposal.
<D>
Madam President, I would, of course, like to thank Mr Fava and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs.
Major efforts have been made by various parties to reach an agreement at first reading and, given the broad majorities in favour of this on the LIBE Committee several days ago and on the Permanent Representatives Committee just before Christmas, I think we will get there.
This text, of course, does not fulfil the initial ambitions in all respects.
The Commission can, however, support this compromise without hesitation.
This directive lets us introduce an effective instrument, a common framework to discourage the employment of workers from third countries who are residing illegally.
The Commission will be vigilant about the inspections.
The compromise text recommends better targeted, qualitative inspections, so it remains to be seen in the coming years if these qualitative criteria have been used and if the obligation on Member States to regularly identify the risk sectors for illegal working on their territory has been really effective.
This is what we want, in order to fight against the employment of people from third countries residing illegally and, above all, to impose sanctions on the employers who profit from these people.
Examination of the implementation of the provisions relating to the inspections will, therefore, be a priority for the Commission in its future reports on the application of this directive.
In addition, there are, of course, positive results emerging from this compromise, particularly the consensus achieved on the difficult question of subcontracting.
I have noted that Mr Fava was hoping for a statement from the Council and Parliament.
Personally, I do not see any drawbacks.
The Commission is pleased that the directive recommends criminal sanctions for particularly serious cases, for which these sanctions are both necessary and appropriate.
They are necessary to reinforce the deterrent since, in the most serious cases, administrative sanctions are not sufficient to deter unscrupulous employers.
They are appropriate in an instrument intended to match the ambitious European policy to combat illegal immigration.
In this context, the Commission appreciates the fact that criminalisation of employers of the victims of trafficking has been reinserted in the text in the final compromise.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this directive is a first significant step in the fight against illegal immigration.
It targets the practices of unscrupulous employers, whilst protecting migrant workers who, most often, are the victims in such cases.
This directive should be adopted and implemented quickly.
The Commission will support and accompany this process by calling regular meetings of experts from the Member States during the transposition phase to discuss any issues that might arise.
It is an important tool and the Commission will do everything necessary to ensure this tool is used effectively.
My thanks go to Parliament, Mr Fava and the LIBE Committee.
<D>
(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this resolution on relaunching the Lisbon Strategy is very much in line with the report which Parliament adopted last October, on my proposal, on the future strategy for the Single Market.
I should like first of all to thank Marianne Thyssen and Klaus-Heiner Lehne, along with all their colleagues in the Coordination Group, for having drafted a resolution which is both well balanced and in step with the political, economic and social reality in the EU.
I should like to draw particular attention to the proposals concerning the importance of social rights and reconciling economic competitiveness with the social model: what I would say is that we must, of course, go much further here and adopt the provisions on services of general interest.
I would also underline what the report says about intellectual property.
This is a major weapon for the EU and for SMEs.
The international dimension which the resolution introduces is something new, and very necessary.
The Single Market is what puts Europe's 500 million citizens in a position of strength in a globalised world.
Lastly, I would just like to say a few words on the question of method.
I am not sure that the open method of coordination, which is the method currently used, is the most effective.
I personally think that in a number of areas of the Lisbon Strategy we need to move on to genuinely common policies, Community policies, if we want to be successful in the future.
<D>
in writing. - (FR) In the 1960s, having agreed the benefits of planning, the French Parliament voted a growth rate for the economy every year with a view to taking its decisions on that basis, since it turned out for several years in succession that actual growth was exactly as it had voted.
I get the same impression from reading Mr Florenz's report: the impression that this Parliament intends to vote on the world's temperature.
Let me make this clear: what I am criticising is not man's need to protect his environment, to preserve the immense diversity of nature or, in terms of economics, to find the means to use natural resources better in order to save them.
It is the ritual sacrifice to the new religion of climate and its new gurus, these partially-minded scientists who pour anathema on all those whose work opposes their untouchable conclusions.
It is the systematic stigmatisation of Man as a supposedly evil entity, especially the Western and European variety.
This is institutionalised repentance.
It is the industrial and economic suicide of Europe, alone at the altar of so-called global warming, with no benefit to the environment worldwide, but the worst human and social consequences for the peoples of Europe.
That is why I voted against this report.
<D>
(NL) European farmers who grow tobacco should not receive a single cent from the EU for it.
Obviously tobacco subsidies have been a huge source of revenue for farmers for many years, a sort of social security policy that did not deserve the name.
However, tax revenue should not, on principle, be spent on unhealthy products.
Hence there is only one choice as far as subsidies are concerned: abolish them.
The proposal in the Berlato report is a ridiculous attempt to get tobacco subsidies extended until at least 2012.
That should not happen, and there is another reason for this.
Developing countries see it as totally unfair that European tobacco should be subsidised.
It is unfair competition with poor farmers and it is directly counter to European Union development policy, a classic example of the way in which one policy area can cut into another.
Encourage European farmers to grow crops that now bring in a high price, such as grain, which is badly needed.
Show solidarity, though, and let the tobacco subsidies go up in smoke, for the sake of public health and for the sake of cohesion in European policy for the development of the poorest countries in the world.
That is solidarity.
<D>
in writing. - The recent elections in Zimbabwe were a sham with Mugabe being the only eventual candidate, having intimated Tsvangirai and other members of the MDC to the point of withdrawal.
There should now be fresh presidential elections in this country precluding most vehemently state-sponsored violence, intimidation and murder.
I welcome yesterday's decision of the G8 summit in Japan to adopt financial and other sanctions against members of the Zimbabwean government.
It is significant that there has been consensus at this level, even from Russia, on a strong condemnation of the Mugabe regime.
A UN Security Council resolution concluding that Zimbabwe is now a threat to international peace and security is looking likely.
I would urge China not to block this important action during this coming week.
I regret that the African Union is not doing enough to isolate Mugabe as I believe that this union, along with the Southern African Development Community and the Pan-African Parliament, are the key forums which should be charged with removing such a despot.
The human rights violations currently being perpetrated by the Zimbabwean government are bordering on crimes against humanity and I believe that the UN Security Council should also therefore consider referring members of this government to the International Criminal Court in the not too distant future.
<D>
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, as Mr Ettl said, we are facing a great challenge.
All our fellow citizens have now realised that the climate is a challenge.
Few have realised that democracy is a challenge.
However, having said that, where is the demographic problem in Europe located?
In the towns, of course, since 80% of the population is concentrated in towns.
What is the issue for citizens today living in towns, and for mayors, since I know other fellow Members, MEPs like me, are also the mayors or deputy mayors of their towns?
Let me take two sets of examples.
A set of economic examples on the one hand.
Where towns either have to accommodate a large population or, as in certain towns in East Germany, watch many of their inhabitants leave, in the second instance this means unoccupied housing, unused roads, districts heated for no reason, empty schools and, in the first it means building a school for EUR 5 million, as I have just done in my town, or a new neighbourhood centre for EUR 7 million.
These represent economic expenditure that has to be borne by the towns and by the towns' taxpayers.
However, this is not just an economic challenge, it is also a human one because, in these neighbourhoods, when you see people who are isolated, when the whole neighbourhood is ageing, when you cannot hear the happy shouts of children playing in the street any more, that is a human relations problem.
There are jobs that nobody wants, as you know.
You cannot find a plumber in some small towns.
We do not have enough nurses any more in my town.
We do not have enough home helps any more, so people have to wait.
Instead of having two hours' help per day, we only get one.
This is a serious human problem.
Commissioner, going beyond the report by my fellow Member, Mrs Castex, which I will be delighted to vote for tomorrow, I would ask you, in my capacity as chairman of the Urban Housing Intergroup, to put forward a proposal on towns for us, so a chart can be set up in the near future for each town that enables us better to understand and control the demographic situation in our towns in the medium and long term, so decisions can be taken on housing, transport, schools, etc.
<D>
(RO) I would like to emphasise the fact that while Mr Cappato initially enjoyed broad support for his initiative, the 18 amendments introduced later on have resulted in a loss of that initial support.
Nevertheless, I support the fact that public access to the documents held by Parliament, the Council and the Commission is vital in order to bring the European Union closer to its citizens.
I would first of all like to stress the need to publish the main documents created in the course of the comitology procedure.
Secondly, I think that on the European Parliament website under the personal profiles detailing the activities of each MEP, it would be a good idea to also publish the amendments submitted by each MEP in the parliamentary committees they belong to.
Citizens need to clearly see what amendments have been submitted by MEPs during the European decision-making process, in addition to the reports, resolutions and plenary debates.
Thirdly, when the European Council is acting as a co-legislative institution in addition to Parliament, it should publish its debates just like Parliament publishes its own debates.
The Council should demonstrate transparency by publishing its debates from now on before the Lisbon Treaty obliges it to do so.
<D>
Vice-President of the Commission. - (DE) Mr President, Mr Ryan, I am very grateful to you for this question because it addresses a problem with which the Commission has been deeply concerned for years: how to reduce unnecessary red tape for small and medium enterprises in Europe.
I am glad to be able to tell you that we have indeed made huge progress in this area and I am firmly convinced that we are about to see a real breakthrough.
Basically we have identified the costs of red tape for European enterprises as costs arising from reporting, documentation and information obligations.
We are currently engaged in actually measuring those costs, in the largest project of its kind in the whole of history.
That means we really are establishing what costs these rules actually create for enterprises so that we can then see where the costs come from and whether they can be reduced.
You can expect a large number of Commission proposals from about September this year, based on the results of the measurements and the screening of all the existing rules.
We expect that will enable us to put forward so many proposals by the end of 2009 that the cost of red tape for European enterprises will fall by 25% in the year 2012.
We are assuming that will trigger a 1.4% to 1.5% growth in the entire European GNP.
So you can see we really are talking significant orders of magnitude.
You then addressed a particular problem that is, however, quite distinct from the matter of normal bureaucratic costs.
It is the burden placed on small enterprises in particular to comply with the tax requirements - and you know that the European Union's powers in this regard are extremely limited.
We know from all our inquiries that the enterprises themselves feel that the requirements of the financial authorities represent by far the most serious and heaviest burden, so this is an area where it really is up to the Member States to simplify matters.
After all, we only have competences in the area of turnover taxes and even there they are very limited.
The Commission has, however, made one very important proposal that would be a great help to small and medium enterprises: it is substantially to raise the threshold above which they need to declare turnover tax in advance, i.e. register for VAT.
The current threshold is EUR 20 000, we want to raise it to EUR 100 000, which would free nearly all very small enterprises and in particular newly established enterprises from this heavy burden.
Sadly I must tell you that so far the Member States have not been prepared to accept that proposal.
I hope that the Small Business Act that the Commission presented a few days ago and in which we addressed the question once again will put more pressure on those Member States that are creating difficulties here and I am extremely grateful to the European Parliament for its numerous signs of support in this regard.
<D>
Mr President, thank you very much.
It feels quite a milestone - sorry, was that millstone or milestone? - to have reached.
This report has an interesting title: 'The conservation of fisheries resources through technical measures'.
Because I really have to say, if we really want the best technical measure to conserve fishing stocks, it is not to be found in the common fisheries policy.
The results are there: the common fisheries policy has been a failure when it comes to conserving fishing stocks.
It is time - and long overdue - that we look at results around the world that have worked.
Let us look at the example of Iceland, where they have come up with property-based solutions and rights that can be handed down.
Let us look at the example of New Zealand, where rights to fishing grounds have been handed on from generation to generation.
In both cases it shows that, if you trust the market, you trust the rule of law and you trust property rights, more often than not that will find a better solution than some Soviet-style centrally planned scheme, such as the common fisheries policy, which has proved a disaster.
It is time to have faith in the market.
<D>
Madam President, to reply to Mrs Panayotopoulos, I would say to her that the Council fully shares her opinion on the need to reach an agreement, as soon as possible, on the proposed regulation setting out methods for applying Regulation No 883/2004, which relates to the coordination of social security systems.
This means establishing the conditions for the adoption of this regulation in order to complete, by May 2009 if possible, the reform of the coordination of social security systems.
This proposed regulation, presented by the Commission in January 2006, has since, given the breadth and highly technical nature of its provisions, been subject to chapter-by-chapter examination under the successive Presidencies.
Thanks to the sustained efforts of the preceding Presidencies, partial general approaches have been adopted.
This process was completed last month under the French Presidency with the adoption of the partial general approaches on the two remaining chapters, relating to benefits for accidents at work and occupational illnesses and also death benefits.
Meanwhile, Parliament gave its opinion last July at first reading.
The Council welcomes the broad convergence of views with Parliament.
It sees in this the fruits of some highly constructive cooperation, initiated between the two institutions from the very beginning of the examination of this text.
The adoption of a common position on the draft regulation is, for the French Presidency, one of the major steps towards increasing personal mobility within the Union.
This is why the Presidency will do whatever it can to have this common position adopted at the Council meeting on 15 December, so that Parliament can adopt it in its part-session next January.
<D>
(SV) Issues concerning the environment and climate affect us all.
As we know, they are global in scope.
It is self-evident that the EU must play a leading role in the fight to safeguard our living conditions.
Environmental experts claim that, after industry, the next most important cause of damage to the climate and the next largest source of emissions is all the primitive hearths and cookers that are found in huts and hovels all around Africa, Asia and South America.
A few nations that are focusing on protecting the environment have at last realised this.
Today, there are solar-powered, simple stoves that, for a small amount of money, remove 95% of these toxic emissions that black coal, manure and other fuels generate on combustion.
Calculations also show, and this must be the most important thing to point out, that nearly two million people die a premature death because they are forced to breathe in these gases.
I hope that the EU, together with the United States, which has demonstrated an awareness of this problem, will take an active interest in this extremely tangible means of saving people and the environment.
<D>
(SV) I would like to start by thanking the Court of Auditors for a constructive report that is unusually easy to follow.
It will, I am sure, form a sound basis for our ongoing work in the Committee on Budgetary Control.
I thought I would restrict myself mainly to the EU's independent authorities, as I am actually rapporteur for them.
Some institutions are, of course, growing in terms of numbers, responsibility and how much money they have at their disposal.
I would therefore like to suggest that examination of these institutions is also becoming increasingly important.
Every year that I have been here in the European Parliament we have commented on the problems the independent authorities have with regard to planning, implementing the budget, public procurement, reporting and so on, and, unfortunately, it looks like we will have to do the same thing again this year.
The same is true with regard to the problem of their requesting more and more money, despite them having trouble spending it during previous years.
I think that this raises a number of important questions, as it seems to be a recurring problem.
At least for me, it raises questions about responsibility and control.
I therefore think that it is particularly unfortunate that the Council is not here to participate in the debate, as I think that we have a joint responsibility to ensure that these decentralised authorities are controlled and monitored.
In addition to these general comments, which are for the most part applicable to a considerable number, although not all, of the decentralised authorities, there are four authorities that I think we have grounds for examining more closely this year.
The first is the European Police College, CEPOL, which has again this year received remarks for its public procurement, and this is a recurring problem that has not been addressed.
Furthermore, it is even more remarkable that the Court of Auditors has pointed out that money has been used to pay private expenses.
Another one is Galileo, in connection with which the Court of Auditors has not yet been able to issue a statement about whether or not they want to give a simple statement of assurance, simply because there is so much uncertainty surrounding the relationship between Galileo and the European Space Agency and the other players involved.
Where does Galileo begin and end?
Last but not least are Frontex and the European Railway Agency, both of which are clear examples of authorities which overestimate their costs and demand too much money, but nevertheless request more money every year.
These are matters that I intend to look more closely at during the discharge process.
I hope to continue the constructive cooperation with both the Court of Auditors and the Commission and I am disappointed that the Council is not here to contribute to this discussion.
<D>
(CS) Mr President, Commissioner, I too am not happy about the curious changes to the agreement, such as refunds of customs charges on imported components in the case of products for export to the Union and a reduction in the 60% threshold for determining the country of origin.
This amounts to favouring Korean imports at the expense of the competitiveness of European industry and at the expense of unemployment.
The lion's share in this respect already goes to imported goods from Asia, where labour costs are uncompetitively low, due to poor or non-existent social and environmental standards.
The trade talks should therefore have focused on raising these standards, rather than on the prosperity of Asian industry at the expense of Europe.
The Commission has long owed this to the citizens of Europe.
Does the Commission have any awareness of the negative impact of the agreement on European competitiveness and on employment in the automobile and textile industries?
Secondly, is it aware that the agreement sets an unfortunate precedent for future trade agreements?
Thirdly, does the Commission intend to ignore the fundamental objections raised by European engineering unions?
Fourthly, how is it that the Korean media are already celebrating a victory for their automobile industry when the agreement has not even been discussed by the College of the Commission?
Or is the Commission prepared to revise the draft and to negotiate a balanced agreement?
Does the Commission have the will to put pressure on Korea to adopt international obligations in respect of social and environmental standards and will it do so before Korea gains all of the benefits of free trade with the European Union?
Thank you for your answer.
I trust that common sense will prevail.
<D>
(PT) Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at this moment in time, the world's powers are tackling the international financial system.
They are trying to get it under control, and not before time.
It is also perhaps time that we solved another problem that we have been talking about for decades.
For years, we have been listening to tales of the shameful pillaging of resources.
How many times, and now again in the Congo, have we heard about the blood of people being shed?
I believe it is also time to prosecute these companies, halt this disgraceful trade and freeze the accounts holding the shameful profits from this exploitation of mineral resources at the cost of the blood and suffering of people.
I do not understand why these companies are not listed in the same way as we blacklist terrorist organisations.
I do not understand why the international community is incapable of prosecuting these businesspeople who are not strictly businesspeople, but actually bandits who are threatening regional and world security.
I urge the French Presidency and the Commission to lead an international initiative in this respect.
<D>
The European Union needs Turkey and Turkey needs the EU.
It is important not simply in terms of trade and economic ties and investments.
Almost 100 years ago, Turkey turned to face Europe and it can and must become a bridge linking our continent with the Muslim world.
Unfortunately, it has to be acknowledged that negotiations on Turkey's accession to the EU have slowed.
The EU is waiting for progress, particularly as regards protecting human rights, gender equality and safeguarding freedom of expression, freedom of the press and religious freedoms.
Normalisation of relations with Cyprus is another important issue.
This conflict must be resolved in a manner that is favourable for both Turkey and Cyprus.
It is important to reach a peaceful solution to the conflict.
Events in North Africa demonstrate the important contribution Turkey has to make, spreading stability and democratic values.
The people of Libya, Egypt and other Arab nations view Turkey and the EU as an example that they need to follow.
I voted in favour of the report, because it is well balanced.
It reflects well the state of Turkey's EU integration in 2010.
I have always agreed with Turkish membership.
However, this country would have to implement the Ankara Protocol and do more, particularly as regards minorities, women, press freedoms and the rule of law.
<D>
(EL) Madam President, the myth of convergence and cohesion between the countries and regions of the European Union is being demolished by reality itself:
economic and social inequalities are constantly increasing;
artificial statistical convergences caused by the accession of the new Member States cannot deceive the workers, farmers, young people and women, who see their standard of living constantly deteriorating;
regional development within capitalist frameworks cannot remove class conflicts in the system;
unequal development is inherent in the capitalist method of production, because the incentive for any development process is the maximisation of capital;
national cohesion tactics and the operational programmes of the NSRF 2007-2013, like previous programmes, have a specific class orientation: they obey the anti-grassroots approach of the Lisbon Strategy and are adapted to national reform programmes; in other words, they promote capitalist restructurings and more flexible contracts of employment.
Thus the European Union and the bourgeois governments are serving the needs of capital, both for the period of the capitalist crisis, by shifting the entire burden onto the working class, onto the workers, and with the obvious objective of making these anti-labour measures permanent, in order to safeguard and increase the profits of the monopolies in the future as well.
The new relevant factor which has been added to the scope of cohesion policy is the concept of territorial cohesion and, more importantly, the Green Paper on it.
The reactionary character of the guidelines in the Commission proposal goes beyond the framework of the positions and competences of the European Union included in the Treaty of Lisbon, as the Euro-Constitution is now called, and this is an insult to the peoples in the Member States.
The Green Paper on territorial cohesion sets as immediate sectors the charge by the monopolies into health, education, energy and other services, the fundamental element being that of access to the transport networks above all.
The Greek Communist Party is categorically opposed to and rejects in its entirety the reactionary framework of the Commission's proposal on territorial cohesion.
<D>
in writing. - (RO) I supported, by voting, the proposal for a decision regarding the designation of the year 2010 as the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion.
In addition to the priority actions mentioned in the proposal for a decision, we consider it absolutely necessary to introduce a minimum guaranteed salary in all the EU Member States for an efficient fight against poverty.
In the country where I come from, Romania, after 3 years of right-wing government, 40% of the Romanian employees live below the poverty threshold because they cannot afford to pay the costs of the minimum consumer basket and of the current bills during winter.
Due to the 2005 introduction of the single tax rate by the right-wing government, an excessive polarization of society has occurred, as well as an increase in poverty.
In 2007, only 5% of the Romanian employees earned more than 2000 RON, approximately 500 Euros.
In the case of Romania, it is necessary to give up the single tax rate and adopt the progressive rate, at the same time with exemption from the tax on reinvested capital.
In this way, the society polarization would diminish and fair taxation would be achieved and people with low income would be taxed less than those with high and very high income.
<D>
in writing - (PL) I approve of the fact that the European Parliament has focused on rising food prices.
Unfortunately, these price rises are not a short-term phenomenon, but seem to be developing into a long-term trend.
This is compounded by a growing demand for food, notably for cereals, poor harvests in recent years and low stocks, and also unfortunately financial operations and a weakening dollar.
All this is causing chaos on the markets.
From our point of view the social consequences are more significant.
The populations of many countries are growing exponentially, and they are permanently malnourished and hungry.
Their despair creates a source of increasing political tension.
We cannot observe these events passively.
We need international cooperation under the auspices of the UN and the European Union.
Countries that are members of the G-20 should effectively counteract speculation in agricultural products.
We should look again at the regulation of agricultural markets in Europe so as not to artificially restrict potential growth.
There should be no speculation in global hunger as the effect of this speculation will be that many innocent people will die of hunger, especially in the poorest nations.
<D>
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, whom I greet as a newcomer to our Chamber, ladies and gentlemen, we have here a report with an abundance of suggestions.
I can certainly compliment Mrs Gurmai on the wealth of ideas that been incorporated into this report with a view to enhancing the technical sophistication of the vehicles on our roads.
By way of introduction, however, I cannot resist a remark on the expressions 'intelligent vehicle', 'intelligent infrastructure' and 'intelligent safety devices'.
As I have already said in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, I consider it downright unacceptable to apply this term to cars and roadways.
Intellegentia, intellegere, intellegens - these Latin terms have to do with discernment, perception and understanding.
They refer to the cognitive capacity of human beings, their ability to understand, to abstract, to solve problems and apply knowledge.
From a purely linguistic point of view it is utter nonsense to speak of intelligent vehicles and intelligent roads!
In the statement explaining her report, Mrs Gurmai writes, 'Ever-increasing road traffic generates serious social and environmental problems: congestion of road networks and urban areas, damage to the environment and to public health, energy wastage, accidents and, above all, the needless loss of lives'.
I wholeheartedly agree.
Nor do I seek to deny that cleverly conceived technology of the kinds with which this document abounds can help to make road traffic less dangerous and kinder to the environment.
It only goes a limited way, however, towards solving the real social and environmental problems.
I have recently been in quite a few school classrooms.
During these visits, I have taken the opportunity to ask several pupils from intermediate and senior secondary schools what they considered to be the main causes of the numerous road accidents.
The first answers were always 'too fast and dangerous speeds and drink-driving'.
The solutions we are coming up with here, however, are almost exclusively the kind advanced by the motor industry, which seeks to sell more and more new and technically sophisticated vehicles.
If rising fuel prices are a problem, if there is an urgent need to reduce energy consumption in general, if the irresponsibly high levels of CO2 emissions need to be lowered, and if we want to do something to combat climate change, we shall not put these things to rights with a philosophy of more and more, higher and higher, faster and faster, ever more sophistication and ever more mobility but much rather by adopting a different lifestyle, in which slower, more modest and thriftier are the order of the day.
There is one point I must dispute.
The rapporteur writes, 'For the consumer affordability is a key issue.
Many consumers simply cannot afford the systems in question.
It is therefore important that intelligent transport systems become affordable and widely available as soon as possible'.
The Heidelberg-based Environmental and Forecasting Institute (UPI) calculated a few years ago that, once all direct and indirect transport costs have been taken into account, the average car in Germany is subsidised by the government, in other words by the taxpayer, to the tune of some EUR 3 000 a year.
It is unacceptable that destruction of the environment and risks to public health should be subsidised.
On the contrary, those who cause the damage should pay in accordance with the principle of cost transparency.
Road construction and maintenance are not the only cost factors.
There are also the use of land and the many forms of damage to nature and human health.
Please do not misunderstand me, I am not opposed to better technology, but I am opposed to this blind faith in technology.
If we want to subsidise mobility, we should primarily support rail travel, local public transport, cycling and walking.
That would be more intelligent, healthier, safer and greener.

President-in-Office of the Council. - (SL) Mrs Ţicău, Mr Grosch, ladies and gentlemen, the European Commission published draft legislative instruments in July 2007.
These were the proposal for a regulation on common rules for admission to the occupation of road transport operator, the proposal for a regulation on common rules for access to the international road haulage market, and the proposal for a regulation on common rules for access to the market for transport services by coach and bus.
The Portuguese Presidency began work on the regulation on common rules for access to the international road haulage market, and the Slovenian Presidency continued this work and also opened the other two dossiers.
In parallel with the work in the working group, we also began informal talks with rapporteurs in the European Parliament.
At the April meeting of the Transport, Telecommunications and Energy (TTE) Council, ministers conducted a political debate based on a package with the main issues, with the following results.
Firstly, with regard to the regulation on common rules for access to the international road haulage market, the key question of cabotage remains unanswered.
Most Member States essentially supported the compromise decision under which three cabotage trips are permissible within seven days after unloading in the host Member State.
However, quite a lot of Member States, who were also supported by the Commission, called for transit cabotage also to be made possible, to avoid empty road traffic.
The Presidency is currently endeavouring to find a compromise solution in the Council.
Secondly, with regard to the regulation on admission to the occupation, a compromise needs to be found on the national electronic register and the register of transport undertakings.
In fact we shall soon be agreed on the timetable for establishing this register.
Thirdly, with regard to the regulation on international coach and bus services, the debate needs to be continued at working-group level.
We have agreed that the solutions in the other two regulations should also be applied analogously in this regulation.
The Slovenian Presidency will be endeavouring to achieve political agreement on these three proposed regulations in the TTE meeting on 13 June 2008.
I wish to emphasise that we shall try to take your requested amendments into consideration as far as possible and thus, to a great extent, bring our points of view into line with one another.
The Slovenian Presidency wishes to help to consolidate and complete the single market.
I am convinced that the fast-growing road transport sector constitutes one of the foundations of the single market for the free movement of goods and passenger transport, and that the Community's legal regime needs to be modernised, in order to be made more efficient, to have greater control, and to ensure honest competition.
The Slovenian Presidency unreservedly supports the aims set out in the proposals for the three regulations.
I should like to emphasise that the Slovenian Presidency is aware of the existing restrictions in the European Union's transport market, which means that it sees its task as lying not only in strengthening the rules and control mechanisms for cabotage, but also in introducing uniform rules for access to the occupation.
The electronic registers in particular will help to improve efficiency and transparency in the transport sector and to effect a substantial reduction in the administrative burden.
Lastly, I must thank MEPs and, in particular, the rapporteurs Mr Grosch and Mrs Ţicău for the constructive exchange of views.
Let me say again that the Slovenian Presidency will do everything in its power to achieve a balance between the various interests, and also to ensure that the solutions we accept will make the European road transport industry more efficient and more competitive.
At this point, I should like to say that it is my hope and wish that we shall continue the constructive dialogue, and that the European Parliament will achieve a consensus as soon as possible.
<D>
(NL) Like other speakers, I am terribly shocked that it has been possible for hundreds of thousands of litres of crude oil to gush into the sea for weeks on end without us managing to stop it.
I am also terribly shocked by the enormous damage this is causing and by the fact that the company in question, BP, is constantly playing this down.
We are being forced to face the facts, and we have not even been able to assess all the longer-term consequences.
It is essential, therefore, that we take the measures at European rather than national level that are needed to render such occurrences impossible in future.
In so doing, we must concentrate on the procedural and also the technical aspects, by imposing the necessary safety systems.
This has a cost, of course, but the cost of doing nothing would obviously be much higher.
In the past, we took the global lead by imposing double hulls for oil tankers.
I think that here, too, we should take the lead and set a good example.
<D>
in writing. - I voted in favour of the abovementioned report which includes an increase in loan commitments for programmes aiming at eradicating and tracking animal diseases as well as observing the physical well-being of animals which could present a threat to public health linked to external factors.
At the same time, I would like to emphasise my disagreement with the other issues raised in the report, which should not have been included in this report:
The creation of budget item 10 04 04 02 (Operation of the high-flux reactor (HFR));
The creation of budget item 18 05 02 03 (European Police);
A reinforcement of the Community subsidy to EUROJUST;
Modifications to the establishment plan of OLAF, without additional financial provisions.
<D>
in writing. - (PL) I would like to thank the French President for a speech that raises many of the EU's fundamental problems.
It is true that we must consider how to get Europe out of its crisis.
It is little consolation that virtually the whole world finds itself in a situation that is close to critical.
This has a significant economic and social dimension.
I am talking about the threat of hunger in many regions of the world, since food prices are rising steeply, about energy security and also about the status of the environment.
The world's financial system is becoming increasingly unstable.
Why am I placing emphasis on this?
Because it is not for us to be self-righteous.
The almost 500 million citizens of the EU currently constitute less than 8% of the world's population, and in 40 years' time this proportion will be barely at the election threshold - 5%.
Our European view must therefore not overlook values of a higher order linked to the maintenance of Euro-Atlantic civilisation.
This also has an ethical dimension.
In each country of the EU, then, we need due care for the family, which, while being a tiny community, is at the same time the cornerstone of the whole European Community.
We should not let this slip from our view.
If we do, we shall lose touch, as we are doing now, by abusing the word 'marriage' in applying it to unions that are not marriage.
It is true that we need new legal frameworks, but they must be ones that people can understand.
EU citizens are the subject of actions taken by Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
We are merely carrying out a service.
It is precisely in this light that we view the case of Ireland.
<D>
in writing. - The reasons for setting up this fund deserve our praise.
The resources being funnelled into this fund are a joke.
The key objectives of the fund should be the promotion of energy efficiency, energy saving and renewable energies, reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases and the improvement of access to energy services in the poorest countries, not to mention diversification of energy sources in the developing world.
Statistics (which are already outdated) indicate that 1.6 billion people do not have access to basic energy services.
2.4 billion people rely on traditional biomass for cooking and heating.
The International Energy Agency estimates that by 2010 USD 241 billion will be needed to be invested into renewable energy generation.
Regarding developing countries, the estimate is at least USD 10 billion or EUR 9 billion.
The proposed budget for this fund under discussion is EUR 80 million between 2007 and 2010, with EUR 15 million in 2008 to kick-start the initiative.
The figures speak for themselves.
These resources are but a drop in the ocean of what is needed.
The intentions are good but intentions with meagre funding do not correspond to serious initiatives.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, the 5% increase in the budget is explained by spending on the External Action Service, border protection, the war on terrorism, an increase in development aid, support for research and transnational infrastructure.
Overall, this request from Parliament is absolutely justified.
However, Parliament is also passing up an opportunity with the Garriga Polledo report.
We would have more credibility if we were to show where Europe can be more efficient and where money can be saved.
This certainly includes the large number of agencies that enjoy an extremely expensive autonomous existence, and agriculture, where some Member States have still not succeeded in introducing a more market-appropriate flat-rate acreage payment scheme.
As the rapporteur for the future of structural policy, I would also say that European cohesion policy should also be included here.
Happily, many regions have succeeded in exceeding the threshold for the maximum funding of 75%.
However, if there is less poverty in the various regions of Europe, then European solidarity may also recede.
The money saved could be better invested in European added value, for example, in a smart link between Structural Funds and transnational networks in the border regions.
This is currently under discussion by the Committee on Regional Development, as is a proposal for an intermediate category of 75 to 90% GDP, as suggested in the Garriga Polledo report.
Perhaps Mrs Krehl was dreaming if she believed that we had already agreed on a compromise in the Committee on Regional Development.
I do not believe that the temporary Special committee on the policy challenges and budgetary resources for a sustainable European Union after 2013 is the right body to make recommendations for such an intermediate category.
We are making things too easy for ourselves if we simply also define the more prosperous regions as requiring particular support.
The way I see it, this is an invitation to waste money.
We are leaving the tried and tested phasing-out/phasing-in system but are no longer offering any incentive.
We are guaranteeing a permanent subsidy for all regions almost up to a level of average economic strength.
There can be no future for a system like this in European regional policy.
We therefore need to drop paragraph 73 from the report.
Otherwise, the report is acceptable.
(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))
<D>
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, European need not, may not and cannot regulate everything.
Member State subsidiarity and less bureaucracy are the slogans of the moment, which we keep repeating when we speak with members of the public.
The European Union's competence is constantly being questioned, but Europe should and indeed must be the motive force for development.
The Commission's right of initiative is a documented right.
Where no legislative instrument exists, it uses that right of initiative to focus on a thorny subject, draw Member States' attention to abuses and call for action.
That is the legal basis of this Commission proposal, and we must use it.
We must curb the adverse effects on health of risky and excessive alcohol consumption and its social and economic consequences.
A European strategy is to be formulated in order to support the Member States in their endeavour to reduce and prevent alcohol-related damage.
That includes research into its root causes, as has just been said.
It also includes, however, informing, instructing and raising awareness among the public; that is the crux of the matter, those are the key points.
Every individual is free to decide.
But individuals can use that freedom only if they are informed about the consequences and effects of their actions.
Upbringing and education are the key factors.
Upbringing within the family lays the foundations for a well-ordered and solid way of life, and we should put the focus on that, followed by schooling and advice.
The same applies to alcohol awareness.
I support Parliament's report, which improves the Commission document in many areas.
I am, however, resolutely opposed to the calls for health warnings.
There are clear rules on the labelling of alcohol.
The labels indicate the alcohol content.
Transposing and understanding what it says on the labels is the basic way to pass on information.
That, ladies and gentlemen, is general knowledge!
Everybody must be in a position to use that information for themselves in a responsible manner.
The same applies to most things in life: to eating and drinking just as to exercise, sport and fitness.
<D>
rapporteur. - (RO) Just some brief replies.
On the subject of Eurocontrol, the reform process has started so that new responsibilities can be received.
On the subject of the 'owner of the air', I think that the happiest organisations after the approval of this report will be the airlines, including Ryanair.
On the subject of 'public use', this is the description which excludes even airports for air clubs or airports for pleasure flying.
This is the reason why we wanted to remove these airports from the regulation, so as not to complicate matters further.
I would also like to thank you for the positive feedback you have given on my efforts.
I think, however, that I could not have done this job alone, in any way at all.
This is why I would like to thank sincerely the rapporteurs from the other political groups, Mr Stockmann, Mr Leichtfried, Mr Degutis, Mr Zile and Mrs Lichtenberger for the special contributions they made to this dossier, as well as for the support they gave me during the negotiations with the Council.
I also want to point out that the majority of the suggestions in the amendments submitted for the plenary session by Mr Kohlíček and Mr Markov already feature in the compromise reached with the Council.
Commissioner, I would like to congratulate you on this success.
I hope that it will be ratified tomorrow by the vote in Parliament and by the Council vote at the end of this month.
I would like to thank the Commission's team of experts which worked alongside us to produce this agreement.
I also thank the French Presidency and Czech Presidency for their efforts, especially Thierry Boutsen and Vera Zazvorkova.
<D>
The growing rate of migration in the EU, including internally, has a number of important repercussions from a cultural, economic and social perspective.
In this respect, it is vitally important to guarantee migrants equal opportunities and to focus greater attention on combating discrimination against them.
On this point, the situation of the Roma, whose issues represent a special case and a degree of difficulty in a league of their own, speaks for itself.
I also want to draw attention to the repercussions on labour force mobility from the difficulties experienced by the children of those working abroad in integrating into a foreign educational environment.
For this reason, supporting the children's quickest possible integration may play an important role in preventing migrants becoming ghettoised, especially as it has been observed that the education level and social and economic situation of migrants' children are worse than those of the other children, hence the need for some impetus in this area.
The better the conditions provided for them to integrate as quickly as possible into the foreign education environment, the greater their chances of success in their education and in the labour market.
At the same time, however, learning the language of the host country and becoming locally assimilated must not mean abandoning their own cultural heritage.
<D>
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe has managed to create a so-called zero budget.
We are the only political level which has a zero budget.
We have 0.89% of gross national income available to us and we are a good example of how carefully European taxpayers' money can be used.
In addition, we have shown over a number of years that our revenue exceeds our spending.
We have a little left over every year and we should at last get around to using the money which remains for creating European added value in future.
Parliament and the Council should agree on how this money can contribute to European added value.
It is very important that we put these foundations in place.
Furthermore, we have just had a debate on the European Investment Bank.
I believe that, in particular in times of crisis, funds should be made available as quickly as possible.
We need an immediate allocation of funds, especially in the area of research, which offers future opportunities for new services and new products.
Simplifying the administration and reducing the amount of bureaucracy are important requirements, in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises, because they want to do business on world markets and to do this they need our support.
A strong focus on developing the infrastructures between the Member States, which the Economic Recovery Plan begins to address - to give one example, Nabucco and other energy pipelines - is crucial in this respect, because rapid investment is possible in this area.
If you think about how much steel is needed for these pipelines, it will become clear that our steel industry could, at least in the short term, achieve peak sales and job security.
We should work to achieve this.
<D>
(FR) Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating my fellow Member, Mr Szymański, for his balanced report on the review of the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument.
Let us remember that the main objective of this report is to avoid the emergence of new dividing lines, or worse, splits, between the enlarged European Union and its immediate geographical neighbours, but also to enhance the stability and security of the area under consideration as a whole.
Spreading peace is an oft-repeated desire but one that, very often, is hindered along the way by the reality of hatred and intolerance.
Consequently, the proper functioning of this policy determines, in part, Europe's international geopolitical standing.
How can we effectively review this neighbourhood and partnership instrument?
The main point can be summed up by just one word: ambition.
More ambition, indeed, in dialogues with civil society and local authorities, to enhance their involvement in the conception and control of the implementation of this instrument.
More ambition in aid support, with the aim of enhancing administrative, local and regional capabilities in neighbouring countries and, also, of promoting exchange programmes for civil society.
More ambition in the areas of democracy, the rule of law and human rights.
This budget support, however, must be subject to a selection process so as to make it accessible only to those who can make use of it, with a country-specific approach, under political conditionality, without forgetting to improve evaluation of policies.
It is also imperative to clarify the relationship between European neighbourhood policy, a framework policy par excellence, and regional initiatives, such as the Black Sea Synergy, the Union for the Mediterranean, and the future Eastern Partnership.
Indeed, by reducing policies to increasingly limited geographical areas, we run the risk of losing the overall direction, visibility and transparency of the neighbourhood policy that the European Union wants to pursue.
That is the price at which we will enhance the Union's cohesion and synchronisation, our dedicated budget will be deployed, comprehensively, in the desired directions, and the European Union will, at last, fully assume its role as a centre of stability.
<D>
President of the Court of Auditors. - (DE) Mr President, I had already left the chamber when this question was asked.
Needless to say, I should like to clarify the matter.
It was alleged that, in a BBC interview, I had sided with Mrs Andreasen.
I can tell you that I certainly did give an interview to the BBC, but the name Andreasen was not even mentioned in it.
Two of my staff who are here can testify to that.
Another particularly important point is that I am supposed to have said that 80% of expenditure had got the red light, if I may express it in these simple terms.
I actually said the exact opposite.
The interviewer, who is free, of course, in the way he chooses to present things, asked me whether I had a problem with Mr Kallas's statement to the effect that 40% of expenditure had been given the green light.
I replied that I had no problem with it.
I say this to make it clear that there is no difference between Mr Kallas's perception and my own.
One can always argue about percentages.
This one might even be higher than 40%, but I must reaffirm that the figure 80 did not pass my lips.
I did not make any reference to Mrs Andreasen, because the issue is between the Commission and Mrs Andreasen, and the Court has no wish to interfere in that.
Thank you very much for giving me this opportunity to respond.
<D>
(SL) So far, I have endorsed all of the European Parliament's reports charting Croatia's progress on its way to fully-fledged membership of the European Union.
I salute Croatia's many new achievements on this occasion, too.
I will be happy to endorse this important report, which has been painstakingly prepared by my fellow member Mr Swoboda, as well, provided that the compromise amendments reflect a balanced and realistic approach.
That is the only kind of approach that can eliminate the causes of the obstacles and speed up the process of Croatia's accession.
I fully agree with the President-in-Office, Mr Vondra, when he says that we need a constructive and dynamic approach.
In this context, it seems important to me that, following a string of unsuccessful bilateral attempts, the European Commission has now, with its mediation initiative, offered an opportunity for a new and credible attempt to be made to reach a final resolution of the problem of the border between Slovenia and Croatia and, by the same token, to make rapid progress in accession negotiations with Croatia.
I am pleased to note that both countries have been receptive to the initiative and that talks have commenced at a high level.
I hope that the initiative will bring us much closer to a threefold victory: a victory for Croatia, Slovenia and the European Union.
We cannot allow only one party to be the winner or only one viewpoint to prevail: we can only win if we work on the basis of common objectives and common will.
Likewise, I agree with the rapporteur, Mr Swoboda, when he says that we need to observe the principle of equity, which is part of international law.
I also fully agree with the Commissioner, Mr Rehn, that a suitable point of departure for the settlement of the border dispute is the United Nations Charter and that the Commission's initiative reflects the spirit of the Charter.
It is time for the negotiating table to take centre stage, without any rhetoric or pressures which might injure either party's dignity or Croatia's accession status.
We need a positive atmosphere.
I firmly believe that we have only one positive solution in prospect, one that Slovenia and Croatia will agree on under the mediation of a third party, i.e. the European Commission.
I would like to see this happen as soon as possible.
<D>
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Rack, on his report.
If the 80% of people who live in cities would adopt the recommended measures on the culture of urban mobility, life would become much better and healthier for everyone.
This is a good example of the way in which the EU takes care of its citizens.
We need to expand the public transport and bicycle route network and encourage the use of more environmentally friendly means of transport.
However, the most important and most difficult task is to change people's habits.
For example, in Lithuania around 50% of all car journeys are less than a kilometre.
Even young and healthy people forget they have legs and that the bicycle has already been invented.
With the Commission's help we should be able to find different financial levers to eliminate or reduce the traffic jams that paralyse the life of cities and their inhabitants.
It is either movement, mobility, or suffocation among iron monsters, spitting out pollutants.
<D>
(PL) Madam President, I congratulate all three rapporteurs on their excellent, constructive reports.
The introduction of goods into circulation on the territory of the Union is without doubt a very serious issue.
We all remember the recent problems caused by the introduction of unsafe toys into the EU market.
Those toys were not discovered by the EU control authorities since, as in many other cases, the monitoring system proved ineffective.
It happens more and more frequently that manufacturers affix the CE mark to their products without any control, despite the fact that the goods in question do not meet EU criteria.
Moreover, the CE mark is repeatedly counterfeited.
These and other reasons lie behind the Commission's proposed package on the introduction of goods into the EU market.
I would like to make a point concerning one of the three components of this package: Mr Brie's report on accreditation and market surveillance.
The issue of the CE mark dealt with in this report seems to me of particularly importance.
I am pleased that Members have taken a position in support of the CE mark as a major guarantee of compliance with EU standards and - most important of all - that they are in favour of strengthening its position.
An important issue discussed in this connection has been the problem of other national marks existing in the EU market.
I would like to point out here that, in joining the EU, Poland was told repeatedly that it was not to incorporate the safety marks of other countries into its national system.
We complied with this instruction, even going so far as to eliminate our own B mark, which was the Polish symbol of product safety.
So it was important for us that the EU approach be followed and the principle of non-discrimination be respected in the new legislation through the inclusion of a prohibition on the introduction of new safety marks other than CE.
I am very pleased to see that the Council, the Commission and Parliament have stuck to this position by deleting the relevant clauses and maintaining the status quo.
I nevertheless consider that we should work together on the European CE mark with a view to removing other marks from the market in the longer term, although an initiative to that end will have to wait until the Commission has looked into the matter.
<D>
(ES) Mr President, thank you very much.
Ladies and gentlemen, on 13 April Ennaama Asfari, a human rights defender in the Western Sahara, was arrested in Marrakech.
Yet another arrest in Morocco.
I am telling you this, ladies and gentlemen, in order to say that we should not forget that the European Union is responsible for the decolonisation process backed by the United Nations.
We are responsible, and therefore any human rights report must say that the European Union should be exacting and vigilant and must comply with UN Security Council resolutions.
Secondly, ladies and gentlemen, we are in a civilisation, in the 21st century, in which the population is getting poorer and hungrier, and there is more disease and more inequality.
In the last ten years, according to the United Nations, Africa has become poorer.
I would therefore like to demand, suggest, and ask that it be recognised that human rights means all rights: economic, social, cultural and political rights.
If we had a scale, we would be very surprised to see the ranking of countries that do not respect human rights.
I therefore think that we should have much greater awareness and raise all issues of compliance with human rights.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, some weeks ago, as you remember, we discussed the contribution of taxation and customs policies to the Lisbon Strategy of growth, jobs and competitiveness.
Cross-border loss relief is one key element for establishing a competitive internal market without obstacles and thus contributing to growth and employment.
Let me explain the importance of granting cross-border loss relief for the internal market.
Imagine a small or medium-sized enterprise which is operating successfully in its domestic market.
Once it plans to expand its operation to other Member States, to the internal market, it will not only run into problems regarding additional compliance costs.
Thus, in many cases, this SME will not be able to set off any start-up losses against profits which it may continue to generate in its Member State of residence.
The non-consideration of foreign losses results in double taxation and discourages many SMEs from investing in other Member States.
With the new initiative on cross-border loss relief, large enterprises - but also SMEs in particular - could more easily extend their activities abroad and enjoy the full benefits of the internal market.
The initiative on cross-border loss relief constitutes a targeted solution in the short to medium term and represents an intermediary step.
But please note that this initiative could in the future be complementary to the common consolidated corporate tax base (CCTB), notably for companies that are not covered by the CCTB.
The initiative on cross-border loss relief is more limited in scope than the consolidation of the tax base under the CCTB would be, as this provides automatic and comprehensive off-setting of all profits and losses within a group of companies.
I highly appreciate the strong support expressed in Ms Kauppi's report for the Commission's initiative in the field of cross-border loss relief, for the coordination approach and of course also for our work on the CCTB.
Like you, I am persuaded that we should continue our efforts to dismantle tax barriers in the internal market.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, of course, I too would like to wish Mr Bonde personally all the best for the future.
Nonetheless, I think it is rather a pity that he felt compelled to repeat his frequent comments about the institutions during this important debate on Latin America, because the subject of Latin America is important in itself.
That is borne out by the figures quoted by Mr Schulz.
One third of the members of the United Nations will be meeting in Lima.
Between us, we represent a billion people and if we can reach agreement, we can have a positive influence on the world's development.
In light of globalisation and the challenges we face, notably in relation to China or indeed other countries, it is essential for Latin America and Europe to work together.
Climate change will be an important topic, and the resolutions rightly state that it is the poor who will be hardest hit by climate change.
I can speak from experience here: I myself am involved in the work of a small NGO in Central America, and what the people suffered there as a result of Hurricane Mitch and Hurricane Stan is just a small foretaste of what we can expect if we do not get climate change under control.
It is good that we agree on so many points here.
There are some points, however, on which we do not yet agree.
Here in the House, we voted by a large majority in favour of the inclusion of aviation in emissions trading.
Vice-President Barrot is aware of this and has expressed himself in very critical terms on this subject.
The rest of the world has attempted to block this move via the ICAO, and unfortunately that includes Latin America.
I think this must be a topic for discussion in Lima.
If we want to work together to combat climate change, the Latin American countries must also play a constructive role.
Finally, may I say a few words about Cuba.
Mr Schulz has said that we should not pursue the same policy as Mr Bush, but we have never done that.
We have never applied the kind of economic sanctions - sanctions that affect the Cuban people - that America has imposed.
What we have done, in the past, is to make it a priority to ensure that our partners, the democratic opposition, feature in the dialogue.
Oswaldo Payá and the Damas de Blanco have been awarded the Sakharov Prize and we cannot simply revert to 'business as usual' if the Damas de Blanco have still not been able to receive it and, as occurred only last weekend, some of them have been arrested again.
We should not forget about our partners in the dialogue with Cuba.
<D>
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PL) Mr President, Commissioner, I fully support all those who have appealed for this job to be seen through to the end and for justice to de dispensed in Sierra Leone.
This simply must happen.
The perpetrators of crimes cannot be allowed to believe that they will enjoy impunity, regardless of where they may reside, be it in Europe, in Africa or in any other part of the world.
I should, however, like to take this opportunity to highlight a particular problem, which I believe to be very significant.
We are witnessing a proliferation of courts established by the United Nations, a kind of mushrooming of criminal courts.
An International Criminal Court was set up in Rome.
An International Criminal Tribunal to deal with the crimes that took place in the former Yugoslavia was also set up, and another to deal with the crimes committed in Rwanda.
Now we have the Special Court for Sierra Leone.
I appreciate that all these courts are necessary, but if they are to be established their funding must be guaranteed from the outset.
That is a sine qua non.
I therefore call on the Commissioner to raise the matter of financing such institutions at the forthcoming EU-Africa summit, due to take place before the end of this year.
These institutions are necessary and must be properly funded.
It is embarrassing to have to discuss sums of this nature.
<D>
in writing. - (PT) The economic difficulties faced by the fishing industry are the result of an unclear and inefficient system, which is based, inter alia, on the system of TACs (Total Allowable Catch), quotas and management of fishing effort.
The Commission communication on 'improving the economic situation in the fishing industry' mentions the difficulties faced by the industry and identifies some new approaches for fisheries management.
These include management of 'fishing rights'.
This debate is extremely important to the Community fishing industry as it opens the door to greater biological sustainability of resources and more opportunity for those responsible for the industry to intervene in the market.
There is a wide variety of fishing rights and transaction systems that are not always totally transparent.
We must therefore engage in serious debate so that ways of managing these rights, which are capable of ensuring transparency, legal certainty and economic efficiency for fishermen, can be assessed.
As fishing rights form the backbone of fisheries management in the leading countries in terms of fishing potential (US, New Zealand, Norway, etc.), it is totally appropriate to discuss this possibility in the Community's fisheries management.
Due to all the above, the Members of the Portuguese Social Democratic Party support the Attwooll report.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I have followed with interest the discussion on cancer and I must say once again that cancer is not something which is temporarily on our agenda: it is something which is so serious for the whole of the European Union - and not only - that we cannot be complacent and it will always be among our priorities.
I have been described as an expert on cancer.
I must say that I am not an expert on cancer.
There are people here who are really experts on cancer, but I am a person who has worked for many years in the fight against cancer and I will remain as such.
I have heard very interesting comments.
I will try to answer some of them, but rest assured that I have taken note of all the comments that were made, and we shall include them in our deliberations when we formulate our action plan.
Concerning Structural Funds, the Commission has now included health as one of the priority areas for funding, so the funds can be used for health infrastructure, including cancer.
Mention was made of carcinogens in the workplace.
We already have strong European standards, as you know, on health and safety.
The Commission will, of course, work to keep those standards updated as science updates our knowledge of risks.
I will work on this with Commissioner Špidla, who is responsible for this area of legislation.
The suggestion was made repeatedly concerning the setting-up of an interinstitutional task force to fight cancer.
I would examine this during the deliberations of the forthcoming Health Council in Slovenia, and I would also make another addition to this suggestion: that I would like to see representatives of patients and of professionals included in this task force.
Recognition of oncology as a specialisation is something that is, indeed, very necessary, but I would point out that this is something for the Member States to do.
But, as far as I am concerned, I will exert all my influence in encouraging Member States to do so.
Many speakers spoke about anti-smoking campaigns.
We all know that smoking is one of the most serious detriments to health, and my intention is not only to continue the campaign against smoking but also to try to involve youth in this campaign, not only to make it less trendy for them but also to make them understand that it is to their benefit not to start smoking, and make them involved actively in the campaign so that the word is spread among young people, because that is the first stage to prevent smoking - to start with the young people.
As I said, many other interesting proposals have been made.
I will take all of them into consideration, and I will continue to work closely with Members of Parliament in reaching a very good action plan for next year.
(Applause)

(EL) Mr President, we heard earlier about the concerns of the Greek people over the question of Olympic Airlines.
We must ensure that Olympic stays airborne.
However, there is another problem which concerns the Greek people, and it was discussed in the Greek Parliament on the initiative of the Vice-President (First Speaker), Mr Sourlas: the serious risk posed to young people by the use of technologies and computers.
Dependence on this new phenomenon causes illnesses in young people which make them unfit to participate in society, destroying their prospects for education or work.
At the same time, no safeguards are provided.
Our question, then, is: Why does free competition on the open market allow the production and import of video games from third countries, and the dissemination of such games, and the uncontrolled, 24-hour operation of Internet cafes?
How can this market be controlled?
What is the European subsidy for providing a safe internet for young people?
What measures are being taken to treat the illnesses which young people suffer because of their addiction to computers and the Internet?
And how are the competent law-enforcement authorities controlling electronic crime at European level?
<D>
President of the Eurogroup. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Berès, Mr Langen, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating your two rapporteurs on the report they have submitted to you and to us, since we are reading it and we are debating it.
This report is fair and goes far enough to ensure that we will be kept busy during the coming months.
I agree with the analysis made in Mrs Berès's and Mr Langen's report on the assessment of the first ten years of the single currency.
There is nothing to add or to remove from what they have expressed in their report.
Furthermore, it is a report that has the support of a large majority within this House, at least where the Commission has expressed its opinion on it.
I note that the House's enthusiasm for the single currency is far more pronounced today than it was 12 or 13 years ago, even 10 years ago, and we should be pleased about that.
With regard to the economic divergences, the deltas between structural reforms and the differences in terms of the management of public finances, I should like first of all to point out that I did not understand what the report meant when it said that the results do not live up to the expectations that existed at the time of the introduction of the single currency.
I know of no quantitative report on the divergences between the various Member States of the Euro Zone.
Given that this report does not exist, it is therefore a circumstantial comment, which I did not understand.
I do share the view that these divergences tend at times to increase, something which, until now, has not threatened the cohesion of the Euro Zone but, were this divergence to persist, could harm its cohesion in the long term.
For the rest, and in this regard, we should be pleased that Europe - the European Union in general and the Eurogroup in particular - which is today faced with one of the most serious crises that it has had to tackle over the past few decades, has competently managed the crisis in which we currently find ourselves, not least by avoiding making the mistakes that were made in Europe during the 1970s.
To say that we have not repeated the same mistakes is no small thing, for economically and politically, this has enabled us to prevent the crisis from increasing the divergences within the monetary Union and from helping to undermine its cohesion.
The fact is, in the face of a crisis of the size that we are experiencing and in the face of a crisis that is increasingly extending to the real economy, a strong and coordinated economic policy response at European level is necessary, and we need to reflect on the best way of organising it by taking account, on the one hand, of our conceptual and regulatory framework - I am referring here to the Stability and Growth Pact and to the Lisbon Strategy - and, on the other, of the seriousness of the crisis, the consequences of which are far graver than we imagined a few months ago.
The creation of the world's second major currency certainly brings advantages, but it also entails obligations, with the G20 of last Friday and Saturday in Washington reminding us of the obligations of ourselves and others.
We have to use and make the most of the three weeks we have before the December European Council in order to skilfully hone our European strategy and to prevent disparate responses at national level.
These disparate responses threaten us, of course.
It moves me to hear the calls and renewed calls for economic policy coordination that are mainly expressed in the language of Voltaire.
I should like those who are calling for the coordination of economic policies first and foremost to set an example and demonstrate the sincerity of their words.
I note that the various governments of the various member countries of the Euro Zone are pouncing greedily, and justifiably, on the problems being faced by their countries' automobile sector.
I should like those who talk about the automobile sector and who continually talk about the coordination of economic policies to coordinate their national actions when it comes to taking initiatives in the automobile sector.
The rest is of trifling importance.
Really coordinate and prove, with an example to hand, the sincerity of those words.
(Applause)
With regard to monetary policy, you know how timid I am, I would never utter a word about it, except to say that I continue to believe that the role played by the European Central Bank over the last few months was truly exemplary.
Integration and supervision of the financial markets - that is another area of considerations that your rapporteurs have covered in their report.
The G20 has set us an ambitious road map; it must be translated into concrete action by the G20, and hence by the European Union and by the members of the Eurogroup.
You will no doubt recall that the member countries of the Eurogroup and those of the European Union were the first to demand that appropriate lessons be learnt from the crisis we are facing, and I do not wish to save my memories of that episode for a later date.
For four years we - I am talking about those in charge of the Eurogroup - have kept on repeating to the Japanese and US ministers of finance and have kept on drawing the attention of our US friends both to the risks of their double deficit and to the risks created by systematically underestimating the risks, especially with regard to real estate.
For two years several of us, at G7 level and in particular under the German Presidency of the G7, demanded, with a certain bluntness of tone, more extensive regulation of the financial markets.
I do not take kindly to the fact that those who rejected this in the past are today giving the impression of leading the European response.
The US and UK Governments had all the time they needed to accept the Eurogroup's proposals on better regulation of the financial markets; they did not wish to do so.
They should not give the impression today that they are leading the others.
On the enlargement of the Euro Zone, I have nothing to say that differs from what your rapporteurs said.
I would simply point out that, belonging to the Euro Zone is, of course, an advantage, an opportunity, but that it also entails obligations of which some will have to be met before accession to the Euro Zone is possible.
This entirely understandable enthusiasm for the new formation of the G7 does, however, cause problems concerning the external representation of the Euro Zone.
We have always appealed, within the Eurogroup, for the European Union and the Eurogroup to have a greater presence at the G20, at the International Monetary Fund and at the Financial Stability Fund.
We, at the Eurogroup, were the first to demand a lasting and permanent seat for the Commission at the G20, something that did not prevent the President of the Commission from not claiming the Presidency of the Eurogroup - the consequences of which we shall see later.
However, we believe that the European Central Bank and the Commission should be represented on a long-term basis at the G20, as should the Eurogroup, whether it be represented by the President of the Eurogroup, who is modestly trying to lead the finance ministers' work, to which Mr Sarkozy commented that they were unequal, or by someone else.
I am not seeking the Presidency of the Eurogroup at minister of finance level for my own pleasure and glory, which is hardly inexhaustible; I am doing so out of a sense of duty.
If others think that they can do a better job of these tasks, then let them do so, but they should apply the same intensity to them in the years to come as they give the impression of wanting to do at the present time.
For the rest, with regard to the EMU's economic instruments and the governance of our group, I believe that, over the last few years, we have made remarkable progress, but when we debate exchange policy and monetary policy at international level, it is unthinkable that the world's second major currency should not be represented in political and monetary terms by those responsible for managing these two aspects and these two areas of our common policy.
If we want the ministers of finance within the Eurogroup properly to manage the economic strand of Economic and Monetary Union, then the various Heads of State or Government need to give their ministers of finance the necessary instructions.
In Luxembourg, as you know, this presents no problem whatsoever.
(Applause)
<D>
in writing. - (NL) The CAP 'health check' is an extensive and important area.
Whether we like it or not, we indicate the course which agricultural policy should take after 2013.
Allow me to mention two aspects in this respect.
Decoupled support allows for more market-oriented, and therefore more competitive and more innovative agriculture, but we should not veer the other way to a fully liberalised agricultural market.
We should not throw away the umbrella the minute the sun appears.
Intervention mechanisms, insurance cover and so on should be organised in such a way as not to distort the market, and should, at the same time, be a real safety net.
The proposals to channel considerable amounts to the second pillar via modulation do not receive my support.
It appears that the funds in the first pillar are spent more wisely than the rural development funds.
Moreover, I foresee all kinds of cofinancing problems in relation to a level playing field.
<D>
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I believe that Alejo Vidal-Quadras, a good friend of mine, and others who have spoken are profoundly mistaken and that we should support the amendments, because the Iraqi Government has announced on more than one occasion recently that it has no intention whatsoever of forcing the inhabitants of Camp Ashraf to leave for Iran or to go to any other country.
The Iraqi Government has repeatedly requested different countries, including many EU Member States, to receive them, and we have not agreed.
Of the 3 400 people living in the camp, 1 015 hold residence permits from, and enjoy resident status in, different countries, many of which are EU Member States, and we are not accepting these people.
Why?
Most of the camp's inhabitants received professional military training during the previous Saddam Hussein regime and they participated with his presidential guards and with other security forces in the violent crushing of the Iraqi people's popular uprising after the liberation of Kuwait in 1991.
There is ample evidence that these people harmed the Iraqi people when the Iraqi army refused to carry out the killings that Saddam Hussein required.
The families of the victims in Iraq cannot forget this fact, and the Iraqi Constitution does not permit the presence of groups such as the NKO or the PKK on Iraqi soil.
Two thousand of these people have registered themselves with the High Commissioner for Refugees, hoping to be transferred to other countries ready to accept them, and for several years now the Iraqi Government has been working closely with UNHCR asking other countries to accept them.
Dear colleagues, this is the business of Iraq.
The sovereignty of Iraq is at stake, and we should place our trust in this democratically elected Government of Iraq.
This is their right, their duty, and I can assure you they are fulfilling it correctly.
<D>
in writing. - (PT) We are pleased at the adoption of our proposals that:
maintain that the double-checking surveillance system will serve no purpose unless it prevents any repetition of the situation that occurred in 2005 and that new safeguard measures are required;
repeat the proposal that a Community programme should be drawn up for the textiles and clothing sector, especially for the more disadvantaged regions that depend on it, and help for SMEs;
We regret the rejection by the majority of the European Parliament of our proposals that, for example:
referred to the serious consequences of liberalisation in the textiles and clothing sector at global level with firms closing down or relocating, unemployment and serious socio-economic crises;
pointed out that some countries have adopted safeguard measures applying until the end of 2008, and therefore failed to understand why the EU had not followed suit;
maintain that a regulatory framework needed to be laid down to penalise company relocations, making public aid to businesses subject to long-term commitments regarding regional development and employment, including the requirement to pay back aid if such conditions were not met;
called for a stronger role for workers' representatives in company boards and in fundamental organisational decision-making.
<D>
- (LV) Madam President, Mr Vondra, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, those who have studied history in Europe, the majority I believe, know that the Second World War began on 1 September 1939, when Hitler invaded Poland.
A much smaller number of people know that Hitler was able to do this because on 23 August 1939 he and Stalin had signed an agreement: a non-aggression pact.
Even fewer people know that for two years Stalin's regime supplied Hitler and Hitler's army with fuel and industrial materials so that Hitler could conquer Western Europe.
Even fewer people know that for the whole of the 1930s offensive weapons, tanks and parachutists had been prepared for Stalin.
While Hitler had 400 parachutists ready, Stalin had prepared 1 million parachutists, ready to conquer.
Furthermore, this foreign policy had been supported in the decisions of the Communist Bolshevik party of the Soviet Union.
In various closed sessions of the Communist party, resolutions were passed to the effect that the countries of Western Europe should be set at loggerheads so that the Soviet Union would then be able to liberate them.
There is still more: in relation to domestic policy, on 5 December 1937 those Latvians who had remained living in Soviet Russia began to be arrested and exterminated in their entirety.
Over a two-year period, 70 000 Latvians living in the Soviet Union were killed solely because they were Latvians.
So, how should we refer to this regime, where foreign policy was aggressive, and where domestic policy was directed towards exterminating the country's own residents?
It was a totalitarian, criminal regime, just like Nazism.
Thank you.
<D>
(NL) Just two points.
I have no problem at all in supporting this resolution.
But of course we all know that Russia is too important a supplier of energy and so the European heads of state and government will put this piece of paper quietly to one side.
We know from experience that once economic interests are at stake, whether in China, Russia or Saudi Arabia, the passion for human rights of all these authors of fundamental rights charters must yield to Realpolitik.
So let us be under no illusions.
Secondly, ladies and gentlemen, replace 'Russia' in this resolution with 'Belgium' and the text remains every bit as relevant.
Because it is not so long ago that in Belgium too, police were incited to beat up peaceful demonstrators on orders from the mayor of Brussels.
In Belgium too, the opposition is to a large extent denied access to the media.
In Belgium too, politically appointed judges banned an opposition party at the request of the government, at the request too of the party of which the Commissioner, here with us today, is a member.
And the judges in question were promoted as a result.
Let's see Europe clean up its own act first and deal with these sham democrats.
<D>
President of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all, a word of thanks to the Spanish Presidency.
The Spanish Presidency has accomplished a very difficult task at an exceptional moment in the European Union.
I think it is fair to recognise their commitment and their European conviction in times of crisis.
Through Minister López Garrido, I want to convey to the Spanish Government my sincere thanks for all the relevant contributions he has been making, especially during this six months, for our common European project.
Ahead of tomorrow's European Council, I would like to draw some lessons from the past few months and set out the direction that I believe the European Union needs to take.
In the last few months, we have taken decisions which would have been difficult to imagine just a few months ago.
We succeeded in reinventing our economic response to meet urgent needs in a way that respects our most cherished principles: solidarity and responsibility.
So we were able to bring support to our fellow Europeans in Greece, in the framework of a mechanism that contains the necessary rules and obligations.
It took some time but the system is now in place.
Both the system itself, and the European Union, have proved equal to the task.
Moreover, we are also succeeding in designing a crisis response for the euro.
This was a major effort, accomplished in a very short time and unmatched anywhere in the world.
With this European mechanism and this European facility that together amount to EUR 500 billion, supplemented by EUR 250 billion from the IMF, we have ensured that we can face any further difficulty, should such a difficulty arise.
This was uncharted territory, but the European Union has been doing what is necessary to address the risks to financial stability.
And, although those who like to speak loudly about Europe's problems are reluctant to admit it, this is the reality: when action is needed, provided the political will of the Member States is there, we are able to take up the challenge.
Moreover, we have not stopped at short-term stabilisation.
We have embarked on a far-reaching exercise of fiscal consolidation and modernisation of our budgetary and economic surveillance.
I hope the European Council will give backing to the Commission's proposals to strengthen fiscal discipline and macro-economic surveillance which, in the meantime, have been constructively discussed in the task force led by President Van Rompuy.
We have started to deliver on our Europe 2020 strategy for growth and jobs.
In other words, we are adding dynamism to the economy, for instance, through the digital agenda, in addition to the stabilisation and consolidation efforts.
We are striving to avoid a decade of debt and build a generation of growth.
In fact, the potential growth of the European Union has been severely affected by the last financial crisis, so the most important priority now is growth.
Growth is the answer, but not any kind of growth.
We need intelligent, sustainable and inclusive growth.
I want to underline this last point - inclusive growth, because I think it would not be fair that the most vulnerable in our societies, those who were not the cause of this crisis, will be those who have to pay much more during this crisis.
For this growth to happen, we need fiscal consolidation and structural reform.
It is obvious that, without serious efforts in these areas, confidence will not come back and without confidence, we cannot have growth.
So, in fact, we now have the opportunity to go further in our economic policy efforts.
We have to advance on several fronts at once and this is a most important lesson to come out of this crisis.
In fact, faced with the problem with monetary union, the result should not be going back on our monetary union, but should be going further in economic union.
This is the important point.
We need a real effort for an economic union in Europe.
That is why there is a holistic approach combining several instruments: of course, fiscal consolidation and structural reform, but also sectoral reform for growth.
That is why the Europe 2020 strategy places at its heart the elements of growth - intelligent, sustainable and inclusive growth.
But this is not the whole programme.
The programme is about growth but also in terms of structural reforms, financial reform and the new economic governance for Europe.
Yesterday, during the Question Hour, I had the opportunity to discuss this issue of economic governance.
I will not go into detail now but I want to say that we are committed to using this opportunity to reinforce economic governance at European level.
Tomorrow's European Council should signal to people that we have a new perspective for growth with the Europe 2020 strategy.
But I believe that agreeing the strategy, including the targets - and I am happy that now, a consensus appears to have been built around the targets, including the targets of achieving a greater degree of social inclusion - is, relatively, the easier part.
Where we really need to invest and work together is on the delivery, year after year.
The Commission will play its full role, using all the possibilities offered by the Lisbon Treaty, and I look forward to discussing this in more detail with the European Parliament.
People also need to see that financial markets are actually being repaired and that promises are kept.
We need agreement on financial supervision before the summer to back up our intentions with action, and we need a clear signal from the European Council that the Commission's forthcoming proposals on financial market regulation will be adopted by the end of 2011.
It is important not to lose momentum on financial reform.
We must also show that the crisis has not dimmed our commitment to the Millennium Development Goals or our determination to lead on climate change.
This Parliament has given the Commission full support for an ambitious European approach.
Europe played a key role in shaping the global response to the crisis.
It was the EU that pushed for the G20 to become the global forum for economic recovery.
Now we need the summit in Toronto to reinforce the message that the G20 remains committed.
That does not mean that we all face the same challenges or must respond in the same way, but what we all know is that none of those problems can be effectively tackled at home without a collective response at international level.
I have explained in my letter to the European Council what should be the three key areas in Toronto.
First, to agree common principles for exit strategies in terms of fiscal consolidation.
We have already done this at European level, but a global approach would help the many economies around the world facing the same challenge.
Second, the world needs to be working on developing new sources for growth, as we are advocating internally.
All the major economies need to play their part to achieve the agreed objectives of strong, balanced, sustainable growth.
Coordination at global level is critical for optimising growth prospects.
We need both the supply and demand side, worldwide, to spur productivity and unleash the potential for growth.
A strong message here would be a big boost to confidence globally, namely I think we should keep in mind that trade can be - and should be - one of the elements to spur new sources of growth.
We also need to drive forward the global agenda for financial reform and repair.
2010 is the crucial year for implementing what the G20 has already agreed, and for keeping the momentum for further reforms.
This means improving both the quantity and quality of bank capital and discouraging excessive leverage, improving supervisory and crisis management processes, ensuring convergent international accounting standards, and increasing the transparency of derivative markets.
We cannot be seen to be stepping back from reforms or from ensuring that the financial sector and those who work in it are playing their full part in these efforts.
This is why I will continue to call for a common framework for a bank levy at global level.
It is only fair that the financial sector, where irresponsible behaviour triggered this crisis, makes a contribution to solving the crisis.
As I have said before, I am personally convinced that we will also need to work on a financial transaction tax or a financial activities tax.
The situation is serious and, in fact, extremely challenging.
Wages are being cut.
Unemployment remains very high.
The pressure on people, especially the most vulnerable, is intense.
At the European Council and the G20 summit, we must show that Europe is part of the solution.
We are facing a very difficult moment - in fact, one of the most difficult moments in recent history - but, by tackling these difficulties, we are laying the foundations for a better future.
Once again, we can see that a crisis can accelerate decision making when it crystallises political will.
Solutions that seemed out of reach only a few years or even months ago are now possible.
As the history of European construction reminds us, it is usually in times of crisis like this that we can make progress in the European project.
The reality is that Member States are now ready to accept some proposals that some years ago, or even some months ago, were simply not acceptable, and I can give you a lot of concrete examples.
So, if we keep our commitment to give the facts to our citizens, to work with our Member States and to explain that we need Europe more than ever, I think this crisis can be a platform for a common European response and for a stronger Europe.
Of course, the game is not over.
It is an extremely delicate moment, and that is why I would like to thank Parliament for its steadfast support for the strengthening of the Community method at this point in time.
I would like especially to thank the most important political forces in Parliament that stood up and said that, more than ever, we need a European approach and the reinforcement of the Community method.
We sometimes have the reflex to look for new institutions and structures when a problem emerges, but the reality is the Community method has stood the test of time because it is more adaptable than some might think.
I believe that Europeans want us to concentrate on substance.
They do not want more divisive discussions about institutions or processes.
They want results.
This is also what the rest of the world is expecting from us.
In fact, we are at a specific moment in time where Europeans, the markets and the global community are asking Europe to be better coordinated and better organised to achieve greater levels of convergence and coherence.
This is why I think we need to work through the institutions that we have and use them to their full potential.
This House has repeatedly emphasised the central role of the Commission.
Yes, the Commission, in the areas in which the treaties give it the competence, is indeed the economic government of Europe.
The Commission, which is fully accountable to the European Parliament, exercises this role in cooperation with the European Council and the Council of Ministers, in respect of their competences.
This is not only about European Union competences.
We also need a better coordination on issues under national competence.
It is in such a spirit of cooperation that we can help the Member States to chart the way forward.
Let me be clear: this is not about a Brussels power grab.
This is not a new round in the debate over the division of powers.
Today's task is to add value - European value - through the vigorous, responsible and complementary exercise of our respective roles.
The European Union will do it in full respect of the Community method and reinforcing a European response.
You can count on the Commission to fully assume its responsibilities.
We are doing our job.
We count on the decisive input and support of Parliament.
(Applause)
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Madam President, Commissioners, firstly I should like to thank the rapporteurs, the Commission and the institutions, especially the French Presidency.
They have worked hard to reach this compromise, which strikes a balance between human health and agricultural production.
As far as farmers are concerned, harmonising the systems of the three zones will make it easier to access the products, and a fund for minor uses, as envisaged and guaranteed by the Commission, will mean that we have products placed on the market that are designed for minor cultivation and gardening purposes.
We therefore have a guarantee that, by 2020, all substances with a proven harmful effect, such as CMRs and endocrine disrupters, will no longer be authorised to be placed on the market.
It follows that this proposal should significantly reduce the diseases and the many types of cancers for which a link to pesticides has already been scientifically proven, together with the degenerative diseases whose effects have also been proven.
One very important aspect that should be pointed out is that every effort will now be made to ensure better compliance with bee protection measures.
The Commission has just made a declaration on this point.
I should like to know, however, whether the Commission will reconsider Directive 2007/52 under the aspects it has just listed.
Emphasis will also be placed on biological control methods and, in this field, this research, which has been supported and financed by the Commission, still needs to be marketed effectively.
Moreover I am confident that this text will serve as a welcome and necessary incentive to stimulate research and innovation among the major producers of conventional chemical pesticides.
With regard to the Commission, the report provides for interim reports, meaning that we have a guarantee that monitoring will take place.
I hope that the national bodies will also do their best to prove that this is a valid text.
<D>
We voted against the report on amending the conditions of employment of assistants to MEPs.
We have absolutely nothing against ensuring that assistants in the European Parliament have reasonable salaries and working conditions.
However, we have no more desire to transfer MEPs' assistants to the 'EU tax haven' than we had to transfer MEPs to a pay system within the EU with a favourable EU tax.
Both MEPs and their assistants must be rooted in the realities of their own country.
Pay and benefits must be linked to the conditions in their Member States or, in the case of the assistants, to the conditions in the place where they live and work.
Neither MEPs nor their assistants should be isolated in an 'EU bubble' with high salaries and attractive benefits way above the reality experienced by the citizens they are supposed to represent.
We therefore voted against this proposal for an EU statute for assistants.
For us, it is a matter of principle that has nothing to do with the financial conditions for assistants as such.
<D>
- (CS) Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the fact that women in the European Union must work almost two months longer in order to earn as much as men is more than alarming.
Even though Europe is dying, all we can do here is to state that wage discrimination against women and families with children persists up to the rate of 25%, although women have now surpassed men in educational attainment at a ratio of 60:40.
Mrs Bauer has noted that in the so-called male professions the work of women is routinely undervalued for no objective reason.
However, if the reason is the lack of working years that women devote instead to caring for their families, we must give the matter some serious thought.
Families should not be a handicap.
Mrs Bauer is making waves and her arguments for starting on a review of anti-discrimination laws are convincing.
I also support the proposal that access to public tenders and projects financed from EU funds should be made conditional upon a given company being able to demonstrate an anti-discriminatory pay policy.
I believe this is the way to change the gender stereotypes of employers, especially in the private sector.
I would like to thank the rapporteur for a highly professional report.
<D>
in writing. - (DE) I am voting in favour of the report on aerodromes, air traffic management and air navigation services.
Air traffic management has been included in the common transport policy since 2004 on the basis of the Single European Sky Regulation.
Following enlargement, the European aviation market has grown to 37 countries and has made the EU a global player.
An update to reflect this was therefore urgently needed.
The second report in the package extends the scope by harmonising controls of aerodromes and their operators.
Austrian aerodromes also come under this new rule.
What is positive, precisely in times of economic crisis, is that a series of proposed amendments in Parliament allows advance payments for infrastructure investments where other sources of investment are available in addition to user fees and under strict conditions.
This will help significantly in seeing us through this economic crisis.
<D>
The natural disaster that affected Madeira on 20 February has left a desolate scene, human suffering and widespread destruction, with devastating consequences for the respective economic and production structures.
One week later, another natural disaster - storm Xynthia - had devastating consequences on a region in western France and several regions of Spain.
I would like to join with the feeling of grief and express my solidarity with all those affected by this tragedy, in terms of both the human and material losses.
It is vital to provide aid to people, as well as to rebuild infrastructure, public facilities and essential services.
It is true that the Solidarity Fund can only be paid after the completion of the procedures to mobilise the Fund and the respective approval by the Council and Parliament.
However, in the current situation, it is very difficult to ask people facing immense difficulties in resuming their normal way of life to wait.
Therefore, we ask for the greatest urgency and flexibility both in making funds available and taking exceptional measures to help Madeira.
<D>
(RO) Mr President, Romania is unfortunately facing a serious issue which endangers the safety and the health of European citizens: the use of non-sterile surgical thread imported from China in hospitals.
The Romanian Ministry of Health has known about this problem since August but, in spite of warnings that this might cause infections or even lead to the death of patients, it did not stop it in time.
The alarm was sounded after a patient died in hospital due to an infection and other patients are facing the same danger.
I believe that this is a warning signal not only for Romania but for all of Europe.
The fact that more and more products brought from China raise question marks and endanger the health and safety of European citizens is a very serious matter.
Not so long ago we had problems with sweets contaminated from powdered milk containing melanine, also imported from China.
We import products from China because they are cheaper, but I believe that Europe should put the health of its citizens first.
I am asking Commissioner Vassiliou to start an investigation in order to prevent any other incidents in the Member States.
We need urgent measures to inspect these products so as to stop imports to the internal market in due time.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, when the European Union is, at times, seen as over-keen on regulation and quite rightly criticised for this, this can be traced back, quite simply, to reports such as the one we are now discussing.
As much as I support realistic measures to combat any form of discrimination, I must also criticise the points being discussed here, because they are simply not justified and will not have the desired effect.
It is unacceptable that, as has already been mentioned, faith schools, for example, can be sued for rejecting teachers of a different faith, or no faith, or that insurance companies can be sued for undertaking a risk assessment if it results in a distinction on the basis of age or sex, or that there is a risk of absolutely all residential buildings having to be constructed to be barrier free.
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, that is the direction we are heading in; we will no longer actually be supporting disabled people, but making all housing unaffordable.
Housing that nobody can afford, instead of assistance for disabled people - surely that cannot be what we are aiming for here.
Then there is the criticism of the reversal of the burden of proof.
If I think that, as an MEP with 25 applicants for an assistant's position, I could have a case brought against me just for the appearance of discrimination or a feeling of discrimination, I will simply not be able to work any more, but spend all my time battling with the evidence I need to provide just because the feeling is there, even though I have not discriminated in any way.
On top of that, there is the vagueness of many of the terms.
Overall, this factsheet that has been published is a precursor to this directive, which starts to discuss whether we are still allowed to use 'Miss' and 'Mrs', or whether we need to get rid of all words ending in 'man', such as statesman or sportsman, because it could all be discriminatory.
Ladies and gentlemen, some of what is being called for here is quite simply nonsense, and I will therefore be voting against the report.
<D>
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FI) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Bali conference on climate was a success and we can be proud of the EU's role there.
Talks on the future of Kyoto were officially begun and all the essential issues are on the table.
Not one of them has been omitted.
The United States has thus not succeeded in limiting future negotiations, which are bound to be difficult, as people here have said.
The main message now, however, which Europe can send the world, is connected with our own climate policy.
The best way to speed up the difficult international process is for us to pass ambitious laws on emissions trading, renewable energy and energy efficiency.
I am glad that the Commission last week saw climate protection as a positive economic option - the new industrial revolution.
How we can remain at the forefront of the development in clean new energy technology is crucially important for our economic future.
We also have to understand that the real Gordian knot with regard to international negotiations on climate is fairness.
The planet cannot be rescued unless the big developing countries, like China and India, also limit their emissions.
For them to be able to accept this they have to feel that any negotiated solution is fair.
We must be prepared in one way or another to compensate developing countries for the fact that our emissions per head of population are many times greater than those in the developing countries.
<D>
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (EL) Mr President, Commissioner, let me first of all congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Sacconi, who has brought his experience on the issue of the environment and climate change to bear and produced a first-rate report.
Commissioner, as we engage in the real debate on climate change, the problems are all beginning to take shape, with great clarity and speed.
This is especially true of environmental, economic and energy problems, on which the development and growth of both the European and the international economy are modelled.
This development appears to have continued aimlessly, wasting natural and human resources, with the clear aim of accumulating capital.
However, the environment has reached a parlous state, as can be seen from natural disasters, and a credit crisis has been reached.
The energy products market is turbulent because there is no more equilibrium.
Spatial planning for energy sources and the food market are in turmoil because agriculture is being used to supply energy.
All this will prompt significant changes in the EU's production model.
However, other rival powers such as China and the United States will also take action, in a bid to redistribute productive capital and production factors.
We hope that the policy of adapting to climate change will prepare the EU's new European development model.
Perhaps this will protect the environment and employment and give new impetus to social policies, cross-border cooperation measures and taxation policy.
For this to happen, resources and the Community budget must be redistributed and bolstered since as far as we can judge, they are insufficient to cater for adaptation.
Commissioner, this is essential because tackling the problem of adaptation is politically costly; there must be no gap between the policies we announce and the budget we allocate.
If there is, we will not be trusted either by the citizens of today or by future generations.
Let me say that we fully support Mr Sacconi's report and make three fundamental requests.
Firstly, the policy of adaptation should be added to all Community policies.
Secondly, local, regional and central administrations should cooperate with each other; all policies, such as employment, cohesion and agricultural policy, should be coordinated; this is an important issue touched on by the rapporteur.
Thirdly, and most importantly, international agreements must be cooperated on.
We will have to bolster these policies as well as the fund, to which reference has been made.
Commissioner, we also await the results of the White Paper to which you have referred.
Bearing in mind your sensitivity to these issues and to interinstitutional cooperation between Parliament and the Commission, we believe that the European Parliament will play an important role in your endeavours.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, as a woman and also as a member of the Commission, first of all I would like to thank the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality for the defence of women in Europe, but also worldwide.
This report, presented today, is indeed to be seen within this context of a global fight against gender-related violence.
This is how we see it, and I thank the rapporteur very much, Mr Romeva i Rueda, for what he said.
Feminicide is a tragic issue which covers a much broader problem, that of violence against women, which we must fight at all levels: at local, but also at global levels.
And I would like to talk to you about what we as a Commission are doing to address the question of gender violence in general, again, and also in particular.
To promote it through our external relations policy in Mexico and in Central Asia.
Also, if you allow me, I would like to say a few words about my recent visit to the region, because I was there just last week (but not in Mexico).
I visited Panama, El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua.
I had already been in Mexico and I will go there most probably next year.
I can tell you that the Commission is on the frontline in the effort of preventing violence against women.
Let me remind you that, on 8 March 2006, the Commission issued what we called a 'road map for equality between men and women', outlining the eradication of all forms of gender-based violence as a priority objective.
In March of this year, we adopted a communication on gender equality in development cooperation, stating that gender-based violence in all its manifestations violates women's human rights and is indeed a serious obstacle to the achievement of equality, development and peace.
The Commission also supports projects on education and on awareness-raising interventions aimed at engaging all adolescents in programmes aiming at changing their behaviour in relation to violence against girls and women.
For instance, as I said, I was just in El Salvador, and I visited a programme that is called 'Pro Jóvenes', which is for girls and boys - but especially for girls - who have either already been in the so-called Maras, or who could enter into the Maras, in order to prevent them from doing so.
I was most impressed by this programme.
The New European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights also provides a wide scope for activities in the field of gender equality.
Concerning the situation in Mexico, I would like to point out that EU-Mexico relations are based on our 1997 global agreement, in which Article 1 identifies human rights as a fundamental element of EU-Mexican relations.
On that very basis, both parties have established what I think, in the mean time, is a fruitful cooperation in the fields of human rights and justice, a cooperation which is then carried out through our different Commission programmes implemented by the Mexican federal authorities, as well as through projects carried out also by non-state actors and by NGOs.
The Mexican authorities also keep us informed about gender-related violence in Mexico.
So we learned that a number of cases had been resolved and many others were under investigation.
My last personal conversation with the new Mexican Foreign Minister - who is, as you know, also a woman - was in Santo Domingo, where we mentioned this question of feminicide and where I got some relevant information about what the Mexican Government is doing.
They have also a special human rights adviser, another lady who is also working particularly on this issue.
In the case of Central America, as a region, the country where the issue is most critical is Guatemala.
Our approach has been to confront the issue, both in our dialogue with the authorities and through, again, a number of activities on the issue of violence against women.
This includes the mainstreaming on the gender dimension in all the cooperation programmes.
The Commission also organised, in March last year, an important communication campaign targeted at young people and decision-makers on how to stop violence against women.
In the same period we also welcomed the creation of a national commission on feminicide, composed of officials from the executive, the judiciary and also the congress, and a total of 18 state institutions.
Recently, we also noted the creation of an international commission against impunity in Guatemala, which we also strongly support.
As a part of this Commission programme supporting the judiciary, a specific component is dedicated to feminicide.
In particular to activities carried out by the so-called CEPROM.
This is the presidential office in charge, with whom we have a memorandum of understanding on cooperation.
Let me also mention our support for the preparatory work for the revision of the law against feminicide, now before Congress, with a view to the revision of the penal code.
Finally, let me say that I found a lot of goodwill and pro-European spirit in this trip to Central America on this issue.
I was really positively surprised by the interest in enhancing regional integration, and cooperative attitudes also towards the forthcoming negotiations of an association agreement.
I must say it was very important to see that even the interest in Panama was much higher than I expected.
I am looking forward to the possibility of everybody there being included.
The first message that I passed on there was the importance of achieving progress on the negotiations that will finally start at the San José Process in Costa Rica.
This is important because, naturally, it will be a political dialogue there; there will be a cooperation programme, and there will also be free trade negotiations.
But it will be a compact programme.
Social cohesion will be among the most important issues in the whole of Latin America, including Central America, and there this programme also has a very great importance.
Indeed, juvenile violence and violence against women are issues that we find have to be there because we have to all do everything in order to diminish violence in society.
<D>
(PL) Above all, I would like to congratulate Mr Coelho on two more successful reports.
Secondly, there can be no turning back from SIS II today.
If we want to think about a secure system, SIS II must be introduced, and this is why I think we need to continue these measures and support the Commission on this.
I will remind everyone that the new visa code stipulates that biometric data must be shown in the system.
SIS 1+ does not give this guarantee.
SIS II will enable rapid verification of data in future.
So in this area of security, we must not stop work on SIS II.
Of course, we might wish that this work could be more effective and more successful.
I will remind everyone that not so long ago, we also adopted measures which make it easy to travel throughout the Schengen Area with a long-term visa.
In relation to this, work on SIS II must be continued.
We want to support the Commission on this, in the hope that its work will proceed faster and be more effective, and we should wish the Commission success in this regard.
Thank you.
<D>
(SK) In the course of the last six years, the Slovak economy has been growing at an average rate of more than 6.5% per year.
Last year growth even exceeded 10%.
According to all the indicators, Slovakia meets the criteria with room to spare.
The Slovak authorities are aware of the situation with regard to the real and nominal convergence of the Slovak economy and its potential impact on future economic and inflationary development.
In their opinion, Slovakia's consolidation is in line with the Stability and Growth Pact.
In accordance with the approved three-year budget, the primary fiscal goal is to reach the deficit of 0.8% by 2010, so this means meeting the fiscal goal.
In accordance with the agreed data, the goal is to reach a balanced budget by 2011.
That means budget a surplus of 1.3% leaving aside the second pillar.
The Slovak Government has adopted measures to keep inflation under control.
In June it approved a modernisation programme, featuring structural reforms of the labour market, consolidation of public finances and support for education, science and research.
Let me emphasise that the representatives of the business community, entrepreneurs, employers, trade unions, pensioners, Slovak towns and villages, and banks all support the adoption of the euro in Slovakia.
The government's social partners signed a declaration in which they undertake to keep wage increases in line with productivity growth.
This will significantly contribute to the sustainability of inflation in Slovakia.
I would like to thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs for their correct approach, based on numbers, facts and analyses.
The Slovak officials and the Slovak people wish to contribute to the development of the European economy, and thus to the stability and reliability of the euro.
<D>
(EL) Mr President, whenever the strength of law yields to the law of the strong, the result is suffering.
It is only in Kosovo that we have seen things happening at lightning speed.
In 40 years in diplomacy, I have never seen such haste in the process not only of proclaiming independence but also of recognition by certain European states.
What they have recognised is not Kosovo, but a Pandora's Box.
I, for one, have never come across a situation so peculiar to itself.
Kosovo itself is not sui generis, but the establishment of a military base in Kosovo is.
In any case, I believe that we have deviated.
In this chamber, in front of MEPs who today represent the democratic governments of Europe, democratic parties and democratic sentiments, I have heard people say: 'You know, we have stepped in to solve the problem where Mr Ahtisaari failed.'
What are we?
Are we a body of appeal?
Is this Parliament a court of appeal?
Instead of worrying about what will happen in Kosovo tomorrow, it would be better, Mr President, for us to think about what will happen when the status of the UN is violated in this insulting, disdainful manner.
<D>
(ES) Mr President, Mrs Lynne, Commissioner, thank you very much for offering us this communication and this document, which are undoubtedly going to enable us to improve our knowledge of changes and trends, and the agenda that we need to have for the future.
We should not, however, make a mistake.
We have many documents, we have many analyses, we have many debates and we have many words, but here, as for diseases, we need not only a diagnosis but also treatment.
It is true, as you said, Commissioner, that we need European treatment, through the Union, its institutions and its mechanisms, in order to respond to the problems of today and tomorrow, taking into account that if we do not do it at Union level it will be impossible to do it solely at the level of the Member States.
Some Member States that are making fast progress, such as mine, are beginning to be threatened by policies that are seeking to slow down, or, in other Member States, to establish unfair competition with the supply and social change that is taking place in our countries.
Commissioner, please take account of the fact that the feeling is beginning to spread that European social policy, which in the 1960s and 1970s, as a Spanish trade unionist said to me in a letter today, was aimed at harmonising progress, and in the 1980s and 1990s limited itself to ensuring minimum requirements, is now beginning to slide towards a social policy in which there is competition between the Member States to achieve the lowest common denominator.
Commissioner, the risks that we face for the future include not only ageing and globalisation, but also the contagious lack of solidarity and aggressive, xenophobic and anti-European nationalism that is threatening both Europe's current social victories and its future ones.
<D>
Mr President, as an MEP elected in Latvia, I welcome the fact that the first example of a strategy for a macroregion concerns the Baltic Sea area.
Nevertheless, in my opinion, a number of Community objectives have been forgotten here - for instance, a high level of social protection.
Some of the region's Member States, including Latvia, have been severely hit by the economic crisis.
Our financial sector is interconnected with the Scandinavian one.
This means that our problems will create problems there, so this is not a national issue.
Recently, Latvia received medium-term financial assistance for balance of payments, provided for by the Commission.
Unfortunately, there are no social conditions for such assistance.
As a result, the government is reducing pensions and benefits, but the Commission tolerates this.
My second concern is about fundamental rights.
Mass statelessness and minority protection still constitute a topical issue in two of the region's Member States: Latvia and Estonia.
I think that the strategy must be more ambitious and seek to attain all the objectives of the European Union.
<D>
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the liberalisation of the market in visible vehicle spare parts is to be welcomed for three reasons.
The first is that consumers will benefit from more choice and competition.
The second is that we might perhaps see a fall in prices and that we can certainly expect pricing to become transparent, for design costs should be factored into the cost of new vehicles and not recouped through a downstream monopoly in the market for spare parts.
The third reason is that the job market in the European Union will benefit, as European parts manufacturers will also be able to produce spare parts for vehicles imported into the EU.
So far that has only been possible for manufacturers outside Europe.
During the 2004 election campaign I visited a parts factory near Gütersloh.
That company will be pleased with these new rules.
I also welcome the fact that important elements of the Commission's proposal, such as the repair clause, are contained in the draft adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs.
As shadow rapporteur for my Group on the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, I had advocated the retention of that clause.
I believe the draft brings us another step closer to a genuine single market.
There are two major defects, to which some of my fellow Members have already referred.
One of them is the fact that the former rapporteur delayed the report.
In so doing, Mr Radwan did not act as the representative of the European people but as the representative of the Bavarian Motor Works - BMW for short.
That was a rather unsavoury episode.
The second defect is that the grace period of five years creates rather a long delay.
Five years until liberalisation takes effect is a long time; it will delay competition and the beneficial effects of liberalisation.
I have heard that the German Government intends to keep stonewalling.
That is anti-competitive stupidity.
The sad thing is that it has become a trade mark of the German Government.
I hope they will desist from such action in the Council.
The bottom line is that we have a compromise with which we can live and which we ought to adopt.
I can only echo the words spoken by Mr Lehne, who I wish to thank at this point for all his work: we should bring this matter to a conclusion now and avoid any further delay at second reading.
<D>
(RO) Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to join my colleagues who welcomed the drawing up of this report and to emphasize its fundamental value for the future of Europe.
It is important that the Lisbon Treaty focuses on the role of citizens and the responsibility of institutions.
This is why I believe that, via this report, the European Parliament proves that it undertakes its new role in the functioning of the European Union.
In this regard, I reiterate the support for all the treaty provisions that stipulate a consolidated role of the parliaments, both at national and European level.
Secondly, I would like to mention the changes that the Lisbon Treaty proposes in the field of the European Union's foreign policy.
Their transposition into facts is crucial for consolidating the European action in this direction.
Consequently, the essential element of the report is the call for ratification by all the 27 Member States.
I express my satisfaction that Romania ratified the Treaty in February 2008, thus becoming the fourth country that has proved its European vocation and firm wish to contribute to the ever more prosperous future of the European Union.
<D>
Mr President, after 15 years this will be my last speech in the European Parliament and I think there are few more important issues than the whole question of asylum and how European countries face this challenge.
There is no easy response to this issue either.
If there was, some country would have found it by now.
In reality, I would suggest that the only way to reduce the number of desperate people who seek refuge or asylum in a country other than their own is to address the root causes that force them to leave their homes and countries of origin.
That is why it is so important that we in the EU, and in all developed democratic countries, offer advice, help and support - including financial support - to those countries that are affected by war, internal violence, lack of human rights or discrimination.
Equally, we have to address the poverty around the world which contributes to migratory pressures.
We should never condemn people who are forced to seek asylum or refugee status.
Instead, we should offer sympathy and offer our support.
That is our challenge today.
<D>
in writing. - (DE) Mr President, President Maystadt, Mr Audy, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank the rapporteur most warmly and congratulate him on the good, balanced work he has carried out.
I congratulate the EIB on its successful activities and ambitious business plan.
When it comes to energy and innovation, the EIB is helping the EU to implement its policy.
Without the EIB we would not have got the CIP off to such a good start.
The EIB's strategy for 2007-2009 provides for reinforcement of the value added, the gradual increase in risk taking, the use of new financial instruments and the stepping-up of cooperation with the Commission.
I heartily endorse this strategy.
The evaluation of the activity by the EIB rapporteur and the suggested next steps are correct.
However, we must not forget that the role of Parliament is limited.
Although the EIB is one of the Community's institutions, its power is exercised internally according to intergovernmental rules, which means that the Member States are the most influential shareholders.
The European Parliament has been commenting on the EIB's activity reports regularly since 1999 and this has developed into a close, trusting, successful relationship of cooperation.
I would particularly like to praise the cooperation with President Maystadt, which is exemplary for relationships with other institutions.
<D>
Madam President, I have been following the case of Tibet for years.
I have visited the region and have spoken to many people inside and outside the country.
I consider the Tibetan people's claims to be legitimate and to a certain extent logical.
I especially find their current fears more than justified in view of the Chinese Government's policy of severe repression towards them, which has now lasted more than 50 years, apart from a brief and, I would say, false truce during the Olympic Games.
I have known few people more clearly willing to talk and reach an agreement than the Tibetan people.
That is why I fail to understand this obsession by the Chinese Government both to twist reality and to insist on blocking the round of talks again and again.
A country is not made great by its military strength or its size or its economic wealth.
What makes it great is the magnanimity of its acts and its generosity.
The European Union can and must help to resolve this situation, while of course respecting the sovereignties involved, but it must do so firmly.
The way to do this is to support the Tibetan request to restart the Chinese-Tibetan talks and to recognise that, if anyone has spent years giving way to and being pressurised by the Chinese authorities, then in this case it is the Tibetan people.
This is not a conflict between equals in terms of either capacity or motives.
The European Union must be respectful towards both parties, but it cannot remain neutral towards the oppression, indiscriminate detentions, torture, murders or the religious, linguistic and cultural genocide.
The memorandum for genuine autonomy for the Tibetan people, now rejected by China as a working document, shows that the Tibetan people have already made a genuine effort and given up an enormous amount of what, I emphasise, are their legitimate aspirations.
China now has the opportunity to show the world its generosity and its desire for peace and harmony and, above all, the European Union has the opportunity to help it act in accordance with its greatness.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, because of globalisation our living and working conditions are changing so rapidly that many citizens are losing track of things.
They feel swamped and insecure.
The guidelines of the Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs need to be clearly visible to them: competitive jobs, equal opportunities and social cohesion.
The flexicurity concept is still not sufficiently understood.
Not only do employees have to become more flexible in their own interests in order to improve their employability, but enterprises also have to become more flexible by developing new marketing strategies and innovative products and capturing market niches, among other things.
At the same time, employees need efficient social security systems to ensure that they are integrated rather than excluded.
Their work should be rewarded appropriately according to the sector and region by agreements between the social partners, not by government intervention.
The aim of European employment policy is both to provide more people with jobs and to create higher quality jobs.
At the same time there has to be investment in education and training in order to ensure that the concept of lifelong learning is genuinely sustained and includes underperformers.
It must be made clear that both the ESF as well as the European Regional Development Fund and the new Globalisation adjustment Fund must directly benefit those threatened or affected by unemployment.
They should be better prepared for change and be able to enter new spheres of work.
We shall also be measured by whether we have managed to keep older employees in work processes for longer, instead of shunting them into early retirement.
They are highly motivated, able to work under pressure and have know-how aplenty.
Best practices should demonstrate how young and old cooperate through teamwork and how both sides benefit.
The guidelines for employment policy in this very good report will be accepted above all if the subsidiarity principle is consistently maintained.
Mrs Van Lancker is right: the Member States have to prove that they are taking part in this, and then confidence in our social market model will increase.
<D>
(LT) Mr President, since the beginning of the term of office, I have been analysing the results of the work of the EU agencies on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe.
I would like to point out that the number of agencies has nearly doubled in the current year.
Despite some critical remarks in the speech of the rapporteur regarding the work of these agencies, I find it necessary to mention certain positive changes compared with last year.
There is an increase in transparency and democratic responsibility as a result of the implementation of Parliament's suggestion to have the agencies' work assessed by the relevant committees.
Nevertheless, some problems still remain.
In this regard we should determine the position of the agencies' activities within the EU management system.
As I have already mentioned, the number of agencies has grown considerably and we get the blame for that; and even Parliament sometimes shares the opinion that it is an indirect way of increasing bureaucracy.
Perhaps, however, it highlights the need to review the EU management system along with that of the European Commission, especially the system of management and administration.
A series of projects are currently being implemented with the aim of improving the system.
It seems that we should consider a more radical reform, which would yield positive results and contribute to achieving more transparency in the work of both the agencies and the Commission.
<D>
(SV) Like many countries, Sweden, where I come from, is heavily dependent on the car industry.
Volvo and Saab are well-known makes.
The Swedish car industry has, like the rest of the car industry, been severely affected by the crisis.
Several factors have contributed to this crisis, but one factor in particular is the failure to make the necessary switch in production at an early enough stage.
The switch to the production of smaller, lower-energy and more environmentally-sound vehicles is necessary.
The EU has for a long time required a one-sided flexibility from workers.
I and the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left demand that we also impose the requirement for flexibility on the part of the management of the large undertakings.
The lack of flexibility and new thinking has, after all, contributed to the crisis we are seeing in the car industry and in other industries.
Finally, I would like to say that the car industry is an important workplace, an often predominantly male workplace, and it has our full support.
I trust that the EU will show the same level of commitment when we have a crisis and downturn in what can be considered to be female workplaces.
<D>
Madam President, at next week's European Council summit, nothing new will come from An Taoiseach Brian Cowan in relation to the current Lisbon Treaty impasse in Ireland.
Instead he will make an intervention similar to that of his colleague, Minister Micheál Martin, where only an analysis of the results was communicated on Monday to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs of the European Parliament.
Nothing concrete will be proposed until the December Council summit, where a clear road map ahead is expected to be outlined.
In order to expedite moves towards this road map, I would like to expound my idea on how to now move forward.
First, in my view, there cannot be a second referendum for at least 12 months, in order to allow adequate consultation with the Irish electorate.
A second referendum should be called during the autumn of next year, possibly in October.
This means that Parliament elections will have to take place under the Nice Treaty, but this is the lesser of two evils in my opinion.
As to the nature of the second referendum, I would propose an extended plebiscite on the Lisbon Treaty in Ireland, where we would have a constitutional referendum on yes or no to the Lisbon Treaty while, on the same day, polling consultative referenda on key opt-in, opt-out issues such as the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and European security and defence policy.
If in the extended referendum Irish voters were to opt out of either of these two areas, the Irish Government could then seek a separate agreement at the European Council to be signed by all 27 Member States.
This move would be similar to the precedent of the Edinburgh Agreement sought by the Danes at the Council meeting in December 1992, which granted Denmark four exemptions to the Maastricht Treaty.
This allowed them to ratify the Treaty overall.
With this plan, Member States who have already ratified the Lisbon Treaty would not have to do so again.
This extended plebiscite would offer the Irish electorate a choice as to the extent of the role that they want to play within the European Union.
<D>
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) On behalf of my Group may I echo and endorse what the Council President and the Commissioner have just said about events in Turkey.
Secondly, I would like to thank the rapporteur for the way he has worked with us in preparing this debate and, thirdly, I would repeat on behalf of my Group that in our view - and the Council President said the same - enlargement has so far proved a success and is making a significant contribution to the development of a wider European Union.
We need to stress that fact right at the beginning of my speech, and Mr Brok's report makes the point too: we stand - as the Commissioner has said - by the promises made to Turkey and the countries of the Western Balkans in our discussion of enlargement strategy.
So there is no change in strategy vis à vis those countries, but greater attention will be paid to the way in which the accession criteria are applied and managed during the negotiation process.
Secondly, we agree with the rapporteur that more attention needs to be paid to the Union's own capacity to absorb new members.
On the one hand we are asking more of applicant countries during the preparation phase, but on the other hand the European Union clearly has to do rather more to manage the arrival of new members appropriately.
And we think this means completing the necessary institutional reforms.
The Treaty of Nice is not an adequate basis for successful further enlargement.
Thirdly, and to my mind most importantly: this report also looks beyond the current enlargement agenda to countries that are not on the list of potential applicants.
Our existing European Neighbourhood Policy is not enough.
That is true of our neighbours to the south, and the EU has put forward a proposal for a Mediterranean Union, but it is truer still of our neighbours to the east.
We have reached the clear conclusion that the European Union must offer more, more than the Neighbourhood Policy.
We think it has to encompass both relations between those countries and the Union and bilateral relations between the countries.
The Black Sea would be a good geographic framework here, with a role for both Russia and Turkey.
Without these two countries the main challenges and problems in that region will not be resolved.
Turkey would have a pivotal role between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean and this would give it the chance to show just how important Turkey is in Europe and how valuable it is to the European Union.
<D>
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (NL) Mr President, following the rejoicing over the unanimous support for these three reports by the Committee on Transport and Tourism, I would like to wind up the discussion with two critical observations: the European Railway Agency can fulfil the useful task of further developing and applying the new European Rail Traffic Management System and reducing its dependence on manufacturers.
But the Agency is especially needed in other areas due to the increasingly large scale of operations, liberalisation and competition on the tracks.
These developments necessitate more and more bureaucracy to make it possible to coordinate everything properly.
Long before the creation of the European Union, that coordination happened differently.
There were good agreements between national railway companies, which organised train connections together over long distances, together with the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons Lits.
I doubt whether the new model is an improvement.
From now on, any railway vehicle which is approved in principle in one Member State will automatically be accepted in other Member States.
Such a situation does not even exist yet on a small scale between town tram companies; this is because the sharpness of the bends, the location of stops and sometimes the distance between two tracks mean that some trams cannot travel every route.
I expect too that the railway companies will frequently appeal for possible exceptions on the basis of security.
In practice, therefore, very little will change.
<D>
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, natural disasters sadden us all the more because they create so many victims, as recently in China or Burma.
They remind us of the value of any human life, and also the fact that we cannot control nature.
We wish to send a message of compassion to those suffering natural and political disasters.
One of the aims of politicians is to prevent public misfortune from befalling their people.
Thus, if they cannot prevent natural disasters, they can attempt to anticipate them and alert the people, and above all they must minimise risk through responsible prevention policies.
By way of example, China's Promethean infrastructure, such as its huge power dams and nuclear power plants, has held out.
Yet how long can it hold out?
Is it not better to use a larger number of smaller structures to spread the risk, and increase public information on the risks involved?
The most tragic situation for the Chinese people, however, is in relation to political disasters.
Although we acknowledge the admirable character of this hard-working skilful people and its sensitive culture, we can judge political acts without delving too far into domestic policies.
Its calamitous single-child policy is a major disaster.
It affects children, the large numbers of peasant families obliged to dispose of daughters, a poor source of revenue that does nothing to ensure the continuity of farms and retirement, or the second child who has no right to exist on the orders of Creon.
Such is the disdain for human rights when a political order does not allow parents to have as many children as they want.
Here again, life is not considered at its true value, but as a mere utilitarian function.
Natural disaster and political disaster merge, however, when a school's roof falls in, crushing the only child and leaving the parents distraught.
When the 30 000 journalists expected in Beijing for the Olympic Games arrive there, they should take time out to investigate, beyond mere appearances, the reality of this country which, through overriding power and efficiency, risks losing all respect for human beings, the real basis of the political order.
<D>
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FI) Mr President, first I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Mavrommatis, for his excellent work and commitment to this report.
To begin with, I want to say that I think it is very important that during the implementation phase of the White Paper the policies on sport as a general-interest, non-profit, voluntary activity should remain priorities in Europe.
It is also vital that through this document we are able to say we have respect for the specificity of sport, self-regulation and structured dialogue, and we therefore want to lay down guidelines for the application of European Union law in sport.
Furthermore, there is a crucial link between sport, exercise and public health.
Current problems we have in Europe that we are trying to control are metabolic syndrome, type II diabetes and obesity.
Healthy exercise enables us to prevent these problems in the best possible way.
Secondly, we need to realise that it is important for the European Sport for All policy to retain national gambling systems.
They need to be preserved because they have created a unique opportunity to finance amateur sport, as well as culture, science and research.
Other social sectors have thus benefitted from sport.
This needs to be taken into consideration in the future.
Thirdly, I want to mention that sport will acquire a firmer legal basis under the Lisbon Treaty.
We also have to prepare for this new situation, with a pilot programme and budget headings for 2009 being planned now.
We have to move on from words to deeds, and that also holds true for sport.
We can achieve much overall with the document being discussed.
I would once again like to thank Commissioner Figel, and, in particular, that great man of sport, Mr Mavrommatis, who has done pioneering work to promote sport's new march forward in the context of European culture and society.
<D>
in writing. - (CS) I too am disturbed by the worries of the tens of thousands of citizens who in their petition highlight the risks accompanying the construction of the biggest gas pipeline at the bottom of the shallow Baltic Sea.
Their petition resulted in a public hearing and in a European Parliament report, which highlighted the need to include other countries, and the EU in particular, in the decision-making process.
The problems are due to the ecological risks that exist as a result of vast graveyards of warships and munitions at the bottom of the sea, and a risky chemical method needed to clean the pipeline before it enters into service.
I shall not express an opinion on the land-based alternative route but I firmly believe that the European Commission and the Council must take up their role as coordinators duties and consistently demand - in the interest of the Baltic and other countries - that the investors assume full responsibility for potential ecological damage.
The Commission and the Council must also request an independent impact assessment and an assessment of the alternative land-based route.
The northern gas supply route from Russia is important.
Therefore, it is imperative that the EU signs an agreement with Russia regarding the conditions for monitoring the construction of the gas pipeline and for its safe operation.
After all, Russia has not yet ratified the Espoo Convention.
Unfortunately, we do not yet have a common EU energy policy or standards.
We can clearly see that instead of a bilateral agreement between Germany and Russia, Europeans need an EU agreement and the consent of the Baltic countries to the construction.
Parliament is now sending a clear political signal in this regard.
<D>
in writing. - I welcome the proposals made by the Commission.
I can give an assurance that we, in the EPP and EP, are ready to work with you and the Council on this.
Europe is about mutual and close interdependency.
The current crisis demonstrates how important it is to know more about the challenges and worries the other members experience and to be prepared for common actions.
The proposed coordination and control mechanisms are needed, taking into account both the European dimension and specific realities of each Member State.
However, control mechanisms are not a solution but just a means.
They should not be overestimated.
The solution is in more efficient work, entrepreneurship and innovation.
The key to the solution is prevention.
Special attention should be paid to budgetary frameworks and the state debts.
Instead of breaking financial control into smaller clusters, monitoring of the macro-economic situation as a whole is needed.
The new dual system of incentives and sanctions deserves support.
I also encourage making better use of Eurostat.
Reliable and timely data is a crucial component to making the right decisions.
I encourage the Council to show political will on the measures proposed, so that we can proceed to the practical implementation phase.
<D>
- I would like to thank the President-in-Office.
I do not mean to make him paranoid with my question.
It was tabled, after all, last December.
I am anti-smoking, not anti-smokers.
We all agree they need all the help they can get: nicotine replacement therapies etc.
But we must recognise the damage that passive smoking does to those who do not enjoy smoking, so please do not feel personally under the spotlight here.
Could you guarantee me then that, before the end of the Czech Presidency, you will have ratified the framework convention - yes or no?
It would be extremely important if you could give me guarantees on that.
After all, cigarettes are the only legal product on our shop shelves that, if used by consumers according to instructions, kills one in two of the consumers.
They are amazing really.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I welcome Mr Wijkman's report and thank him for his continuing support for the Global Climate Change Alliance.
Overall we believe that the report highlights the right issues and identifies the key challenges the international community currently faces in providing support to climate change mitigation and adaptation in developing countries.
We appreciate, in particular, the report's proposals, firstly to develop the Global Climate Change Alliance into a clearing house for Member State initiatives.
We agree that current efforts to assist developing countries in this important area are fragmented and not well coordinated, and do not correspond to the Paris principles on aid effectiveness, to which all EU Member States have signed up.
Secondly, the proposal to set a long-term financing goal for the GCCA.
It is pivotal, however, that EU Member States fully align themselves to this initiative and make increased ODA commitments and innovative sources of financing available for the GCCA.
The financing goal set by the European Commission alone would be meaningless.
Finally, the proposal to spend part of the expected revenues from auctioning emission rights within the EU emissions trading scheme on funding for the GCCA and other climate change measures in developing countries.
We need - particularly in the current context - continued European Parliament support in the realisation of these proposals, in particular through engagement with decision-makers at Member State level.
The report highlights a number of points for further clarification by the Commission, who would respond, in particular, on the distinct added value of the GCCA.
Overall the GCCA is intended as a key component of the European Union's climate change policy.
Traditionally, this policy has been focused on mitigation inside and outside the Union.
The Green Paper/White Paper process now deals primarily with adaptation inside the Union.
The GCCA represents the external dimension of our adaptation efforts.
Besides, it is important to underline the fact that the international community needs to arrive at the conclusion of a global climate change agreement at Copenhagen in December 2009, so as to avoid a gap between the Kyoto Protocol and the follow-up agreement.
Developing countries will only enter such an agreement if adaptation is specifically considered.
The European Union must also assume its leadership role in this context, and the GCCA is a vehicle to demonstrate our commitment.
Mr Wijkman's report could have made stronger reference to this political imperative.
Furthermore, the European Union is the largest provider of development assistance.
Climate change, clearly, is a threat to development.
The GCCA aims at placing climate change adaptation firmly within EU development policy.
Finally, the GCCA would like to employ different means in developing climate-related assistance, away from project funding and towards programme-based approaches.
We believe that resilience to climate change can only be built effectively in this way.
The Commission has already entered into the initial implementation stage of the Global Climate Change Alliance.
In doing so, it is paying due attention to the report's proposals, in particular as regards close involvement of partner country representatives and close coordination with other, related bi- and multiannual, multilateral initiatives.
Finally, the Commission recognises the need for better mainstreaming of climate change into its own aid programmes, in close coordination with the partner countries and development partners at country level.
Ongoing work at the OECD on the development of guidelines for mainstreaming adaptation into development cooperation will assist us in these efforts.
<D>
(SV) Mr President, the food crisis we are now facing risks setting mankind back a decade when it comes to poverty, and risks creating instability and human misery in a large part of the world.
I believe that it is important to emphasise this, and also to state that we in the agriculture sector have not seen the same rapid development as experienced in the parts of the world's economy which have been globalised.
What we see is the failure of regulated agricultural markets, a lack of open trade, and regulation which prevents farmers from using their land.
It is clear that, if we wish to, we can also decide to tackle many of the difficult problems we are currently struggling with.
Greater use of the available areas of the earth's surface is a good thing in the battle for a better climate.
Having more cultivated products contributes towards biofuels as well as food.
However, at the same time there is also an opportunity to open the doors to economic development in the developing world.
At the same time this gives us in Europe the opportunity to pave the way for a more dynamic and open agricultural sector.
However, the answer to these problems does not lie in more regulation and more subsidies.
Instead it lies in greater openness for Europe's farmers and farmers the world over to produce the food and the biofuels which the world needs.
This is freer agriculture, freer farmers and free trade.
If we manage to achieve this, we will also be able to make more progress in the international Doha negotiations, the free trade negotiations, while simultaneously doing something towards a better climate and a better world.
<D>
- (PL) Madam President, pesticides are harmful to the environment and to animals.
I should like to point out that the conditions in which old pesticides are stored in many countries are such that the products represent a danger to the environment and to human beings.
It will be impossible for poor countries to deal with this matter without Union aid.
Sustainable use of pesticides is an important issue.
The provision of information and training for users is crucial, as is support for the latter by the agro-technical services.
Some experts believe that the quantities of pesticides used are many times greater than is actually needed.
This is commonest where small users are concerned, as these people lack the necessary agro-technical knowledge on many subjects.
Other important issues are placing the pesticides on the market, scientific research in this area and all types of action to reduce the impact of pesticides on health and the environment whilst still proving effective.
I should like to thank Mrs Klass and Mrs Breyer very much for the reports they have prepared.
I should also like to point out that these directives make a great deal of sense, provided that they are effectively implemented and become part of agricultural practice.
The Union for Europe of the Nations Group supports the directive.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Let me start with the second question and say that we cannot call it a food crisis if we find a defective commodity in the market.
It could be a food crisis if we allow this commodity to circulate freely within the European Union.
Then we could have a crisis, because we could endanger the health of our citizens.
But with the system that we have in force and which we apply very carefully and meticulously, we try to avoid these crises.
We have managed on numerous (and also on recent) occasions to avoid food crises.
Regarding the controls on products and foodstuffs produced outside the European Union, I have to say that we demand from our trading partners that they apply exactly the same controls as we apply to their internally produced foodstuffs.
That is why, for example, I mentioned Malaysia, where we sent our FVO and they found that the system was not really working properly, and we banned the importation of fish from Malaysia.
The same was done in the case of beef from Brazil and, on many other occasions, from Bangladesh.
So we demand from our partners that, if they want to export to the European Union, they abide by the hygiene rules that we apply within the Union.
<D>
- (SL) I note with regret that none of the former Communist countries has yet fully investigated and recognised the crimes of Communism in the period following the Second World War.
Because these regimes were in power for decades after the war, they managed to destroy most of the evidence.
This is why the criminals, or the perpetrators, have not even been named, let alone convicted.
History was written by the victors.
The European Union must call upon all of the countries which were previously ruled by Communist regimes to enable their historians to carry out research and include the whole truth about the post-war era in school textbooks.
They should also write about the culpability of the Western allied forces which returned or extradited exiles into the hands of the Communists.
The European Union should also call upon all of the Member States to consider renaming those streets and squares which are named after controversial heroes, such as Tito in Yugoslavia, who were accountable for many post-war killings, by virtue of their roles at the time.
<D>
Madam President, I echo the thanks of others to the rapporteur for her work on bringing this initiative forward to Parliament.
I said last night in one of the debates that we are in a week when there is a lot of soul-searching in the European Union about what the idea of Europe is for, and how we can re-engage with our citizens and really show the people of Europe that we are doing a worthwhile job and protecting them, their families and their interests.
I think this is another example, where we are looking at safety measures and at using the most modern technology to help them when they come into difficulties; we are trying to argue that cars should be better equipped.
Of course, this has a Europe-wide dimension, because cars are made in nearly every European country (far fewer are made, I have to say, in the United Kingdom than they were before).
People drive cars that are French, Italian or German, that are made in Spain or Britain and assembled elsewhere and, of course, we must have transnational legislation to support the highest possible standards.
If this means, through this initiative, that we can save lives through getting medical aid around and we can help people who might not otherwise have done to survive when they have an accident, then this is something that the British citizen and the citizens of the other European countries and Ireland should be able to gauge into.
We may look at this initiative and think this is very much futuristic and not going to happen for while.
But it was not such a long time ago - I am thinking of 30 years ago when I got my first car, and I look around the room and perhaps Members here may have got their first car longer ago than that - that cars did not automatically have radios in them.
Now, I do not know whether it is possible to buy a car without a radio, CD player or those sorts of things.
Now cars, as the previous speaker said, are made to go faster and faster and are more sophisticated than ever: satellite navigation systems, e-systems, as we are talking about here, will be in cars very shortly and they will probably be standard in 20 years' time.
This is something we should welcome, and we should spread the news.
Therefore, I congratulate all involved.
<D>
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, as already stated, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has unanimously rejected the Commission's proposal to increase the quotas for the coming milk year by 2%.
This would amount to 2.8 million tonnes.
We consider this proposal to be too rigid, too inflexible, and it is the wrong signal in the current situation, particularly for the markets.
Based on the rulings of 2003, there will be a 0.5% increase in quotas for 11 Member States anyway on 1 April this year - the equivalent of 700 000 tonnes more milk in the European Union.
The intensive debates with my colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture have shown that there will be no panacea, nor any comfortable way to conduct further debates.
There are widely differing opinions and all positions, from the general and fundamental rejection of any increase in quotas up to and including a 5% increase, were represented.
We nevertheless managed to find a compromise that took account of the positions of all the groups, and this was unanimously accepted with no dissenting votes or abstentions.
My heartfelt thanks go to all my fellow Members for their constructive cooperation.
The agreed compromise has two focal points.
Commissioner, you have said as much.
I have a different opinion on this.
Firstly, the establishment of a European balancing mechanism, by which under- or over-shooting of the existing national quotas can be compensated at EU level.
This would not be very bureaucratic and would result in producers who exceed their quotas being penalised only after balancing.
Secondly, as from 1 April, the Member States can decide to raise national quotas voluntarily for the 2008/2009 quota year.
We want flexibility, not rigidity!
This compromise means that the quotas that already exist will be used more efficiently.
For Member States with greater potential, there is also the opportunity to use this European quota framework along the lines of a common European internal market system.
Commissioner, you always stress that the existing milk quota will expire in this system in 2015.
A linear increase in quotas alone will not, however, create the soft landing you promise.
Just think back, if you will, to the old milk lakes!
The Committee on Agriculture has therefore unequivocally been arguing, as it has done already in the mini milk package, in favour of setting up a milk fund in order to achieve savings in costs resulting from the reforms explicitly for the milk sector.
In our view such forward-looking promotion and preservation of the entire sector can be made possible only in this way.
In particular this instrument should be used for dairy farmers in disadvantaged areas and in areas completely given over to grazing land and pasture.
I would therefore ask you, Commissioner, to include this request by the European Parliament in tangible terms in your legislative health check proposal.
In our view the application of Article 69 is insufficient because it is not clearly defined in terms of practical measures, particularly for the sector already mentioned.
It is also pure cynicism when a high-ranking Commission official announces to a gathering of farmers that they should not be complaining about producer prices already effectively falling again, since they had already been making do with 27 cents per litre of milk.
This is contempt for the legitimate interests of an entire profession, which I, as a Member of a Parliament, having taken up the cause of democracy at the highest level, do not accept!
<D>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am answering some Members who are not present, but I would like to clarify something: the report mentions minority rights and religious freedom.
It does not mention respect for human rights in the EU simply because that does not come the remit of this report.
However, I believe that we have actually covered this in some ways, because we have not simply listed our criticisms of everyone, we have talked about us, about how we use - for better or for worse - the instruments available, and respect for EU law.
When we say that human rights clauses are not applied properly, we are talking about ourselves!
Therefore, I do not think that the report can be criticised in this way.
I think Mr Lenarčič spoke at length about the instruments that should be used.
The advice I would like to give, which is contained in the report, is to talk more about assessing results than about the individual instruments obtained.
Mr Agnoletto criticised us for not saying enough about the collective dimension of human rights.
In actual fact, I believe that fundamental human rights are based first and foremost on individual rights.
Today, even with genocide, the most collective and terrible of crimes, individuals can refer cases to the International Criminal Court and thus protect their individual rights.
The right to democracy is now a fundamental human right, and this is an important instrument to be used.
Mainstreaming should, I believe, focus more on respect for human rights in terms of immigration and drug prevention policies.
I would like to finish by answering Mr Howitt.
The report does not claim that non-violence is the only means of promoting human rights, but that it is the most appropriate means.
It argues for non-violence not only as the absence of violence, as pacifism, but as an active campaign of disobedience and sabotage of authoritarian regimes and dictatorships.
In this sense, we propose that the EU should promote the technologies and techniques of non-violence in human rights and democracy promotion.
I hope that this paragraph will be saved in tomorrow's vote.
<D>
(FR) Madam President, our rapporteurs are not to blame, but I do believe that the Commission's proposals have come rather late in the day and are no match for what has taken place.
To prevent any further crisis, we obviously need to be much more ambitious and more pro-active.
We have to be more ambitious and more pro-active in the area of regulation, firstly.
We have to harmonise our legislation, and the most powerful signal would undoubtedly be to provide ourselves with a European regulator.
That is ultimately the way to make a statement.
In terms of rating agencies, we need to create European agencies whose independence is guaranteed and to put a stop to this scandalous business of seeing agencies rate businesses that pay them.
Regarding hedge funds, we need to regulate them and to devise a form of taxation that penalises all short-term financial transactions.
Lastly, as regards tax havens, some very simple measures must be taken.
We have to ban any banks that perform transactions with tax havens or that refuse to cooperate from operating in Europe.
That is all for now.
However, I do believe that we need to go further, and I should like here to suggest two courses of action.
The first is that we must, in my view, give thought to enlarging the euro zone and to integrating new members.
This political gesture would probably be as powerful as the reunification of Germany was in its day, and it would show the solidarity that exists within Europe and would increase the influence of our Union.
Finally, the second is that we must progress towards economic, budgetary and monetary integration, and towards tax harmonisation, which is the only way to combat fiscal dumping in Europe.
All of this is necessary, but what our fellow citizens expect most of all - and I hope that the Commission is listening - is for us to take action in response to the crisis.
Our fellow citizens are still waiting for a true European recovery plan and, for example, a substantial loan.
They are still waiting for Europe to offer proper support to our SMEs, to genuinely plan investments for the future and, above all, to support all those in Europe who are affected by the crisis.
I am thinking of the unemployed, of those working part time, and of the households that are experiencing huge difficulties at the moment.
This, in my view, is where the urgency lies and this is what Europe's leaders will be judged on in the future.
<D>
The agreement expressed by the European Council on 15 and 16 October is a start, but it is not enough.
We need to rebalance European Monetary Union, in conjunction with development and social policies.
We need a single Community policy and new institutional and economic governance to restore the basic balance of the economy in the eurozone.
The creation of a joint European fund basically needs to be re-examined as the consequence of direct measures taken to deal with the credit crunch and it needs to be made clear that taxpayers cannot be burdened in the long term.
The philosophy of allowing the credit crunch to regulate itself applied so far at national level harbours dangers of the nationalization of economic and social policies and the emergence of a multiple-track European economy.
This splintering of the institutional profile of the EU should be avoided.
Europe has a unique and historic opportunity and it must put forward its new economic and social development model, as it had started to do through policies on climate change, energy security, social stability and a sustainable economy.
When the economic crisis has run its course, it should find the EU much stronger at political and institutional level, more social and leading the way on policy on climate change.
<D>
The rapporteur defines the concept of 'precarious work' as forms of employment with a low level of job security, low pay, a lack of social protection and employment-related benefits, a lack of protection from discrimination, limited prospects for advancement on the labour market or collective representation, or a working environment that fails to meet minimum safety and health standards.
The financial and economic crisis has made precarious work an even more visible and urgent problem.
Companies have made decisive cuts to temporary jobs and there is a fear that the jobs which have been lost will not be replaced.
Unfortunately, the situation has had the biggest impact on women, and the problem is most visible in the services industry (hotels, catering, education, health, social work) and agriculture.
Women employed in these sectors are not employed on a full-time basis, which means that their salaries and pensions are lower, they receive lower levels of social support and lack career advancement opportunities.
The latest research indicates that it is more difficult for women to find a job than for men.
Furthermore, there is still a huge gender pay gap (the gap stands around 18%, with women earning a fifth less per hour than men).
In view of the abovementioned problems, I voted in favour of the report, which proposes a solution to this difficult situation with regard to employment policy.
<D>
We have spent around EUR 90 million on the EU campaign to promote a healthy diet for European school children.
The aim is to encourage children to eat healthily by offering them free fruit.
So we are spending millions on drumming it into the heads of children that they should eat apples and other fruit.
Then we plan to introduce a food labelling system in which foods with a low sugar, fat and salt content would have a green traffic light on the label and those with a high content a red traffic light.
All of a sudden, those apples which we have supplied at a cost of millions of euros would have a red label because of their sugar content and would therefore be seen as being unhealthy.
The kids would probably not find anything very complimentary to say about the EU if this were the case.
Even those people who do not think about what they eat have finally got the message that consuming excessive amounts of convenience foods, biscuits, sweets and alcohol is unhealthy.
For all the people who want to take their health into consideration when buying food, or who are forced to do so because of an illness, a complete list of ingredients is much more important.
This will make it easier for diabetics, for example, to calculate the number of bread units, instead of having to guess how much insulin to inject.
For the 10% or so of consumers who apparently read the nutrition labelling, the calorific value and calorie content are the ideal solution.
In contrast, a confusing colour-coded system does not really serve a useful purpose.
<D>
I fear the provisions put forward by the Commission - especially those concerning the ending of Objective 2 and abandonment of the regional aspect of cohesion policy in favour of a sectoral approach - may mean a return to the concept of a two-speed Europe and an increase in the distance, in terms of economy and civilisation, between the old and the new Europe.
Such a model would be a departure from integration of the entire 27 and from the idea of solidarity enshrined in Article 3 of the Treaty of Lisbon.
That idea, surely, lies at the root of the entire cohesion policy, which is intended to bring about equalisation of opportunities and elimination of differences between regions.
The proposal of the Commission concerning increasing the emphasis on research and the development of new technologies should be praised.
This is the route which Europe needs.
In choosing this, we must not, however, forget those regions and countries where bringing the standard of living up to the EU average is a fundamental matter.
Please remember that between the richest and poorest areas of the EU there is a greater than 11 times difference in wealth.
Eliminating these differences must continue to be the main principle of EU cohesion policy.
A new version of the document is currently being written.
I hope that in the new version, the Commission will take account of the words which were said during today's debate, and of what is being said in various parts of the European Union and at various levels: local governments, governments, associations and non-governmental organisations.
Good regional policy can be achieved only with close cooperation from the regions.
(The sitting was suspended at 11.05 and resumed at 11.30)
<D>
, in writing. - There are many reasons to mark the 40th anniversary of the Customs Union.
The far-reaching abolishment of customs among the Member States of the European Union is without a doubt one of the most important achievements of the Union.
It has been of great benefit to both businesses and European consumers.
A lot of responsibility is placed in the hands of the customs control officials on the external borders of the Union.
Counterfeit products, illegal trade in drugs and other harmful substances and smuggling of endangered species or products are challenges met by the single market with ever fewer internal border controls.
Europe has one of the world's largest markets of counterfeit products.
The existence and the trade volume of these products seriously violate intellectual property rights.
More decisive measures to correct the situation should be identified and put into action.
Answering these challenges is above all a question of more harmonised and determined cooperation among the customs authorities of different Member States.
However, all in all, the development of the European single market has been an undeniable success and deserves to be celebrated as one of the key factors contributing to the wealth of the whole of the EU.
<D>
- Madam President, allow me to explain why I voted against the Florenz report on climate change.
Policies relating to climate change are based to a large extent on alarmist ideologies.
The evidence for climate change is controversial.
Hypotheses blaming man for this change are also, to say the least, disputable.
Man is seen as a creature who is harmful to the environment without making a beneficial contribution.
I do not share this view.
The content of the report is a direct consequence of an ongoing fashionable green ideology stating that we must put nature and the planet first, that we cannot take care of people, their needs and interests.
The few amendments to the report calling for further progress on nuclear energy, and supporting headway on nuclear fusion, can hardly mitigate its negative impact on the whole European economy and agriculture.
I voted against the report because it is a blueprint for substantial political problems.
Instead of bringing forward ideas that nobody is interested in, we should take care of people and their needs.
<D>
. - (RO) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that we have this opportunity this evening to discuss such an important issue, the economic crisis, which is affecting not only Member States, but the whole world.
We therefore need to find solutions to this problem.
Mutual support for Member States should be one of the steps to be taken in this direction.
Bearing in mind that we want EU Member States to resort to this fund when necessary, we must welcome the decision made by European political leaders at last week's summit.
I believe that this European financial assistance fund for Member States needs to be increased to at least EUR 25 billion for one reason: we need to save this market economy.
Before I finish, I would like to express my confidence that we will take the measures required to overcome this crisis, both at a European and global level.
We urgently need to find the resources required to avert the problems which our citizens are going to be faced with, such as unemployment.
We all wish the best for the EU.
<D>
(CS) Mr President, Parliament decided outside the scope of the Kyoto Protocol to include aviation activities in the scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading.
Although aviation's share of overall greenhouse gas emissions is only about 3%, in 15 years the aviation sector's emissions have doubled.
Today Europe has confirmed yet again its leadership in combating climate change.
However, we need to strike a balance.
It is only right that a proportion of allowances be allocated by auction rather than distributed free of charge, which will promote the development of young societies.
Auction revenues should be used to develop technologies to reduce CO2 emissions in the aviation sector and not for other purposes.
It is well known that another strategy for reducing emissions is the integrated management of flight schedules.
I am strongly in favour of a single starting date for both intercontinental and internal flights.
The Commission has to persuade third countries to join by the end of 2011.
I consider this a necessary condition for fair competition between all European airlines regardless of the company's address.
The goal of reducing global warming by two degrees by the year 2020 involves convincing the rest of the world first of all.
The international conference in Bali will soon show how successful we are in this respect.
<D>
Mr President, one of the key recommendations of the European Parliament is to combat protectionism both within and outside the EU.
I firmly believe that protectionism undermines, rather than defends, citizens' rights, but that Europe should be looking at its own backyard first.
Our highest priority should now be the removal of protectionist barriers within the EU.
In order to make the European single market a reality we need to enhance the four fundamental freedoms of the common market, especially the free movement of workers.
Our report acknowledges that many labour markets remain segmented and that worker mobility is still low.
How surprising!
Have we forgotten that most citizens of the new Member States still need a permit to work in other EU countries?
Four years after the 'big bang' enlargement we have seen no major disruption of labour markets in the older Member States, and no influx to justify the transitional restrictions.
On the contrary, the proliferation of complex national quotas and qualitative restrictions in Member States is undermining the Lisbon Strategy, which aims to ensure flexible markets and a mobile labour force.
We have only two years left to become the world's most competitive economy, and to boost competitiveness and create more jobs and growth, but I am hopeful.
In Romania, my country, the average economic growth rate has been about 6% over the past five years, and the unemployment rate is down to 4%.
We are now starting to have concerns about the lack of labour.
Opening frontiers to third-country workers is necessary, but our top priority should be to lift the EU's internal barriers first.
Workers from the 12 new Member States should be granted priority to go and work in any other EU Member State, and the transitional arrangements should be removed.
One cannot possibly justify calling for external workers while restrictions still apply to our citizens.
Restrictions are unjustifiable and incompatible with the Lisbon Strategy, and removing them is the only way to achieve a competitive and innovative Europe.
<D>
- (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I speak on behalf of our fellow Member, Mr Toubon.
I should like firstly to thank Mr Popa, who has done an excellent job of trying to reach a compromise that is acceptable to us all, despite the extreme positions adopted on this issue by some members of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance.
The report raises the important issue of finding a balance between security and fundamental freedoms on the Internet.
Indeed, while for many this new technology is synonymous with progress and opportunities, it is not without its risks.
For example, it is essential to guarantee freedom of expression and of information on this new medium, while ensuring at the same time that respect is shown for other fundamental freedoms, such as the protection of people's private lives and of personal data, and for intellectual property.
The rapporteur, Mr Lambrinidis, who has done an excellent job, has thus taken into account the new types of Internet crime and the dangers they pose, especially for children.
Unfortunately the report remains more ambiguous and even dangerous on other points.
The aim of the amendments tabled by Mrs Hieronymi, Mr Mavrommatis and Mr Toubon, is to make it clear that attacks on fundamental freedoms should not be supported in the name of freedom of expression and of information.
The Member States and Internet operators should keep some room for manoeuvre so that they can find the best solutions for ensuring that the rights of some do not completely prevent those of others from being exercised.
Laws must apply to the Internet as they do everywhere else.
The Internet cannot be a virtual space where an act that constitutes an offence in the real world is deemed permissible, and even protected simply by the effect of technology and the way in which it is used.
The rule of law in our democratic societies is at stake.
<D>
Madam President, I think this is a historic day, as we are finally going to deal with this vexed question and this anomaly in the internal market.
I think we should remember briefly how we come to be here.
I was involved, before I came into this Parliament, with the issue that has given rise to these discrepancies in the market.
Frankly, intellectual property and its sanctity are not an issue here.
In fact, this is actually a much more fundamental issue.
Intellectual property is, after all, a right granted to producers, but it is a right that they must not abuse in an anti-competitive way.
In a number of countries, particularly in the United Kingdom, where this movement started, it was quite clear to the Monopolies Commission at the time that the car manufacturers were abusing that monopoly, and that is why it was removed.
Now, that does not in any way undermine the importance of intellectual property protection.
I just want to make that clear to a number of colleagues who have made that point.
The second point I want to make is to draw the attention of colleagues to an important measure that the Internal Market Committee introduced a few months ago - and I was privileged to be rapporteur - on motor vehicle type approval.
For the first time, we now have a regime in which independently manufactured parts that are a critical part of the safety and environmental systems of vehicles have to be tested independently to the same standards as the vehicle manufacturer's own parts.
That new proposal effectively completely removes the argument about safety that I heard Mr Strož repeat yet again.
That is gone: this Parliament has made sure it is gone.
So, we have dealt with the two crucial issues, and I think it is about time we moved forward.
I am pleased that the car manufacturers have finally accepted the fact that you cannot re-regulate a market.
Colleagues, you know we cannot re-regulate a market.
This is an extraordinary anomaly.
It has been allowed to go on for a long time.
It is something that we want to do to complete the internal market.
I think we are being very generous in offering a five-year transition period.
I hope the Council will accept that.
Let us put this issue to rest and let us go on and tackle the real issue, which is how we have a thriving car industry in the future.
<D>
(EL) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, today's package of amendments to the provisions of the Structural Fund regulations is an important step towards simplifying and directly activating resources, both at European and at national and local level.
It is an important step in invigorating the European economy in the middle of an unprecedented crisis which is harming the real economy at all levels more and more every day.
It is a step which corresponds to the European Parliament's long-standing demand for even simpler procedures and greater flexibility in the application of the rules of the Structural Funds.
What is the response of today's leaders to the massive crisis we are currently experiencing?
Where are the European policies?
To ensure that the required liquidity reaches its recipients and the implementation of projects starts immediately, the Member States need to respond to the circumstances.
Cohesion policy resources must be made available immediately and promptly to the real beneficiaries at regional and local level.
The purpose of activating operational programmes should be to safeguard jobs, entrepreneurship and competitiveness and make use of the natural, cultural and human resources of each region.
Only the immediate activation of programmes will help to protect cohesion and prevent the creation of new divergences.
May today's crisis be an opportunity for us to unite our voice, so that there is a European voice in solving all the problems we are experiencing.
<D>
(NL) Firstly, I must congratulate Mr Schmidt on his report.
As someone representing Sweden, which is not a member of the euro area, he has produced a very good, very clear report.
To my mind he has met the criteria for membership on Sweden's behalf.
Last week the European Central Bank put up the interest rate.
Clearly the European Central Bank and its President, Mr Trichet, take the Bank's mandate and the Maastricht criteria seriously.
I am glad that the ECB is independent.
The ECB must be protected against political meddling, by national authorities, for example, and I am glad too to hear Mr Juncker confirming this on behalf of the Eurogroup.
And the European Central Bank has responded well to the financial crisis.
It moved in a timely fashion to guarantee liquidity for the markets.
This has stabilised interest rates for the time being.
The crisis in the banking sector has been a wake-up call.
The lack of transparency in the financial risks to which institutions are exposed is producing losses which may be considerable.
A debate is currently under way in the European Parliament on financial scrutiny.
The European Central Bank can play a crucial role here, because it is well briefed by the central banks of the Member States.
But the Treaty says nothing about this.
I believe we need closer cooperation between the central banks and the European Central Bank, financial markets and regulatory authorities.
The European Central Bank should play a greater part in scrutiny and oversight.
It is in a position to organise the cross-border exchange of information, certainly when it comes to financial stability.
The ECB has proved its worth.
We must make use of its power in order to strengthen financial scrutiny.
<D>
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have been addressing the Interim Agreement with Turkmenistan here in the European Parliament for nearly three years.
Almost three years ago we had reached the point where the Committee on International Trade had adopted a report, but it was rejected by plenary, one of the reasons being that the Council and the Commission stopped working on this issue and Parliament said that, if the Commission and the Council are not pushing ahead here, then there is no need for us to either.
I am particularly pleased that we are in a different situation today, even if the situation in Turkmenistan is still a long way from meeting our standards.
Human rights are still disregarded in many areas and there is still a great deal of justified criticism in terms of the lack of democratic structures in this country.
Individual freedoms are very restricted.
Freedom of information in this country leaves a great deal to be desired.
At the moment, according to information channelled to us by non-government organisations, a campaign is under way to remove satellite dishes and hence further obstruct access to the free media.
The education system still fails to come up to the standard that we want in order to educate people in an enlightened and, more importantly, informed manner in terms of democracy and human rights.
Also, the situation in the prisons and the question of political prisoners and Red Cross access to these prisons is still totally unsatisfactory and unexplained.
On the other hand, there is also a great deal of unjustified criticism which keeps being passed on to us.
There have been numerous false reports by so-called non-government organisations over recent years.
Several non-government organisations have given me the impression that they are perhaps fronting for companies from other countries which have an interest in doing what they can to prevent talks from taking place between the European Union and Turkmenistan.
It is my impression that behind many of the statements and much of the false information leaked to the European Union there was a very deliberate interest in obstructing talks between the European Union and Turkmenistan.
I am thinking here of reports that all the hospitals in the country have closed with the exception of two in the capital, that all but two libraries have closed, that there has been an outbreak of plague because medical conditions are allegedly so appalling.
These reports have all proved to be false.
So what is the main problem?
It is absolutely impossible to get a realistic picture of this country, mainly because its government does not let us take a proper look at it and because we, as the European Union, unfortunately have no foreign office to take the necessary action there.
However, we can see that the new president has started numerous reforms.
The European Union's Central Asia strategy adopted a while ago here in Parliament focuses on the Central Asian countries.
This Interim Agreement could possibly be a first small step to show the Turkmens that we are taking up the reins of dialogue, are pushing ahead with dialogue and also want to help them follow the slow - but hopefully constant - path towards human rights and democracy.
Our resolution, which was tabled here in Parliament as a resolution by numerous groups, clearly addresses many of the causes for criticism.
It also clearly addresses some of the positive developments which we can see, but the point for us is that we do not want to give out any free tickets to ride, we most certainly do not want to sell out on values that we hold dear to Turkmenistan; we want to defend and maintain our values.
That is why the partnership and cooperation agreement should not be a foregone conclusion and, as the previous speaker said, the Commission and the Council must make clear statements about the possible suspension of the Interim Agreement if Parliament should so demand at some point in the future.
Parliament has set out numerous questions in writing to the Commission and the Council.
I would be delighted if you could examine them and give us very emphatic answers, so that hopefully we can together get this Interim Agreement under way tomorrow.
<D>
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in two minutes I cannot draft the peace plan, but I can make one or two points.
It is time we reviewed our vocabulary, for it is not dialogue we need but negotiations.
This term 'dialogue' tells us nothing.
War is being waged there, and it takes negotiation to end wars.
That is the point.
And how does one negotiate?
Graham Watson is right: if the European Union pursues a strategy of its own - and not the US strategy - it must do the following: firstly, it must negotiate with those who hold power in Gaza - and that means Hamas - so that they do what they have always said they would, namely organise a ceasefire.
Then the other side will arrange for humanitarian aid to be taken to Gaza.
That is called negotiation - you give something, and we shall give something.
Secondly, we must say tell the Israelis that, if they want to negotiate with the Palestinians, there is one thing they must do, namely put an immediate stop to any settlement-building and do so visibly, otherwise they will receive no more assistance from the European Union.
That is what I call negotiation.
I am in a position of power and try to exploit it.
Otherwise the whole business is pointless.
I believe in this dialogue, and we shall pursue it.
I believe in playing politics, in simply telling my interlocutor that things cannot go on like this.
Israel's colonial policy is endangering the State of Israel.
We must say that to the Israelis.
And we must tell the Palestinians that the latest attack has endangered the Palestinians and that the attacks must stop.
Once the European Union finally makes the transition from dialogue to political negotiation, which includes exploiting positions of power, there will be a chance of progress in the region.
In short, dialogue can wait - the political cards must be played first.
(Applause)
<D>
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, the preservation of biological diversity represents a challenge for the contemporary world.
It is not only beauty that is at issue, but also the balance of nature and the good of mankind.
For many years now we have been aware of the problem of chemical contamination and of other detrimental effects of civilisation, such as the deterioration of the environment, climate change, pollution, deforestation and damage to habitats.
The greenhouse effect has become a topical issue of late.
Unfortunately, the problem of biological contamination caused by genetically modified organisms has been disregarded, and we have all been complicit in that.
We have overlooked the fact that whilst chemical contamination can be reversed over time, biological contamination is often irreversible.
We must therefore take an unambiguous decision as to whether we are in favour of biological diversity or in favour of GMOs.
We have to decide what we care about most: human beings and their environment or the interests of Monsanto and similar companies that are deriving huge profits from GMOs.
If we wish to preserve biological diversity we must also ensure that the most seriously threatened natural species are identified.
It would then be possible to set targets for their protection and prevent the extinction of other species in the future.
We should remember that it is easy to cause damage but often impossible to reverse it.
<D>
(DE) Madam President, I should like to start by objecting to the spirit of something we heard a few minutes ago, namely that our labour market was being overrun by foreign workers.
Secondly, I should have liked to see a clearer, more unambiguous report by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
Confidence in the social cohesion of the European Union can be achieved only if fundamental social rights are defined as primary European law.
We should send the Council, the Commission, the Member States and the European Court of Justice a stronger signal, and not content ourselves with just calling for a balance between fundamental rights and the freedoms of movement of the internal market.
This will not effect change.
Like liberties, fundamental social rights are human rights, and must not be curtailed as a result of internal market freedoms of movement.
The important points here are that we must defend and improve the European social model and that it is high time we introduced a social progress clause as a binding protocol to the existing EU Treaties.
It is time that the Posting of Workers Directive was amended such as to prevent requirements on wages and on minimum standards being limited to minimum requirements.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, one of the previous speakers stated that the principle behind all of this must be 'no force'.
No force from either side, as enshrined in international law.
We must insist that international law is upheld, including territorial integrity, non-intervention in the internal affairs of another state, no exertion of influence and adherence to the agreements of August and September.
I hope that this will continue to apply in Geneva.
We must continue to ensure that the European Council decisions of 1 September and the resolutions negotiated by the Commission concerning association agreements, free trade agreements and the European Economic Area Plus, or whatever it is called, are observed, so that the individual countries can be strengthened, stabilised and involved without provocation to other countries and the necessary work can be carried out at the donor conference.
At the same time we must give the Eastern European Member States a feeling of security and solidarity within the European Union and NATO.
I believe that this is also important for psychological reasons.
Commissioner, I am grateful for the fact that you have referred to our mutual economic interdependence, which is the best security policy we could have.
However, the more this interdependence is strengthened and the more it becomes part of the spheres of interest of both parties and these become linked together, the more difficult it will be for us to extract ourselves from this dependence using non-peaceful means.
In this case we must lead the way.
We should also support any moves with legal obligations in which Russia is included, together with the WTO and partnership agreements with the corresponding obligations.
When our economic interdependency is underpinned with legal and contractual measures in this way, we will be able to make progress.
However, this must be based on our interests.
Energy security is one point and in this area there are challenges to be faced throughout the world.
Not without reason have the 5+1 met once again on the subject of Iran and then moved on to their normal work.
This is also happening on other levels.
I have heard that a committee of the European Parliament has once again visited Moscow.
Iran, the Middle East, climate change, terrorism and many other issues: Russia is an essential part of all of this.
We must be open to discussions.
A security partnership with Russia will only function if it is not at the expense of existing alliances and of keeping the USA out of Europe.
This is a condition of a partnership of this kind.
<D>
Mr President, I would like to thank the interpretation staff once again for hanging around for so long, eating into their lunch breaks, listening to our explanations of vote.
If we had not had the Corbett report and all these things that make us give explanations of vote at these times, we could all have gone to lunch a lot earlier.
Firstly, I would like to associate myself with the words of Mr Eoin Ryan.
I thought he eloquently put one of the biggest problems that we have with Afghanistan.
I was also going to make the same points as my wise colleague, Mr David Sumberg.
I cannot believe the general cheek of this place even talking about this subject, when you consider how many of our Member States have got their troops in frontline action in Afghanistan.
I have lots of constituents, two of whom have recently come back in body bags from Afghanistan, and I promise you, no one wants to put troops in harm's way, but this really is a vital cause for us.
I detest the general anti-Americanism of this place.
I certainly do not understand the anti-military feel of this place and there are some people here who are pretty gutless in their actions, who throw stones from the safety of this place, while others are actually putting their lives at risk to improve a situation for us all.
<D>
Madam President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council and Ms Gomes, I want to thank you for everything you have said and for all the work you have done until now.
I believe that this report sends a very important message to the rest of the European Union: that this House wants to look forward; it does not want to look backwards; it wants to be engaged in the future of a democratic and federal Iraq in support of that future.
I will say three things about the report, and I am particularly proud that this report is coming from the European Parliament on the day we celebrate 50 years of the achievements of the European Parliament.
Today we celebrate what we have achieved in reconciliation in Europe.
And the lessons we have learned over the past 50 years are lessons we need to transfer as experience and knowledge to our friends in Iraq so that they can use them and rebuild their country in a successful way.
The report outlines, of course, the achievements, but it does not shy away from the challenges being faced the Federal Republic of Iraq and the Commissioner very aptly outlined them.
I would like to point out one thing as a footnote to her statement.
That is that the achievement on the security front is the primary responsibility of the Iraqis, supported by the internationals of course, but it is the responsibility of the Iraqis.
No one can ensure the security of Iraq except the Iraqis; nobody can ensure the resolution of the political problems except the Iraqi politicians and their political process.
We call for a new strategy, a European strategy for Iraq.
I spent a large part of 2006 working in the Council representation in Baghdad helping them.
The message I was receiving from everyone every day was, 'Where is Europe?
We want to talk to Europe because your experience is vital to us.'
This, today, is a response to that call.
Finally, this House in its report reaffirms the commitment of the European Parliament to support the reconstruction and the building of the Iraqi Parliament, an extremely important role, and thank you Council for recognising the contribution that this Parliament has made by selecting and approving a Delegation for relations with Iraq.
I think today we are faced with a vital challenge: actually to use what we know and what we have in support of political process, not through weapons, but through words, not through arms, but through deeds in Iraq and help the people there.
<D>
(DE) Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Florenz very much for his report, which, unfortunately, has not been a great success, probably partly as a result of the fact that it has been discussed very much in the shadow of the legislative package on climate change.
We must face up to the consequences of climate change; there is no question about that.
It is only the means for doing so chosen by the report that I cannot fully support.
Firstly, it is right that the EU should take the first steps to protect the climate, but it is not beneficial to rush on ahead alone without the involvement of partners.
Europe leading the way is not enough to convince the rest of the world.
A more viable approach must involve the industrial nations and at least China, India and Brazil, otherwise Europe's economy will remain unfairly burdened without there being any measureable effects on global CO2 emissions.
Secondly, with our current level of knowledge, renewable energies cannot completely replace fossil energy sources.
It may be motivating on a political level to demand that, but it is not realistic.
The political will, as great as that may be, will not nullify any physical laws.
Thirdly, biofuels are hailed as environmentally-friendly alternatives.
Their negative side effects on food prices, which are rising as a result of these biofuels, and rainforests, which are being deforested, are not as yet under control.
Fourthly, a means of mobility that protects resources in the long term is a reasonable goal.
Providing incentives may help to achieve this goal.
However, we should consider at what point state intervention is going too far and at what stage we can claim to have knowledge that we do not have today.
No one currently knows which technologies will best meet the mobility needs of individuals in 50 years' time and politicians certainly do not have any better idea of this than engineers do.
Although it started with good intentions, what remains, unfortunately, is a report full of wishful thinking in written form, with moral appeals and pointing fingers.
Unfortunately, the German liberals cannot give their support to this.
<D>
(SL) The enlargement of the European Union has brought growth, peace and stability, as well as making democratisation possible.
The most recent enlargement, which took place five years ago, has been a success story, but today we are faced with an economic situation which requires fast and effective action.
We can see and feel the benefits of full integration into the European Union and the enlargement of the euro zone.
The bulwark provided by the euro has proved a successful safeguard, not only for economic interests within the European Union, but also for those of Wider Europe.
In the European Union, we are experiencing, not 27 economic crises, but one single one, a very serious and deep crisis.
The fastest way for us to solve it will be to team up with other European countries and take coordinated, timely and decisive action.
Protectionism is a retrograde step, but populism is a recipe for economic collapse.
Companies which are growing and expanding have a future.
Similarly, the future of the European Union lies in its continued enlargement and in creating and building on new possibilities and better opportunities.
<D>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, I would like to congratulate Mr Kamall on his excellent work.
The services sector - as he himself acknowledged - is the most important sector almost all over the world.
Even in Africa and Asia it is the most important component of GDP.
However, this strategic sector must now be the driver for economic growth, particularly in countries where there is still a lack of development.
The report does well to comment on the significant growth in trade in services as a vehicle for greater welfare and stability, particularly for countries that still need to develop.
Trade in services also means a knowledge transfer between countries and citizens.
The freedom to carry out such trade, provided that it is contained within a set of shared and respected rules, is therefore fundamental for any growth strategy.
However, no one should try to export or import models for others: each developing country must adopt the proper timescales for its own growth capability.
Therefore, the new road to liberalisation must take into account the fact that governments must satisfy the needs of citizens and not - as has sometimes happened in Africa, unfortunately - sell the opportunity to provide services to public companies linked to the governments of other countries when they are unable to provide their own people with basic services such as water or energy, because clearly there is the risk then of economic, political and security problems, even at international level.
The failure of the Doha Round has unfortunately punished everyone: the European Union, industrialised countries, but above all - we believe - the poorest countries.
Therefore, we hope that with this report we can send out another strong message that we are embarking once more on the harmonious development of the whole of society.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - On the question of the provenance of fish, I would like to point out two facts.
First of all, with regard to fish caught in the wild which often then end up in the processing chain - fish that are caught in the wild by third countries in particular, but also by our own fishermen - we are in the process of adopting a regulation in order to curb illegal fishing activities.
This in itself will strengthen our regime considerably, so that any fish that is illegally caught will not be permitted to enter the Community market, either in its original state or after processing.
That is one aspect of it.
With regard to aquaculture, we are looking at ways and means of ensuring that aquaculture fish that are imported into the Community meet the required health standards and requirements, so that our consumers can be guaranteed that the product that they are eating meets the levels of health protection that we apply to our own products.
That is something which DG SANCO is looking into, and there is also a certification scheme in order to certify that products that enter the Community market conform to the required health standards.
On a question also connected with all this, it is important to underline that we are looking at the possibility of eco-labelling aquaculture products, as I said before.
At first the discussion concentrated only on eco-labelling of fish caught in the wild because the parameters are different.
There, the main scope of eco-labelling is to guarantee that fish are sustainably caught and therefore if fish being sold are fish which are over-exploited, they should not benefit from any eco-labelling.
With eco-labelling of aquaculture fish the parameters are different, so here the basis should be other reasons, such as the fact that the fish are bred in conditions which meet certain environmental, health and sanitary standards.
We are looking at the parameters and obviously we will be coming back to Parliament later with proposals aimed at introducing or facilitating the introduction of, or establishing minimum criteria for the operation of, voluntary eco-labelling schemes in this regard.
Subject: Safety tonnage application
On 13 June 2006, the Court of First Instance ruled in favour of 20 Irish applications seeking safety tonnage, which annuls Commission Decision 2003/245/EC of 4 April 2003 for 20 safety tonnage applications.
The Court found that the Commission had used criteria not provided for in the rules (i.e. vessels have to be at least 5 years old before being eligible to apply for safety tonnage) and that it had exceeded its power.
All the safety tonnage applications were submitted to the Commission before 31 December 2001, as required under Council Decision 97/413/EC (see Article 4(2))
The Court found that the Commission had not applied this article correctly in refusing the safety tonnage application for these individuals.
Could the Commission comment on why this decision was not appealed and why the successful applicants are still awaiting an answer from the Commission, almost two years later, on how it intends to comply with the Court ruling?
<D>
author. - (DE) Mr President, West Africa was once known as a region where there was a great deal of positive development.
Today Sierra Leone has become a synonym for the particular horrors which we have witnessed across Africa over these past few years.
We therefore have a responsibility to ensure that the forthcoming elections not only help to restore democracy but also, and far more importantly, restore justice and the rule of law.
This must include the prosecution of the massive crimes that have taken place in this country.
After all, Europeans were among those who used Mr Taylor as a means by which to enrich themselves from, and in, Sierra Leone.
That is why I believe that the process of dealing with these crimes cannot be allowed to fail due to a lack of funds.
We Europeans have a responsibility in that regard, but I nonetheless believe that the questions that have been raised here are justified.
It is apparent that we will not make progress in the long term with ad hoc tribunals.
It is apparent that what we need in the long term is a single universal jurisdiction to deal with these criminal dictators.
However, that does not help us at the moment.
The first task now is to press ahead with the trials that have already begun and, in particular, to press ahead with securing the conviction of Mr Taylor, for that will send out a warning signal to criminals who are committing crimes against humanity today or who may do so in future: I would mention Zimbabwe's dictator, Mr Mugabe, in this context.
Mr Mugabe must be shown what could happen to him if he continues with his horrendous crimes.
That is why we need uniform criteria and stable institutions to deal with these massive crimes.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, fairy tales usually begin with the words 'once upon a time'.
I should also like to begin my speech like this.
Once upon a time there was a world trade organisation called the WTO, which wanted to create a worldwide balance between supply and demand through totally free trade.
It promised people in the poorest countries a substantial increase in prosperity and people in the rich countries cheap food through the liberalisation of trade.
This is the fairy tale; the reality is somewhat different.
Worldwide free trade in agriculture is not appropriate for fighting global hunger and poverty on a sustained basis.
The World Bank and the WTO need to be aware of this.
Worldwide free trade in agriculture serves only a very few agricultural conglomerates, which export food from the poorest countries without any regard for the food situation itself.
Poverty cannot be combated effectively through global agricultural trade.
People in the poor regions are no longer able to afford food at high farm prices, and farmers in highly developed regions are no longer able to produce food at low farm prices because it is not profitable at that level.
Both clash.
Whether Mr Zoellick from the World Bank, Mr Lamy from the WTO and - unfortunately I do need to say this - my colleague Mr Hökmark from my own group grasp these connections, I very much doubt.
Therefore, nothing much will change in the situation in the near future.
With regard to farm prices in Europe, in 1961 I received 26 cents for 1 kilo of grain.
Two years ago I received 8 cents.
Farm prices cannot therefore be the cause of high food prices!
<D>
(ES) Mr President, the meeting of the Council of Ministers on 18 February will not go down in the history of the EU as a particularly glorious date.
Rather than seeking a solution between the 27, the hot potato of the decision on recognition has been referred to the Member States.
It is always frustrating that, each time we have to make a decision about a sensitive matter at the heart of our continent that affects important principles such as the inviolability of borders, we are not able to speak with one voice.
To complicate matters, the Council conclusions refer to international legality.
It is true that Parliament, like other EU bodies, adopted the Ahtisaari plan, but not as a blank cheque, rather on the understanding that the plan would have the approval of the United Nations Security Council.
Obviously this was not the case, and various conclusions need to be drawn from this.
The first is that it has been said that this case will not set a precedent, that it is a sui generis case, as Mr Wurtz said in his speech.
We need to ask ourselves whether or not we are a Community based on law.
We cannot be so on an à la carte basis.
Obviously this case is going to set a precedent and when international law is flouted it does not come for free and unfortunately there will be consequences.
Secondly, Mr President, how long are we going to be living with a United Nations Security Council in which there is an anachronistic right of veto for the winners of the Second World War enshrined in the San Francisco Charter in 1945?
This is no way to construct an international order or implement fair and effective multilateralism.
Thirdly, Mr President, either the European Union learns once and for all that union is our strength and fragmentation is our weakness, or we will have to renounce our vocation of international leadership in this globalised world and confine ourselves to being what The Economist described us as: the 21st century's most prosperous third world region.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - I can assure the honourable Member that, with regard to the seventh Research Framework Programme (FP7), the Commission systematically collects and publishes, for all to see, clear and detailed statistical data illustrating the implementation of this programme.
It is important to remember that Community funding for research is awarded to beneficiaries on the sole criterion of the scientific excellence of their proposals.
But even though no account is taken of nationality in awarding contracts, we do collect and closely follow the data on the geographic distribution of FP7 beneficiaries and their respective collaborative links.
This gives us an important insight into the level and strength of synergies developed between countries as a result of their participation in FP7 activities.
You can find all of this data, and many other detailed statistics about FP7 implementation, in the statistical annex to the Commission's annual report on research and technological development activities, which we submit every year to the Council and Parliament.
More importantly, all of these reports going back to 1998 are publicly available on line via the Commission's 'Europa' Internet site.
So what does this data tell us?
I cannot reel off here today a long list of statistics, as we do not have time for that, but let me nevertheless give you some few highlights concerning the focus of your question: the relative popularity of FP7 research areas among the Member States.
Information and communication technologies (ICT), health and Marie Curie actions were generally the most popular fields among Member States in terms of the numbers of participations in signed grant agreements.
It should be noted, however, that their popularity is also a function of the size of the budget available to each of these research areas of FP7 and, also, the number and type of signed grant agreements present in the databases at the time of such assessment.
Generally it can be noted that the participation of new Member States is stronger in the fields of security, socioeconomic research and space, and weaker, for example, in ICT and health.
In the country that the honourable Member comes from there is a marked focus on ICT, but relatively weak participation, for example, in health, socioeconomic research and space.
Concerning the response of SMEs to FP7, every year the Commission publishes a detailed assessment of SME participation by country of origin as part of our annual report, which I have mentioned.
Our latest data on SME participation in FP7 indicates that a total of 2 431 SMEs are now participating in FP7 signed grant agreements.
For detailed information I would refer the honourable Member to the report itself.
But, if the honourable Member wishes, I could hand out some of the tables with the relevant information from FP7 here today, because I have them with me.
The actions of the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme are more policy-driven than grant-oriented.
In particular the Entrepreneurship and Innovation Specific Programme (EIP) serves mainly as a policy support programme.
If we look at its main instruments, Enterprise Europe Network exclusively benefits SMEs by providing information on access by different types of SME finance and identifying project-funding opportunities and helping to find technology and business partners.
The EIP Financial Instrument, which accounts for about half of the programmes budget, is also reserved exclusively for SMEs.
By the end of September 2008, around 12 000 SMEs had received financing through the SME Guarantee Facility, with applications received from 17 Member States.
In addition, the first call for proposals on eco-innovation pilot and market replication projects was published in 2008 to carry out actions in the fields of recycling, the food and drink sector, buildings and green business.
The 2008 call notably succeeded in covering the priority given to small and medium-sized enterprises.
In total, 74% of all participations were SMEs.
And lastly, the Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support specific Programme of CIP launched calls for proposals for 2007 and 2008 with a focus on pilot project testing ICT-based innovations, where SMEs receive more than 30% of the total budget.
More importantly, this programme aims at opening up EU-wide markets for such innovations that are supplied by SMEs all across the European Union.
As with FP7 reports, reports relating to the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme are publicly available on the Europa website.

in writing. - I do not share the opinion of my colleagues from the S&D Group, which is why I have abstained from voting.
It does not matter who writes the nonsense: to multiply it is foolishness.
The citizens' initiative is necessary, no doubt, but to collect one million signatures in order to be heard is nonsense.
I would like to ask the rapporteurs if they ever collected signatures themselves.
If they did, they should know that the minimum cost of each signature certified by a notary is 20 euros.
That means 20-30 million euros to introduce a new law.
Who will finance this action?
Only large enterprises are able to do that, not ordinary people.
Is this not then a fake?
A point to remember: MEPs also represent these people.
<D>
Ms Harkin, your point is noted and we will do what we can.
The following questions are addressed to the Commission.
Part one
Subject: Negative impact on business of the international credit crisis
The current international credit crisis, which is leading the US economy into recession, is slowing down the rate of growth at world level.
The effects on the European economy and business are substantial.
Greek and other European companies are already coming under considerable pressure from the increase in imports from non-EU countries whose cheaper products are constantly gaining ground on the market.
At the same time, a fall in European exports is forecast for the current year.
What measures will the Commission take to provide European companies with effective support to survive this crisis and become more commercially competitive at international level?
Which sectors of commerce and which European products does it consider to be most vulnerable?
Which should be protected as a matter of priority and how can that be achieved?
<D>
The situation in the Middle East and the Mediterranean region is at a particularly delicate juncture, as the High Representative has also mentioned in her speech.
I believe that this is an appropriate opportunity for the EU to focus on the peace process in the region.
Israel is one of the European Union's biggest trade partners, while students from the whole of Europe have access to study centres in Israel, thanks to the university international exchange programmes.
I should also mention that the Middle East is where the challenges of the future are already taking shape.
The management of drinking water is one example of this.
The Arab revolutions have generated a climate of instability in the Mediterranean region, which has a particular effect on Israel.
Recently, due to such security risks, the step was taken to close a border point, leaving Kerem Shalom as the only commercial crossing which is completely secure.
The Israeli authorities are focusing their efforts at this location on ensuring a normal flow of civilian and commercial traffic.
In this context, I feel that it is vital to resume as quickly as possible the negotiations on reaching a peaceful solution.
Indeed, the EU's involvement in this process may provide the support needed for this dialogue to be carried out in ideal conditions.
<D>
The joint motion for a resolution on the EU 2020 strategy is intended to replace the admittedly unsuccessful Lisbon Strategy.
Employment rates in Europe average 69% among people aged 20-64 and are still considerably lower than in other parts of the world.
Young people have been hard hit by the crisis, with an unemployment rate in excess of 21%.
Demographic ageing is accelerating.
Investment in the innovation market is seriously overdue.
The new strategy calls for these trends to be reversed in a particularly difficult economic environment.
What sets the report apart is its insistence on the importance of research and innovation as a vehicle for economic recovery and growth in national economies.
The European Parliament is calling on the Commission to increase its budget in this specific sector even more and it is important for Greece that we stress this specific point.
Low productivity is directly linked to the lack of new and innovative ideas.
The new strategy is a first-class chance for our country to use Community resources to produce new, innovative ideas which will make a positive contribution towards invigorating competitiveness and encouraging the creation of new jobs.
<D>
in writing. - Member States have a responsibility to their peoples to plan and deliver health care.
Health is not a commodity to be bought and sold on the internal market.
This proposal is a disgrace.
It shows the Commission is blindly pursuing its discredited and obsolete liberalisation agenda.
It just wants to privatise everything it can and to further centralise power in its own hands.
It discriminates against less wealthy people in wealthy countries, and against all but the super-rich in less wealthy countries.
It is a charter for the destruction of public health services in Member States.
The European Commission should hang their heads in shame and should withdraw this proposal immediately.
<D>
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner Hübner, ladies and gentlemen, this year's budgetary procedure is special because it is the last one to obey the rules that have applied in the past.
As of next year we will be establishing our budget according to the procedure set out in the Lisbon Treaty.
That means our Parliament will have to concentrate more carefully because we will have to express our political will in budgetary items and budgetary figures at a single reading.
We will no longer be able to rectify, to amend compromises we have reached, or to make up for mistakes at a second reading.
The first and indeed only reading must remain and must serve as a workable basis for negotiations with the Council up to the end of the year.
It is therefore important for us to emphasise that alongside the 2009 budgetary procedure we expect to make preparations together with the Council and the Commission to ensure that we conduct the budgetary procedure in accordance with the Lisbon Treaty.
Our current budgetary procedure is, however, somewhat different already.
At the suggestion of the Working Party on Parliamentary Reform, the Committee on Budgets has decided it will no longer submit our usual guidelines in response to the Commission's Annual Policy Strategy in the form of an initial motion for a resolution in plenary, but will instead present our proposal on the budgetary framework and priorities for 2009.
The groups are responsible for the APS resolution, which will address all the policy areas.
We in the Committee on Budgets have concentrated on the overarching budgetary concerns we consider especially important and have set them out in 11 paragraphs.
I want to draw particular attention to three aspects.
Firstly, it is clear that our budgetary cloth has been cut very closely, i.e. it is a very tight fit.
The margins for the individual headings are very small.
We cannot fund political priorities that would urgently need budgetary flanking measures, such as playing a practical role in climate policy, without putting earlier priorities at risk.
The same applies to funding growth and employment or a sustainable Europe.
If we take, for example, Heading 1A we see that we can under no circumstances finance any new agencies with available funds.
We will have to stick to our old, but simple and eminently reasonable principle of 'new tasks, new money'.
Secondly, it is clear see that Heading 4 is chronically under-funded.
The picture there remains the same year after year.
We expect the Commission to present us with a preliminary draft budget that has analysed the requirements precisely and is realistic.
We want at last to use the flexibility instrument for the purpose for which it was introduced, namely for unforeseen needs.
We do not want it to have been swallowed up, in part or even in full, by the end of the year.
Thirdly, we are firmly resolved to inform the Commission before Parliament's summer recess of our intentions regarding pilot projects and preparatory actions.
We expect the Commission to leave us adequate margin for manoeuvre for this parliamentary instrument in the preliminary draft budget, and to do so for all headings.
We certainly noticed that it has not included the pilot projects and preparatory actions in the tables attached to the Annual Policy Strategy for 2009.
In conclusion, we are resolved not to go beyond the financial framework but are very clearly aware of the restrictions and problems and therefore hope for good cooperation with the Council and the Commission.
<D>
I would like to say that the amending budget that we have just approved, to the sum of EUR 13 400 000, with effect only from 1 May, thus covering half a year, is very unwise.
The part of it that relates to increasing human resources for Parliamentary committees and groups to the sum of EUR 4 million can be justified because the Treaty of Lisbon is making new legislative demands of Parliament.
Increasing MEPs' funds for hiring assistants by EUR 8 million, however, means that next year, it will not be 8 million, but 16 million, and this is clearly excessive, as in the coming year, a new increase of EUR 1 500 per month is planned for Members, which amounts to not 16, but EUR 32 million.
At a time when we are seeing massive unemployment and social crisis in all our countries, moving towards increases in resources for Members is not sustainable unless, at the same time, we have the courage to cut down on the expenses and allowances to which we are entitled as Members, and which are by no means all completely justified.
I fail to understand how, for a day of travelling, an MEP can receive EUR 300 in allowances, plus a subsidy for the distance travelled and a subsidy for the time taken, provisions that are entirely tax-free.
We can cut undue expenses and then debate how we can increase our means for law making.
Not doing this at the same time simply shows a disregard for the difficulties that our constituents are experiencing.
We have a duty to set a good example, but today we are setting a bad one.
<D>
(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first and foremost I would like to compliment and congratulate our rapporteurs and the general rapporteur, our friend Kyösti Virrankoski, and the entire EP delegation, expertly led by Mr Böge.
I also congratulate the Commission and, more unusually, the Council Presidency, which dared to take up its responsibilities.
Minister, if there were a European légion d'honneur, I feel you would richly deserve it.
The main concern I and many of my colleagues had in relation to the 2008 budget was ensuring full Community financing for the launch of the Galileo project, and consequently the European Technology Institute, without jeopardising the funding for programmes aimed at implementing the Lisbon Strategy.
The result has been achieved: this is good news for Europe as a whole, and also good news we can explain easily and simply to our fellow citizens, who understand its scope.
If I can put on my LIBE Chairman's cap for a moment, I wish to express my satisfaction that the Commission on Budgets supported the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs concerning the elimination of the reserves in connection with SIS II and Frontex.
These are two essential instruments for the surveillance of the EU's external borders, and we must increase their operational capability.
On the other hand, I request that we leave in reserve all appropriations relating to the European Return Fund until Parliament and the Council have adopted the proposal for a directive on common standards and procedures in Member States for returning illegally staying third-country nationals.
<D>
If the United Nations and the various agencies and organisations that are associated with it are supposed to be, by their nature, a mirror of the world, it is natural that the image thus reflected is not one that we would desire or would like to construct.
These considerations are necessary in relation to the debate on the United Nations Human Rights Council.
To debate and decide, by voting, on human rights in a world with countries that do not pay any attention to them can be expected to have a bizarre result.
This is not only a question of legitimacy.
It is, above all, a question of language.
What evaluative standard on human rights can one suppose the Governments of Libya or Zimbabwe share with democratic states that are answerable to their populations?
None, of course.
However, it is precisely to facilitate dialogue between those who speak different languages that diplomacy exists.
Among equals mediation is not necessary.
Thus, the existence of places of dialogue must be a policy to be stimulated and promoted.
Otherwise, I cannot believe that we can or should have as a standard for our values and our actions something that is decided in such a context.
<D>
(PL) This report is related to the important objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy.
I will remind you all that over a 10-year period, the number of people with higher education is to rise by 10% - from 30% to 40% - and spending by Member States on research and development is to rise to 3%.
It is mainly the universities which will benefit from this money and carry out the research.
We should, therefore, thoroughly investigate the systems which have been the most successful in other parts of the world.
I am talking about American methods related to partnership between business and university, and how to adapt all the results of scientific research to the market, so that what are often wonderful scientific achievements are not left on the shelf but are put to practical use, which means in business.
Another matter is the need for the effective introduction of a system of education grants and attracting businesses into the system.
Doctoral programmes should be strongly supported, using the European Social Fund and programmes which are already in existence, such as the Marie Curie programme.
How can clear schemes of public partnership be created, mainly as part of technology parks and enterprise incubators?
How can we get involved with small and medium-sized enterprises, and also get students involved with SMEs?
All these things are very important.
I think it is important not to invest exclusively in the area of technology, either, which is an important area.
We should also invest in a system for arts and humanities, which should also have an area of cooperation with public bodies and with business.
A final remark: today, China has as many students as there are in the whole of the European Union.
Therefore, talking about achieving common objectives is our common task, and I think the participation of business in the dialogue will be an effective way of beating competition from around the world.
<D>
in writing. - (RO) The European Union needs a new institutional framework after the Treaty of Nice, and the Lisbon Treaty, although less ambitious than the European Constitution, is a good text.
18 Member States have ratified the Lisbon Treaty in their national parliaments.
Ireland decided the ratification by referendum, and the Irish citizens rejected the Treaty.
In 2001, Ireland voted against the Treaty of Nice as well and, one year later, it ratified it.
The vote of the Irish people shows that this country's population considers the Community institutional construction a complicated one.
It is our duty to explain to the European citizens the need for and the provisions of this treaty.
This Treaty deals with the issue of climate change, defines the European economy as a social market economy, emphasizes the need for a common energy policy and, in particular, gives legal value to the European Charter of Fundamental Rights.
The Reform Treaty enhances the level of democracy by increasing the power of the European Parliament and allows half of the national parliaments to reject a legislative project if it is deemed that it infringes the principle of subsidiary.
The vote of the Irish people shows us that we need responsibility and more dialogue, that we need to explain more and better the provisions of this new treaty to the European citizens, as well as the reasons why it is necessary.
<D>
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Madam President, more people work in health than any other area.
The groups of health workers we instantly think of are doctors, nurses, pharmacists and dentists, who are supported by radiologists, lab technicians, researchers, therapists, biochemists and an army of administrators and staff who keep health services functioning.
There is also a second group of professionals: the herbal physicians, chiropractors, osteopaths, homeopaths and nutritionists who focus on a more natural approach to health.
Lastly, there are the family carers, the largest single group of health workers who labour day and night without pay in the health sphere.
Going back to the first group, in this report, the Commission is concerned that the number of professionals working in mainstream healthcare is not sufficient to meet the needs of the growing demand.
The Commission further stresses the need to attract young people to choose these professions.
However, in some countries, this is not the problem.
In Ireland last month, 3 500 young people took an exam in the hope of securing one of a few hundred medical school places.
Similarly, there will be far more young people applying for nursing, therapies, etc., than our universities are willing to train.
Commissioner, it is not a question of attracting young people.
It is a question of allowing them to train.
Our secondary students in Ireland are working towards a career in medicine, but it is, unfortunately, made unattainable by a rationing system that is out of touch with demand, which leaves us with severe shortages of qualified professionals.
I know that similar disconnects between training and demand exist in other European countries.
I would suggest that, in working to attract young people to this profession, you will only frustrate them until we provide them with the opportunity to gain these skills.
Having not allowed these students to train and thereby creating an artificial shortage, we then, of necessity, bring in medical personnel from third countries - even the poorest countries - leaving their own people without medical help and creating a brain drain.
The second group of health professionals I mentioned, like herbal physicians, were unfortunately completely left out of this report.
To leave them out fails to acknowledge the valuable contribution they make in keeping Europeans healthy and is out of touch with the wishes of many Europeans who seek their help.
This sector is very important.
The Commission's apparent attempts to suppress it with directives, like the Vitamin and Mineral Supplements Directive, further compound this growing gulf between EU policy and people's everyday health choices.
Finally, I would like to make reference to the third and largest single group of health workers: the family carer.
These are the people who care for dependant older people and those with disabilities.
We need them more every year, not less.
As Europe ages and the number of people with disabilities increases, we cannot take them for granted.
The only way we are going to keep these essential carers is if we support them in their work.
Finally, our health force is more important than ever.
The Commission is right to say that there are new and re-emerging threats to health, such as communicable diseases.
Yet the Commission should also take careful note that every chronic disorder related to the immune system dysfunction is on the increase, for example, asthma, allergy, multiple sclerosis, autism, diabetes, epilepsy, fibromyalgia and many more.
I would advise the Commission to look at every one of these diseases that is on the rise and try to understand what is triggering these epidemics because, allowing them to increase unchecked and to affect more and more people, is both cruel and unsustainable.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - (EL) Madam President, first I all, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Wallis, and the draftsmen of the opinions, Mr Martin, Mr Brepoels and Mrs Mathieu, for their exceptional work.
In particular, I should like to thank the chairman of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection, Mrs McCarthy, for her positive contribution as regards this specific proposal.
The fact that agreement was reached at first reading demonstrates the political will of the Community institutions to deal promptly with the two main problems relating to the trade in seal products, namely the fragmentation of the internal market and the need to safeguard animal welfare.
This particular agreement contains three decisive elements: the first relates to the harmonisation of the internal market and is a ban on the trade in seal products on the European Union market.
It will apply both to products produced here and to imported products.
As you no doubt know, seals are hunted both inside and outside the Community.
They are used to produce products such as meat, oil, blubber and products from their organs, fur and skin.
These products are traded on various markets, including the Community market.
For some of these products, such as Omega 3 capsules or tanned skins or seal furs, it is difficult, if not impossible for consumers to distinguish them from similar products which do not come from seals.
Seal hunting and the way it is carried out has resulted in the expression of serious reaction and concern by the public and by numerous governments which are particularly enlightened about animal welfare.
These concerns are caused by the way in which seals are hunted, the methods used to kill them and the pain which they cause.
The public's indignation is clear from its massive participation in the relevant public dialogue, but it is also eloquently expressed in the very large number of letters and petitions which I have received over the past two years.
The citizens can now be sure that seal products will no longer be available on the market.
A second important element in the proposal is the logical exemption of Inuit and other indigenous communities.
The aim is not to touch the basic economic and social acquis of these communities, which have traditionally depended on seal hunting.
It should be noted that this sort of hunting is an historical element of their culture and cultural identity and is a source of income which contributes to their survival.
The third element is the exemption for small-scale hunting.
Thus fishermen engaged in incidental seal hunting will be allowed, but only for the purpose of sustainable management of marine resources, to place seal products on the market on a not-for-profit basis, in order to cover their related expenses.
In accordance with the fundamental principle of this regulation, there must be no commercial aspect to this specific activity.
The Commission will approve detailed application measures clarifying how the above two exemptions are to be applied under the comitology procedure and following scrutiny by Parliament.
I hope that Parliament, like the Council and the Commission, will support this specific compromise package overall.
The text in question makes provision for the harmonisation of the internal market and, at the same time, addresses the concerns of European citizens about animal welfare in connection with seal hunting.
The European Commission is in a position to accept in full the compromise package, in order to reach agreement on the regulation in question at first reading.
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Animal Testing Directive is based on the 3Rs principle.
Our objective is the replacement, reduction and refinement of animal testing.
In order to achieve this, we need to develop and promote alternative methods.
Thirdly, we must find a compromise between animal welfare and research, while placing the emphasis on human health.
Commissioner, you have also emphasised that we need to have the same standards in all Member States.
The current legislative proposal is based on the Community Action Plan on the Protection and Welfare of Animals and on the animal health strategy.
We want to ensure a high level of protection and high standards in the European Union and throughout the world.
However, the complete abolition of animal testing without other methods being available as an adequate replacement would make the majority of the research based on animal experimentation in the European Union almost impossible.
Research projects would move abroad, we would lose the huge amount of knowledge that we currently have and we would make ourselves completely dependent on other countries.
Therefore, it is important to find a compromise and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has presented a good compromise.
Admittedly it is not an easy balancing act, but for people who are ill it may be a matter of survival.
The result of the vote in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on 31 March meets these requirements.
We must support this compromise which was accepted by 72% of the committee.
Therefore, I call on all Members of this House to reject all the more far-reaching amendments that have been submitted and to vote in favour of the amendments from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament.
My warm thanks go not only to the rapporteur, but also to many of my fellow Members throughout Parliament.
<D>
We need to recognise that sufficient progress has not been made in integrating Roma since the Commission launched its first appeal to this effect in 2005.
An initial step towards this would be to create a policy for promoting education for Roma.
This policy has to be handled not only by the state, but also by non-governmental organisations which no longer need to make it their main objective to identify acts of discrimination, but to educate ethnic groups.
This solution is not only based on making the public authorities face up to their responsibilities, but the Roma communities as well.
Some of the causes of unemployment which Roma face are due to illiteracy, a lack of education and professional qualifications, not to mention a lack of access to information.
Educational reform for this ethnic group can be carried out in three ways: reducing the level of illiteracy, ensuring studies are completed, and professional specialisation and reconversion.
This reform needs to respect Roma's specific culture and traditions, while also linking the education system to the values of European culture and civilisation.
I invite the Commission to draw up a single plan for integrating Roma at European level, based on cooperation between existing inter-governmental and NGO projects.
This also includes projects involving representatives from educational institutions.
The aim should be to raise the status of access to high-quality education so that it becomes a basic objective of the Community's policies.
<D>
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have also been eager to take the floor to express my thanks for the work that has been done, above all by Mr Sacconi, who has by now accumulated experience that helps him to resolve even the most difficult of cases, but also of course by the French Presidency, the Council and the Commission.
Their concerted efforts have enabled us to finalise all of these climate dossiers and this one in particular regarding the automobile sector which, as many have said, raised concerns due to the current economic situation.
Many of the speakers today have said that these are ambitious targets, from the initial ones for 2012 to the final ones for 2020, and that it was a wise decision to choose this single timeframe, which also applies to other reports that we will be adopting over the next few days.
I also agree with the decision to introduce the modulated penalty system gradually, and the possibility of taking into account reductions achieved through the use of eco-innovations.
All of these things stemmed from the trialogue among the institutions and, in my opinion, have enabled us to find solutions that lower the economic cost for manufacturers at this sensitive time, without affecting the general targets.
An example of this is the introduction of super credits for cars emitting less than 50 g of CO2 per kilometre.
That said, I too would like to point out that, in all likelihood, the approach taken whereby the limit value of emissions will increase in line with vehicle weight will mean that smaller vehicles will not obey the general rule that 'he who pollutes the most, pays the most'.
We are nonetheless pleased with the outcome and are happy to vote in favour of this report.
<D>
in writing. - (PL) Cohesion policy, on which about 33% of the EU budget is spent, is of vital importance to all EU countries.
Poland is pleased to participate in any actions relating to the full economic integration of society in Europe and to minimise disparities at the micro-regional level.
I believe that the measures taken under the cohesion policy are fundamental to promoting sustainable development and eliminating unemployment, poverty and social exclusion, which constitute grave social and economic problems in Europe.
Cooperation between all European countries and the exchange of experiences are of particular importance in this regard.
The problems that are slowing down the EU's sustainable development, including low incomes, poor infrastructure and low social mobility, relate principally to rural areas.
The situation is aggravated by the growing exodus of people from the countryside and the increased social exclusion in these areas.
In addition, among the problems faced by European cohesion policy at the beginning of the 21st century, are issues that are external in character, such as, for example, the growing development differences between the European Union and the USA.
In the years 1995-2005 productivity growth in Europe was much lower than in the United States or in Japan.
This has a significant effect on reducing the competitiveness of the European market.
I would like to thank Mr Harangozó for drawing these issues to our attention.
<D>
Russia is a country in which the fundamental principles of democracy are often not respected.
It is notorious for violating human rights, and restricting freedom of expression, including freedom of opinion.
President Medvedev and Prime Minister Putin exert their influence over the Russian media.
The latter are therefore unable to serve their fundamental purpose, which is to disseminate information in a reliable manner.
We should nonetheless bear in mind that Russia is one of our main partners.
Russia plays a leading role on the international stage.
It is also a major energy supplier and an important trading partner.
In my view we should speak out against Russia loudly and clearly.
We should criticise it for its shortcomings in terms of democracy, for its failure to respect civic freedoms, and for violating the territorial integrity and sovereignty of other states.
We should call on Russia to respect the rights of national minorities and to comply with the international treaties it has signed up to.
I refer to the Charter of the United Nations, the European Convention on Human Rights and the Energy Charter Treaty.
At the same time, however, we should remember that partnership with Russia is a very important issue for the European Union and the whole of Europe.
<D>
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Sartori's excellent work looks like the best legislative outcome for updating and therefore ensuring better regulation of certain aspects of chemical processing.
The report is praiseworthy not only because it satisfies the UN's harmonisation programme; it seems coherent, addressing the needs of producers and consumers, as well as the environment of course, in so far as this is objectively possible.
As usual, some of my fellow Members are not completely satisfied.
I get the impression that this is due to an ideological radicalisation in the face of technological and scientific progress that all too often, on the pretext of environmental protection, tries to coerce us.
Coincidentally, for completely different reasons to those mentioned, countries outside the European Union, not least China, are putting the economy first by allowing chemicals to be manufactured, transported and stored under conditions that are in serious breach of everything that we quite rightly want to protect here.
The Sartori report is a fundamental step forward, harmonising the classification of substances and the labelling and packaging standards of hazardous substances and mixtures.
Doubtless this will help improve safety and prevent risks to the health and safety of consumers and workers and the environment.
It is currently possible for countries to classify the same substance very differently, according to different classification systems in force, and these differences can be so great as to present a risk.
Substances that in Europe are classified as hazardous may, in countries such as China for example, not carry any warnings on their labels.
Not only does this situation create an unfair competitive advantage, but it is a serious threat to consumers everywhere and this, ladies and gentlemen, although you often criticise it, is unfortunately especially true in a global market.
<D>
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Madam President, State Secretary Lobo Antunes has convincingly demonstrated the Council's efforts here.
I have nothing to add to what the Minister has said.
Our Group supports you fully in your efforts to make it clear that the European Union wants to give strong backing not just to a moratorium, but to the aim of banning the death penalty throughout the world.
As the previous speaker has said, the European Parliament has already said twice this year: this Parliament is spearheading the battle to ban the death penalty.
For us as European Social Democrats, the death penalty is the lowest point in human ethics.
I come from a country in which human dignity is the first article of the constitution.
The duty of each and every government regulation is to preserve and protect it.
That is the message of my country's constitution.
On the basis of that message we in the European Union have drawn up a Charter of Fundamental Rights, the prime message of which is as above: human dignity is the foremost guiding principle of the European Union.
Simply put, the death penalty is the opposite of human dignity.
It is the vilification of the human being down to the lowest point of his or her existence.
The duty of each and every morally-driven democrat is to ban it.
We are fighting for this moratorium to be supported by the European Union.
Why, then, is there no consensus in the Council?
There is one Member State in the Council boycotting a joint resolution of the European Union.
I shall not hesitate in naming it publicly here.
It is the Polish government, which does not want us to make this fundamental decision.
It is linking the issue of the death penalty with other issues and saying: when the others link their opinion on this issue with that on abortion and euthanasia, then we too will be prepared to argue against the death penalty.
That is a pretextual argument!
Why?
I'll gladly tell you.
I should like to read a quotation to you, which comes from a radio interview of 28 July this year.
I quote: "I personally was, am and remain an advocate of the death penalty.
A return to this penalty is not possible at present, but I am counting on the fact that a more favourable climate will prevail in the EU in future.”
Lech Kaczyński, President of the Republic of Poland.
That is the reason why there has been no European Council resolution to date on this moratorium.
The Polish President is an advocate of the death penalty and he hopes that there will be a better climate in the European Union for re-introducing it.
I therefore say: this Parliament is there to ensure that the climate in Europe remains against the death penalty.
That is the crucial point.
(Applause)
As long as we as European Socialists have influence, we shall do this.
I would ask the Council one question, however: Mr Lobo Antunes, not of you personally, but of the Heads of State and Government of the other 26 States.
How long will the other 26 Heads of State and Government put up with this and remain silent about the fact that an advocate of the death penalty, who states quite openly that he is so, is able to paralyse the European Council on this issue?
We need an answer to this, too.
(Applause)

Schengen cooperation can take many different forms.
Very many applications can be picked out and closely scrutinised.
I believe that as an MEP, it is worth mentioning, here and now, that one of the basic conditions for the free movement of people is to have a complete Schengen system operating efficiently and built on mutual trust.
Border controls, our common visa policy, cross-border police cooperation and data protection issues are only components of this complete system.
These are different issues, but all connected by one important factor.
Europe's citizens have been given, and are given, every day so much additional freedom, which symbolises for them one of the most obvious successes of the European Union's existence.
As a representative of the electorate in a Member State which joined only a few years ago, I can happily confirm this.
If it was not for the proposal made by the Portuguese EU Presidency, the new Member States could not be part of the Schengen system.
As it is, the latest (second) generation of the Schengen Information System is still not working to date.
It is the responsibility of the Commission and Member States to preserve this freedom, a matter also referred to in two of the questions on the agenda.
The European Parliament also shares this responsibility, which is precisely why it cannot but get involved in issues relating to citizens' freedom.
Consequently, I emphatically support the rapporteur's efforts and agree with his proposals.
<D>
Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, honourable Members, I thank you for your interesting remarks.
I am very happy that I have an opportunity to participate in this discussion because, when the Commission started discussing the proposal to have more transparency concerning the beneficiaries of EU funds, the information was published only in two countries: in Denmark and in Estonia.
Now it is 13, and finally it will be in every country.
This, in terms of Europe's decision-making process, is very fast.
I would like only to say some factual remarks.
First of all, what was mentioned - the disclosure of beneficiaries - will be done in full respect of Community legislation on data protection.
It is already laid down in the proposal.
Several people raised the issue of the publication of information on structural funds, but absolutely the same logic applies to the Structural Funds, to which the same Article 53b of the Financial Regulation applies.
So there is no difference.
All benefits which will be paid out from the European budget will be open, including the salaries of the highest officials and Commission members.
This is totally public.
So there is nothing - and this has been public since the adoption of the staff regulations.
I would like to ask Parliament to endorse the Commission's approach as reflected in its proposal.
We have sympathy for the substance of some of the amendments proposed, and some of these will be mirrored in the implementing legislation or in the final text to be adopted by Council following the Presidency's compromise text.
I am confident that the innovations now on the table will make Regulation 1290/2005 an even more effective instrument than it already is.
<D>
Madam President, I have just returned from Helmand and Kandahar.
I agree that there will be no progress without stability; stability means good governance and it means troops and it means police.
I think that some of our European allies are merely paying lip-service in terms of what they are doing in Afghanistan.
We need more combat forces there; we need greater flexibility; we need greater support for the ISAF mission in Afghanistan.
As far as the police mission is concerned, the EU is doing a good job there, but it is doing nothing in comparison with the scale of the American effort.
There should be proper coordination between what the Europeans and what the Americans are doing in terms of police training.
Finally I should like to condemn the remarks that were made by Mr Brie when he talked about the Taliban and the Americans in the same breath: I think that was disgraceful.
The Taliban are murdering their own people, the Allies are there supporting the local population.
<D>
Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, I am very happy to present to Parliament the report on the action taken by the Commission regarding the effects of the European airspace crisis as a result of the volcanic eruption of Eyjafjallajökull.
The House will know that 84 000 flights have been cancelled, affecting thousands of passengers.
As you know, Eurocontrol, at our initiative, convened a telephone conference on Monday morning and the Commission participated actively yesterday afternoon in an extraordinary Council of Transport Ministers.
There are, in my view, four key messages to convey following the Council.
All the Transport Ministers are in favour of a coordinated European response to the crisis.
National solutions are not effective in dealing with these kinds of problems, which affect airspace globally.
I must underline that the spirit of cooperation amongst the Transport Ministers was high and we have had several telephone conversations where everybody stated they were ready to take responsibility and cooperate.
The second important point is that safety comes first.
There cannot be any compromise on safety.
This is, and remains, our fundamental concern.
We have to ensure the highest safety standards for our citizens.
The third principle is that the Ministers agreed to the progressive and coordinated opening of European airspace while ensuring safety.
This started this morning at 08.00, through Eurocontrol.
Three types of zones are included in this decision, based on the degree of contamination.
The first of these zones is located at the nucleus of the emissions, where total restriction of operations will be maintained, given that it is impossible to guarantee its safety.
The second of the zones is one which will not, in principle, impede air traffic cooperation being carried out, even though ash is still present.
That zone will need to be confirmed, and the decisions on operations will be taken in a coordinated manner by the authorities in the Member States.
The third zone is not affected by ash, resulting in no restrictions of any type on operations.
Eurocontrol is providing maps every six hours with the relevant information for the national authorities.
Fourth, through these measures, we are ultimately anticipating the implementation of the single European sky programme and, in particular, the functions of the network manager.
I know I can count on the strong support of Parliament following the success of the second single European sky package last year.
You will know, and the minister mentioned, that a taskforce - a group of Commissioners - has been organised to discuss State aid issues.
Yesterday, I talked with airline representatives and they said that they are simply not ready yet to assess their losses.
The main question for them, owing to all the economic consequences, is to resume flights.
The model for resuming flights is the most important thing.
We should not panic about State aid and any other measures to help the air transport sector.
Passenger rights is another important issue, and we must enforce the implementation of passenger rights.
The rules are good ones.
Everyone shares the view that the rules are good.
The question is enforcement, which again is in the hands of the Member States.
We should really push ahead with that and have several ideas on how to better enforce the rules.
I would now like to comment on what are, in my view, deliberate attempts to confuse things - who should do what, who has done what and what the models are.
It is clear that in some countries, elections are coming up, and so on, but after the volcanic eruption, all the decisions made were based on existing and agreed models on how to handle these kinds of situation.
This model is intergovernmental and airspace is a national competence.
It is not the Commission which is giving the orders - there are rules covering our national systems and our model, to repeat, is based on existing information and existing assessments.
There is nothing wrong with that model.
We can now think about how to modify the model.
We started discussing this yesterday.
To say that the European model completely failed is totally wrong.
This was, and is, an extraordinary event.
The eruption of such a volcano and the unexpected widespread cloud of ash is something which has happened on very rare occasions in the world - it is not like snow or the like, which occurs often.
It was already clear at the weekend that the situation was turning into something very exceptional, and over the weekend, we had several discussions on how to approach the issue.
To say that the Transport Ministers should have intervened immediately is completely contrary to our understanding of how things are organised in Europe.
Those kinds of decisions are in the hands of independent experts and independent bodies.
Myself and Minister López Garrido were at Eurocontrol on Sunday, and I was in contact with all the Transport Ministers of the larger Member States.
We were ready to take responsibility and ask what we should do to resolve the situation.
However, these cannot be arbitrary decisions, but are in the hands of a special body.
That body held a meeting, and we held discussions with it, on Sunday.
These were very difficult discussions, as what was under consideration were people's lives.
On Monday morning, there was an extraordinary Eurocontrol council, which agreed on the so-called 'free zones' model.
We were very happy that Eurocontrol was cooperative.
To repeat, this was not within the Community's competence at all, but events have shown that a national approach was an obsolete approach.
We definitely have a greater impetus now to create a more European approach to these kinds of events and to regulate them.
We must also, of course, assess the consequences and outcome.
The main thing - as everybody, including the airlines, said - was that it was very important to resume flights.
Concerning passengers, the most important thing is to get people back home or to their destinations.
That was the key issue addressed yesterday.
To sum up, we are working intensively with the Council and with Eurocontrol to monitor the situation and, if necessary, to take new decisions.
The model provided for now is quite suitable for resuming the vast majority of flights.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all, I would like to stress that the Commission has acted in good faith, strictly respecting all relevant legal rules in the process.
We have never been seeking a conflict with the Ombudsman, and even less so with the European Parliament.
Our opinion was that our position would be recognised by the Ombudsman.
Our starting point is that, over the years, the working conditions for agents interprètes de conference (AICs) have been increasingly aligned to the rules of the Staff Regulations.
Since 2000, freelance interpreters have been linked to the Staff Regulations, after the decision of the Council of Ministers that they can pay Community tax instead of national taxes on their income from the European institutions.
And then, from 2004 on, they have been covered by Article 90 of the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants, which is why they are now called AICs.
The age limit of 65 years is a rule of the Staff Regulations that covers all categories of personnel working for the institutions, be they officials, temporary, contract or auxiliary staff, as well as parliamentary assistants, following the recent adoption of a new regulation in this respect.
This rule was applied to AICs by the Commission, as well as Parliament, between 2000 and 2004.
Following a decision of the Court of First Instance in 2004 stating that not to recruit AICs over the age of 65 constitutes discrimination, the institutions suspended the application of the rule.
However, following an appeal against the decision, the Court declared it null and void.
Consequently the Commission returned to its previous practice.
As there is no longer a Court decision in the matter, our reading is that the previous line applies and that the Commission has to apply the rules deriving from the Council regulation of the year 2000 and stop recruiting at the age of 65, exactly as for other staff.
The freedom of the interpretation services of the institutions to recruit AICs according to their needs is a cornerstone of efficient delivery of conference interpretation.
This makes it possible to have most regular and predictable demand covered by staff interpreters, whilst fluctuating demand and peak situations are catered for by recruiting AICs.
This tried and tested system has made it possible for the institutions to satisfy requests for interpretation according to demand, including making a success of the latest enlargements while keeping costs under strict control.
This approach also supports an active policy of training of young conference interpreters.
Finally, I would like to welcome the very positive contacts between Parliament and the Commission in this matter, and I would especially like to thank Vice-President Martínez Martínez for his valuable contacts with my colleague Commissioner Orban in a previous phase.
<D>
(RO) Mr President, dear colleagues, stating that woman's rights are an integral part of human rights could be considered as a tautology because, they would be inherent.
Reality shows that they are only explicitly ignored.
We have recently inventoried the delays in attaining the Millenium Development Goals in which women are a target group but also essential factors for process acceleration.
In Elena Valenciano's excellent report, the Commission and the Council are requested to consider the gender dimension in dialogue with partner countries.
However, in a dialogue there are at least two parties involved and we represent one of them.
We think that the efficiency of the measures to promote and defend woman's rights as well as the control of their implementation also depend on the European parties, institutions and our governments' sensitivity towards gender issues.
It is conditioned by the achievement of their own goals set out in the roadmap for gender equality.
We do not need to invent sophisticated indicators to observe that in the European Union there are governments where there is no woman or others that uncritically defend traditions and practices violating woman's rights.
We all know that the decision to initiate a dialogue on human rights is taken based on several criteria laid down by the Council when certain situations are considered worrying in the partner country.
Even in the optimistic case that all the Council members are supporters of woman's rights, I am wondering what kind of example we set for a country to which one requests measures on representation in political structures.
Unfortunately the remark is valid also for the European Parliament where there is a great reserve that the reform of our own structures include a balanced gender balance.
We request coherence between statements and acts from the European institutions and member states.
It is necessary to preserve coherence between Community policies and instruments so that they do not negatively interfere with the capability measures of women in partner countries.
Talking about women is important but letting them talk is even more important in order to improve the political climate, peace processes and to reduce corruption all over the world.
<D>
Madam President, first of all I welcome the principle of the agreement.
The agreement between the United States and the EU will be, when it is finally negotiated, a major and historic development.
For EU airlines it means more transatlantic flights to the United States.
It is also good from the point of view of airline passengers, with more airlines, more competition and lower air fares.
We have already seen within Europe the positive impact that low fares airlines have on the aviation sector in terms of the huge increase in passenger numbers.
I pay tribute to the EU negotiators for successfully pursuing what are very difficult negotiations.
These are not yet concluded and are taking a lot of patience and diplomacy, but when this eventually happens the net outcome will hopefully have been worth waiting for.
I sincerely hope that the outstanding problems with the agreement can be overcome.
I agree with all the previous speakers with regard to the problems.
We have to dig in to ensure that this is a 50:50 agreement and that, at the end of the day, we fly the flag for Europe in terms of insisting that, whatever they look for, we look for too.
I believe that the restrictions by the United States authorities in relation to demanding personal details for security reasons are most unreasonable.
We have got to ensure in fact that this is not a deterrent to EU passengers going to the United States, because if we do not solve this particular problem it will be a major deterrent.
I am now going to be very parochial and provincial.
I have another problem, which is that the first international transatlantic airport in Ireland was Shannon airport.
It was the gateway to Europe for many a long day, but the mandatory stopover in Shannon will now go, under this agreement.
That will effectively undermine the viability of Shannon airport and have major consequences for the Mid-West region, which is a very disadvantaged region.
However, that is not a matter for Europe but for the Irish Government.
Again, at the end of the day, the EU badly needs an agreement and passengers need an agreement - but not at any price.
<D>
(PL) Mr President, Mrs Malmström, Mrs Wallström, rather than use lofty words - and I have the impression that there is an inflation of lofty words in the European Parliament - it is worth thinking about why the Irish people said 'Yes', when last year they said 'No'.
I think those who are saying it was the crisis which pushed the Irish into the arms of the Lisbon Treaty are greatly simplifying the matter.
It seems that the main reason why the Irish, the citizens of the Green Isle, supported the Treaty, is because of what they secured from the European Union in the meantime.
Ireland has guaranteed itself and all Member States its own, national Commissioner.
Ireland should be thanked for this.
The EU has also guaranteed that it will not meddle with taxes in Ireland, and this thanks to Dublin.
May this prove to be the final relinquishment of German and French plans to standardise taxation in the EU.
Finally, Brussels has promised that it will not meddle with the legislation of the Republic of Ireland in areas of morals and social norms, including protection of the unborn child.
The Irish Government and the Irish nation should be congratulated for their effective negotiating.
By the way, it is amusing to see the rejoicing of those who are pleased with the result of the referendum in Ireland.
In many cases, the very same people opposed the holding of referendums in their own Member States.
<D>
There were many humanitarian crises in 2010: Haiti, Pakistan, and I could go on.
The tragedies that certain populations, often the most disadvantaged ones, experience throughout the world require swift and effective action by international organisations but also by the European Union, which is a major player in the fields of development assistance and crisis management.
Hence, today, Tuesday 18 January, we have adopted Mrs Striffler's report in order to call for increased funding for humanitarian aid.
We should also create a European rapid reaction force for all these crises.
The European Commission is receptive to this idea, and it ought to present a proposal with a view to optimising the existing civil protection system.
Clearly, we will have to use the resources that are already available in the Member States but, at the same time, we also need to coordinate ourselves in a much more effective and much more practical manner.
Slow responses, duplicated aid and inconsistency on the ground are just some of the things that we need to eliminate.
There is great scope for improvement, and the resolution adopted by this House is intended to provide an initial response along these lines.
<D>
Mr President, as chairwoman of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection I would like to congratulate Mr Toubon, particularly on the way he has worked to achieve a consensus among all the groups for a set of recommendations on the review of the internal market, which I trust the Commission will take on board as well as today's debate.
I want to stress some of the proposals which I believe are key in engaging citizens in the progress and development of the internal market and in boosting confidence in particular.
More involvement of national parliaments to better reflect the diverse views of Member States and their citizens is a very important proposal.
Equally important is the inclusion of social and environmental dimensions of the internal market, and of course the internal market needs to continue to deliver more choice, better quality and competitive prices for our consumers and small businesses.
Reducing administrative burdens and boosting innovation, while protecting our intellectual property, will enable us to compete in the global arena.
Consumer confidence in the internal market can only work when citizens are able to see the benefits and enjoy the rights and opportunities they have as members of the EU.
Therefore, I hope that we will go beyond simply protecting our consumers to making sure we have remedies for them when things go wrong.
In that regard, I would like to raise the very important work that is being done by the SOLVIT network and the European consumer centres.
These informal, practical networks provide quick solutions to very complex problems in what is perceived by our citizens as a bureaucratic environment.
One of the reasons why they do not want to shop across the border is because they do not trust that they will have a remedy when something goes wrong.
The Commission should therefore strengthen these networks as an essential element of the review process.
I think, Commissioner, we share the same objectives: to achieve an internal market that is relevant and responsive to all - you said that in your introductory comments - and I think that we want now to work together with you to ensure that our citizens continue to achieve the level of access to the internal market, the benefits and indeed the protection with remedies and redress.
<D>
in writing. - (FI) Mr President, it is an incontrovertible fact that the civilian population in Gaza and southern Israel have been deprived of the right to an existence worthy of human beings.
One news agency told a story of two children who were about to cross the road in Gaza.
They did not look right or left to see if anything was coming - they looked up because they were afraid of what might come down from the sky.
There are clearly two guilty parties when it comes to Gaza's massive humanitarian crisis.
The irresponsible action of Hamas in the Palestinian territories, the cowardly way in which it hides among the civilian population, and the provocation it engenders with its rocket attacks are all indications of the unsustainability of the Palestinian government.
Israel's disproportionate attack on the already frail and desperate Palestinian enclave is another indication of its indifference to international humanitarian obligations.
We must call for an end to this madness in the shape of an immediate and permanent ceasefire.
As a first step, Israel should allow humanitarian aid into Gaza, where an improvement to living conditions would also constitute one of the paths to peace in the long term.
The Middle East Quartet needs to make a move in the right direction, with the new US administration showing the way.
Egypt has a special responsibility, because of matters to do with borders, and its role as mediator with the Union has given us hope.
World history shows that the quest for peace pays off in the end.
We cannot give in, adapt or become accustomed to the notion of an unresolved conflict, because there is no such thing.
According to Nobel Peace Prize Winner Martti Ahtisaari, peace is a matter of will.
The international community may try to encourage and foster this will, but only the parties concerned can produce it, and lasting peace.
Commissioner, could you take this message from Europe: 'People of the Holy Land, show that you want peace.'
<D>
Madam President, I would like to point out a problem with the allocation of speaking time in this debate.
Mrs Herczog pointed out that the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy did not receive any speaking time.
The reason for that is that they tabled their proposals for the budget in another form, rather than actually tabling a formal opinion.
It is not reasonable that this should lead to this committee being punished for choosing a more effective way of working than tabling a formal opinion.
There has also been some confusion between those two parts of the debate - this 2011 debate and the budget review now coming up.
As you may have seen, of the last five speakers in the previous debate, four were S&D speakers.
In the coming debate, we will only have one S&D speaker but I think half a dozen EPP speakers.
There has been some kind of confusion between the secretariat, the President and the political groups.
I do not know who made the mistakes - perhaps we did - but let us just have a look at this for the future so that we can have a more reasonable allocation of speaking time in those debates.
<D>
Mr President, I am not in favour of taking fingerprints from small children or even tiny babies.
Children must be exempted from the requirements to provide biometric fingerprints for passports.
It is therefore right to create an exemption here for children.
There is still no secure knowledge about the use of biometric fingerprints from children under the age of 12.
The main ambiguity is how long fingerprints from growing children are in fact reliable.
If we were simply to use these data, we might achieve the opposite of what we are trying to do, namely less instead of more security.
It is therefore disproportionate to collect and use data whose reliability cannot be guaranteed beyond all doubt.
The compromise which has now been found with the Council reflects these concerns and, thanks to Parliament's insistence and thanks to the excellent work by the rapporteur, it is based on an age limit of 12 for a transitional period of four years, during which time a broad study will be carried out in order to investigate the reliability of children's biometric data.
Unfortunately, the compromise also provides for exemptions for those Member States which already have laws allowing fingerprints to be taken from children under the age of 12.
It is therefore even more important that we expressly establish during the course of the compromise reached that the European legal act on security features and biometric data in passports and travel documents cannot under any circumstances be used as grounds for appeal in order to set up databases containing these data at national level.
<D>
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission, which you, Mrs Vassiliou, are a part of, has announced the publication of its Action Plan on Urban Mobility several times.
The plan was due to be submitted to the Council and Parliament last autumn.
The Commission made this commitment at the conclusion, last March, of the consultation on the Green Paper on Urban Mobility, which was launched in 2007, and again in the 2007 Freight Transport Logistics Action Plan, and in its Communication on a strategy for the internalisation of external costs and transport in 2008.
Time has passed, but the action plan is yet to see the light of day.
As we near the end of the current legislative term, the Committee on Transport and Tourism, which I represent, is concerned that much of the work put in over the last few years may come to nothing.
Can you reassure me, Commissioner, that the action plan is ready?
Can you tell me that it will be made public in the next few weeks, to enable Parliament to finalise its recommendations, as contained in the Rack resolution 'Towards a new culture for urban mobility', passed by this House in July 2008?
Mrs Vassiliou, urban mobility is without doubt an issue affecting the local, and on which local competence will always take precedence over national or Community competence, but that does not mean that it should be tackled without any state or Community intervention whatsoever.
Who if not the European Union can and should define the Community's role in this?
Who can and should interpret the limits imposed by the principle of subsidiarity in this field?
The Commission's - and therefore the EU's - evasion of this subject does nothing to help solve the problem of urban transport and citizens' mobility, nor the problems of air pollution in cities - we know that 40% of CO2 emissions are caused by urban transport and that 70% of other transport pollutants are urban.
Nor does it help the problems of road safety - we know that 50% of fatal accidents take place in cities - nor those relating to the production of consumers, less able citizens, whose mobility is dependent on public transport.
Can we accept that there should be differences between Member States?
Between cities, in standards of protection for the urban environment?
In road safety standards in cities?
In standards of citizens' access to mobility?
Or are they not fundamental rights that the Union should help to guarantee for all Europeans?
Well then, we need to establish standards and uniform minimum objectives, but also best practices and financial incentives.
We need coordination and innovative projects, and to develop and share reliable and comparable statistics.
If the Union takes it on, will this not help in realising those subsidiary solutions that Member States and local communities have every right to be protective of?
Mrs Vassiliou, it may be that you are about to give us a list of good reasons for the delay, and even the failure to present the Action Plan on Urban Mobility.
If you want to try and defend the failure to keep this commitment, before you do so, ask yourself - are these genuine reasons and not banal excuses?
Do not contribute, Mrs Vassiliou, to the idea - which has become popular recently - that the Commission has become so afraid of disturbing the Member States that it has given up on solving Europeans' problems.
It would be a suicidal move for an institution such as the Commission that has not been strengthened by the French Presidency's successful term.
Delivery, delivery, delivery: that is what European citizens want, and for that reason alone they are ready, I believe, or they could be, to look on our institutions with a more friendly eye.
The small example of the urban mobility plan could be a real help in addressing this much larger problem.
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (SK) At present there are many differences in intra-state requirements for construction products and for installing them in buildings.
As construction is one of the sectors where the mutual recognition principle is most often breached, I welcome the proposed regulation on the marketing of construction products.
It is a comprehensive piece of legislation which aims to update a 20 year old directive on construction products and several regulations.
This regulation makes changes to the declaration of conformity requirement, harmonising the legal terminology and defining the exceptions for small and medium-sized enterprises.
According to my information, producers of construction materials are very interested in the CE mark.
Besides this, it should greatly simplify administration for exporters and importers and it has value from a marketing perspective.
Producers of lime, cement and bricks, for example, are already enjoying the benefits of the CE mark.
In the construction sector the CE mark does not indicate safety and the national marks do not have additional value for users.
Instead they represent a barrier to the internal market.
National marks do not indicate that additional properties of a product have been tested, nor do they say anything about the quality of a construction product.
Despite this, producers often have to pay for tests and for the right to label their products with national marks.
I have no objection to voluntary marking which has the purpose of testing the qualitative properties of products, such as ECO Design for example.
I firmly believe that our aim must be to strengthen the CE mark and the obligation to use it.
Commissioner Verheugen, I appreciate your opinion on the use of national marks for construction products, but as shadow rapporteur I support the original proposal of the Commission.
The harmonised standards are a more effective and appropriate instrument for producers on the construction products market and I am therefore proud of having drafted, here in the European Parliament, the framework for financing the European standards.
I would like to thank the rapporteurs Mrs Neris, Mrs Fourtou and Mrs Rühle and their team for their excellent cooperation, as well as my colleagues Den Dover, Malcolm Harbour, Andreas Schwab and Tereza Pinto de Rezende for a great piece of work.
I would also like to express my thanks to colleagues from the Commission and the Czech Presidency for their accommodating and constructive approach.
I wish this legislation much success.
<D>
(SK) Mr President, thank you for giving me the floor.
The report by my fellow Member Mr Papadimoulis mentions dental amalgam as one of the sources of mercury supplies in Europe.
Allow me to quote some interesting figures.
Stomatologists in the European Union use 125 tonnes of mercury each year.
They carry out more than 200 million mercury fillings each year.
Our citizens walk around with more than 1 100 tonnes of mercury in their mouths.
Amalgam waste containing 50% mercury is generated during the processing of dental amalgam and its application, in the process of removing original fillings, during cremation of the deceased.
Extracted teeth and the possible leakage into groundwater after ground burials are also sources of mercury.
Dental mercury also infiltrates the atmosphere during communal waste incineration.
Taking all the above into account, dental practices rank only second or third in the production of mercury waste in the European Union.
I am glad that the report reflects these facts as well.
<D>
India is a country of contrasts.
Its global image has been influenced by overpopulation, poverty (80% of the Indian population live on less than USD 2 a day) and disease.
Recently, progress in the field of economics has helped to turn India into a leading global economy.
However, India's contribution to progress in the fields of medicine, technology and space research is in contrast to the shortages of food and clean water which affect the country.
The EU is India's biggest foreign investor and trade partner.
In 2007, EU investment amounted to 65% of all investment in India.
India's investment in the EU has also risen, many times over, during the last few years.
The EU should focus on ensuring a multilateral trade system, based on certain principles, as set out by the WTO, which offers the best opportunities for fair and honest international trade.
However, we should stress the fact that India needs to combat the large-scale problem of hunger in terms of global hunger indicators, India ranks 66th out of 88 countries.
India, which is a global nuclear power, has not signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, either.
Another worrying issue is the problem of child labour, with children generally having to work in dangerous and unhealthy conditions.
Clauses concerning human rights and democracy should constitute a fundamental part of any free trade agreement signed with India.
We must also ensure that social and environmental agreements and standards are respected.
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (HU) Thank you for the opportunity to speak, Mr President.
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report before us makes no secret of the fact that there are major arguments against conventional forms of energy.
The issue most talked about nowadays in this connection is that of climate change.
Not only do fossil energy sources contribute to global climate change, however; they also make Europe more dependent on external suppliers.
Allow me to cite one example from Hungary to illustrate my point.
In a country where raw materials are in short supply, gas comprises 50% of the energy mix, 80% of this deriving from a single external source, namely Russia.
This results in a degree of dependency that not only has far-reaching social and economic consequences, but can also exert considerable influence on Hungary's international relations.
At the same time, however, these figures and others like them show that conventional energy sources are inevitably going to play a major role in Europe's energy supply in the decades ahead, even if renewable energies gain ground.
To state the contrary would be tantamount to sticking our heads in the sand.
Ladies and gentlemen, the contradiction between the necessity of conventional sources and the risks associated with them must, however, be resolved.
I believe Mr Reul's report presents the necessary toolkit for doing just this.
I agree with the rapporteur that the European Union needs to focus on three fundamental objectives when establishing policy on conventional energy sources: increasing efficiency, and, connected to this, exploiting the potential of research and development, and reducing dependency on external sources.
The best example of this last point is the Nabucco project; construction of this gas pipeline would represent a significant step towards diversification and so it is in the Community's interests to make it happen.
Thank you very much, Mr President.
<D>
in writing. - (NL) Europe and pensions, now that is a sensitive issue.
Various Member States are considering arrangements to shrink their national debts by tying pension funds to their debts.
Mrs Merkel and Mr Sarkozy have already directly mentioned the centralisation of pensions in their plans for a single, centrally-ruled Europe.
I am against any regulation of pensions at a European level.
Pension systems are structured differently in the various Member States.
They are almost incomparable.
In addition, the pension systems in the various individual Member States vary considerably, in terms of size, reliability and supervision.
I do not want to see the robust Dutch pension system suffer because of the chaos in some other Member States.
What I do find sensible, however, is that Member States should share information about their pension systems with each other and that they should make efforts to address specific problems by that means.
I refer here, for example, to university researchers who move to other Member States, whose tax authorities then collect additional levies on the pensions they have built up elsewhere.
An immediate halt should be put to such excesses, but that does not mean that we need to revamp the entire system on a European model.

Mr President, Commissioner, Millennium Development Goal 5 is a very important objective, touching as it does not only on the quality of life, but on life itself, its initiation and continuation.
The importance of Millennium Development Goal 5 is all the greater in as much as its successful implementation does not cost very much in monetary terms.
There are programmes and projects that are already being put into effect around the world that have significantly reduced perinatal mortality, and their cost has not been particularly high.
Despite this, in some regions the achievement dynamics of Goal 5 have been poor or very poor.
Moreover, in some regions, particularly sub-Saharan Africa, there has been no improvement since 2000.
This is a very worrying phenomenon, as it means that implementation of Millennium Development Goal 5 on a global scale is seriously threatened.
Unfortunately in some developed countries we still see a tendency to ideologise the problem and concentrate on one really quite controversial issue, namely that of reproductive rights.
This has already been mentioned today.
However, one of the most important causes of death among mothers is hazardously performed abortions.
However you look at it, it is logical that limiting the number of abortions would bring about a fall in mortality among mothers.
Surely, then, it would be easier to limit the number of abortions than to increase the number of what might be called 'safe' abortions.
It is therefore difficult to agree with the assertion that reproductive health should be a priority in development policy.
It is important, but surely the priority should continue to be the fight against poverty (I agree with the Commissioner), improving the position of women and keeping the promises made by developed countries.
This choice of priorities is very important, because a poor choice of priorities could lead to actions that might be unfavourable.
For example, we include the example of exchanging experience and best practice in resolutions as standard, but if the objective is inappropriate, an exchange of experience and best practice could be ineffective or downright undesirable.
It is also worth remembering that imposing our norms and standards on other countries and societies is morally ambivalent.
In matters of ethics, countries that benefit from our aid should take their own decisions on what is good and acceptable.
We should not, for example, say that abortion is a good solution.
That would be inconsistent and it would be unjustified interference: inconsistent, because we ourselves wish to increase the birth rate in Europe, while promoting its restriction in other countries; unjustified interference, because no-one has authorised us to influence decisions on ethical matters in other states.
In my opinion, therefore, we should concentrate on what is not controversial, especially as there are very many things that are not controversial and on which we are all agreed: education, strengthening the position of women, protecting motherhood, good nutrition, access to skilled medical assistance and obstetric care.
These are areas on which we can jointly concentrate, and thus facilitate the achievement of Millennium Goal 5.
<D>
(HU) I am convinced that the current economic crisis has its roots in over consumption and in the environmental crisis, and that it is in this area that we must seek the solution as well.
We are coming to an important period with regard to climate policy since, at the end of this year, we must reach an agreement in Copenhagen on new common goals for combating global warming.
The task is therefore great, and we must not err or procrastinate.
The legal texts before us not only define the framework and set out the main guidelines, but the real, concrete steps to be taken are yet to come.
In order to reach a 25-40% decrease in greenhouse gases, as the scientists recommend, and in order to halt the decline in biodiversity, we need significant financial resources.
In recent years, I had the pleasure of visiting, with Parliamentary delegations, Bangladesh, China, India and, most recently, Guyana, and my conviction in this regard has become even stronger as a result.
On the one hand, we must support developing countries, but this can be done only through transparent, closely monitored investments and, on the other, the revenues from the European Union's emission trade auctions should also be used to support developing country's measures to promote adaptation.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety recommends a total of EUR 30 billion for this purpose up to 2020.
This is an enormous sum, and to use it properly is a great challenge.
Moreover, the struggle against climate change offers Europe an excellent opportunity to increase new technologies and create new jobs in order to promote energy security.
The UN and the new US administration as well as several European governments have also recognised that in order to emerge from the global crisis, we need not only a fresh, effective energy source but also an engine that runs according to new organisational principles, for the current economic recession is concealing the true problem facing humanity and Europe, namely the environmental crisis.
The green 'New Deal' is an historic opportunity to solve both crises at once.
<D>
(LV) Thank you, Mr Onyszkiewicz, for your very balanced report.
Russia is a very important partner for the European Union.
Joint action can have a positive effect in overcoming the economic and financial crisis.
This must not, however, permit us to depart from our principles and values.
We must demand that Russia restores human rights in Russia, restores freedom of the press, freedom of speech and freedom of association.
We must insist that Russia's programme for supporting Russian compatriots should not be misused as an instrument for reinforcing its political influence in certain EU Member States.
In order for a new agreement to be signed, Russia must fulfil its commitment on Georgia's territorial integrity.
The broad agreement ought to include an energy security strategy, based on ratification of the Energy Charter.
We must also demand an adequate assessment of the effect of the northern gas pipeline on the environment.
Thank you.
<D>
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (SV) Mr President, when one reads the Commission Communication and, in particular, Parliament's report, one might think that the poor little EU is being discriminated against by malign foreign forces.
This emerges especially from paragraph 4 of the report, which says that we urge the Commission to ensure that the European Union's trade interests are defended against the abusive or unfair trade practices of third countries.
And again: 'when third countries unjustifiably restrict access to their markets by European Union companies, the European Union should react rapidly and firmly'.
We should be careful when using that kind of language to former colonies.
They remember when Europe last acted firmly to defend its interests.
That kind of talk can damage us more than any trade restrictions.
Certainly the Commission has a point in that there are technical barriers to trade and unfair rules.
Of course we must discuss them with our partners calmly and reasonably and solve any problems there may be.
But invite, not only businesses, but also voluntary organisations, including those from third countries.
Then perhaps we can understand how the rules came about and understand whether they are reasonable or not.
I am uneasy about the ten-point list.
Restrictive export procedures for raw materials, a ceiling on foreign ownership in the services sector, restrictions on foreign direct investment, state procurement procedures and the application of state aid must be seen as barriers to trade which have their justification; they arise from legitimate legislation and are administrative measures from public authorities.
They cannot be removed without public consultation and deliberation, if stability in those countries is not to be compromised.
Countries must have the right to protect health and the environment and have procurement procedures which ensure that their local businesses are not completely excluded from international competition, thereby creating mass unemployment.
Also we cannot be so unreasonable as to expect countries to protect our intangible property rights when they hardly have the resources to protect human rights.
We should promote freedom rather than set traps.
We must come down on those rules which seek to favour businesses in their countries which have foreign operations and which act against other foreign players.
That is where we can remove rules.
We should be able to turn a blind eye to rules which are directly or indirectly intended to protect the population or businesses active locally.
We ourselves protected our industries until they were strong enough to compete internationally.
Others must be allowed to do the same.
<D>
author. - (DE) Mr President, the military junta in Burma is persisting in its attempts to isolate the country and its people from the rest of the world.
In September 2007, after the Buddhist monks' protests had been brutally crushed, a news embargo was imposed.
Last month, international organisations were prevented from helping the victims of the cyclone.
There was a lengthy delay before aid workers were able to reach the people in distress, and for some the aid came too late.
Now other reports of an equally alarming nature are filtering out, such as the news of the arrests of cyclone victims who had sought help from UN offices.
In addition, security forces shot dead or seriously wounded inmates who were trying to flee from a prison destroyed by Cyclone Nargis.
The EU did not turn a blind eye.
It imposed a trade embargo, although that has not yet had the desired impact.
It threatened to apply tougher sanctions if the human rights situation did not improve.
Yet the Burmese leaders have not moved an inch.
Let us not relax our demands.
The country's political prisoners must be released.
The house arrest in which Aung San Suu Kyi has been living for decades must be lifted.
The courageous commitment shown by that Nobel prize winner would be anathema to any dictator.
The Burmese generals must ultimately be held to account for the way they have dealt with their own country's citizens, many of whom are still missing.
The dialogue with the United Nations' Special Rapporteur and the assurance that he would be allowed to visit the country constitute a first step.
The governments of the Member Countries of ASEAN should also use their influence to bring the junta to its senses.
There is a need to increase pressure on China too, which is probably the only remaining supporter of Burma.
If necessary, the Council and the EU Member States must tighten their sanctions.
Commissioner, we are truly waiting for you to act - the people of Burma need our solidarity.
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (HU) Thank you for the floor.
Mrs Haug's report, for which I would like to express my appreciation and thanks, summarises accurately what the Parliament thinks about the Preliminary Draft Budget.
Listening to the Commissioner's speech, I felt that the rapporteur and the Commissioner dovetail together, and this could fill us with a kind of enthusiasm.
I have one tiny little problem: Mrs Haug's sentences were worded with a critical edge, and the Commissioner expressed intentions of reassurance.
I am delighted by the intentions, but I would also like to see the figures in a format that is consistent with the intentions.
I would now like to highlight two thoughts from this complex material.
The French Presidency, like us, is interested in a strong Europe, but unfortunately right now it has gone away to build it.
A suitable budget is needed for this.
France understands Europe and has done a lot for it.
We hope that there will finally be an end to the lawnmower-style trimming.
The Presidency must be aware that every cent spent on underfunded programmes is a waste of money.
The People's Party wants value to be generated from budgetary expenditure, so it is prepared to act in the interests of greater efficiency, in other words against poorly performing programmes, corruption or expenditure led by internal politics.
The surplus in the agriculture budget is changing due to the impact of global markets.
Many ideas have emerged regarding what we should spend it on.
I oppose all sudden, unjustified decisions, whether for the 2008 budget or for the 2009 budget.
Furthermore, the Union has serious debts in this area.
The twelve new Member States will have to wait ten years before they receive the same support as the old ones.
So competition will be distorted in the single internal market for a decade.
This unfair situation has come about due to a shortage of money.
If it now emerges that there is still money in the agriculture budget, there is a moral obligation to redress this competitive disadvantage.
Directing agriculture money elsewhere is an idea that is also supported by some of the leaders of the new Member States, but nobody should be fooled by the pathological compulsion to comply among the post-Communist leaders; it is no longer from Moscow, but from Brussels that they expect the tap on the shoulder.
Among other things, we must face African problems too, since aid within the framework of the agriculture budget, in the form of seeds and fertilisers, has a serious reality.
Financial assistance can hardly solve a shortfall of products.
My group will support the tripartite amendment on climate change, and will wait with interest to find out what lies behind the surprising fall in the level of payments.
Thank you for your kind attention.
<D>
(PL) Mr President, one of the fundamental problems of the wine market is that more and more wine is being imported from third countries.
We might well ask ourselves whether wine from these countries is better.
The answer is that it is not.
The quality of wine from third countries is no better than that of our wine, but their wine is much cheaper.
My homeland is mainly a wine-consuming country.
My fellow citizens are interested in two criteria, namely price and quality.
The identifying label is less important to them, yet it is common to pay more for the brand than for the quality of the wine.
Promotion alone will not achieve anything.
It will not attract price-conscious customers in the countries of the old Fifteen either.
I have observed that for myself in shops in Brussels.
I very much welcome the fact that the possibility of using the term fruit wine has been retained.
This is a specific segment of the traditional market, and is not in competition with the grape wine market.
As in the case of the definition of vodka, it is not acceptable to act to the detriment of the traditions of particular countries, brands or quality simply because the wine sector is experiencing problems.
<D>
The introduction of the Blue Card, which the EU needs because it is facing a shortage of highly qualified workers in certain sectors, is a step forward for the economic migration of highly qualified workers from third countries.
However, the Blue Card may represent a step backwards if Member States are not going to reject applications for exemptions from this for those sectors of the labour market where access is restricted for workers from the new Member States, based on the transitional measures provided for in the accession treaties.
I feel I need to remind you that the UK and Ireland have already expressed the desire to maintain the labour market restrictions for Romania and Bulgaria for another three years.
I would like to stress that applying the Blue Card directive policy would disadvantage European citizens in relation to those from third countries.
Although this directive refers to the principle of Community preference, it is obvious that this cannot be applied to those European citizens who are subject to restrictions in certain sectors of the European labour market.
Please vote for the amendment on this clarification so that we do not end up in a situation where economic migration from third countries takes precedence over the free movement between states within the EU.
The logical desire of new Member States is not to feel like second-class EU members.
<D>
(PL) Madam President, Commissioner, the planned European Institute of Technology, often said to be the flagship of European innovation, links the three elements of the triangle of knowledge: innovation, research and education.
The key to the success of this undertaking is, in my opinion, good cooperation between academic centres and business environments.
The European Institute of Technology must first and foremost be in a position to accumulate large amounts of private funding.
Today I want to draw the European Parliament's attention to the preparations being made for Wrocław to become the headquarters of the Institute, or else one of the centres of its Knowledge and Innovation Communities.
Wrocław may be a symbol of European history; it is often called the Strasbourg of Central and Eastern Europe.
There are currently more than 140 000 students studying in Wrocław; the city is one of Poland's main research centres.
It has given birth to the EIT+ Centre for Innovation and Technology, which is lobbying to have the Institute located in Wrocław.
One final comment.
In the last ten years, Wrocław has become a city of modern financial services, a place that draws in capital from all over the world, a symbol of European creative energy and development, and a positive symbol of globalisation.

(PL) Madam President, in 2001 the Vice-President of the Beijing Organising Committee for the Games of the XXIX Olympiad, Liu Jingmin, stated that awarding the Olympic Games to Beijing would help to promote the development of human rights.
In recent months, however, the Chinese authorities have been allowing themselves to violate freedom of expression more frequently than usual.
They have also repressed journalists and activists.
The arrest of Hu Jia, a leading human rights activist who was nominated for the Sakharov Prize in 2007 sent shock waves through society.
Hu Jia was arrested on the pretext that he had been inciting others to overthrow the national government.
He is still being denied the right to a lawyer and to medical care.
China must be forced to comply with international standards in human rights and to respect those rights.
It must also put an end to exploitation of the Games as an excuse for the illegal detention of journalists and dissidents.
We should remind the Chinese authorities of the idea inspiring the Olympic movement, namely linking sport with a vision of a peaceful society and the preservation of human dignity.
At the same time we should call for the immediate release of Hu Jia and of all the other activists detained without trial, so that they can return to their families and access essential medical care.

Member of the Commission. - The Helsinki European Council of December 1999 granted Turkey the status of candidate country and accession negotiations with Turkey were opened in October 2005.
The Commission has reported regularly to the Council and Parliament on Turkish progress towards meeting the Copenhagen criteria.
On 9 November, the Commission published the 2010 progress report on Turkey.
The report covers the period from early October 2009 to October 2010 and progress is measured on the basis of decisions taken, legislation adopted and measures implemented.
Turkey has pursued its political reform process, in particular, through the reform of its constitution, and continues to sufficiently fulfil the political criteria.
The constitutional amendments adopted by referendum on 12 September created the conditions for progress in a number of areas such as the judiciary, fundamental rights and public administration.
The implementation of the constitutional changes in a transparent and inclusive way is essential for Turkish progress.
The democratic opening aimed notably at addressing the Kurdish issue has not yet met expectations.
The decision of the constitutional court to close down the Democratic Society Party and a surge in PKK terrorist attacks also undermined this policy.
Significant reforms are still required on fundamental rights, in particular, in the area of freedom of expression.
The high number of legal suits against journalists and undue pressure on the media undermine freedom of the press in practice.
With regard to regional issues and international obligations, it is now urgent that Turkey fulfils its obligation of full non-discriminatory implementation of additional protocols to the association agreement.
The Commission has recommended that, if there is no progress on this issue, the measures adopted by the European Union in 2006 should be upheld.
This will affect the overall progress of the negotiations.
Turkey has continued to express public support for the negotiations under the auspices of the United Nations between the leaders of the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities to reach a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem.
However, there has been no progress towards normalisation of bilateral relations with the Republic of Cyprus.
As regards the economic criteria for accession to the European Union, Turkey continues to be a functioning market economy that can cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union.
Turkey has witnessed strong economic growth in 2010, recouping the losses incurred during the financial crisis, but the process of privatisation and structural reform needs to continue.
Turkey continued improving its ability to take on the obligations of membership by aligning its laws and regulations with those of the European Union.
Two negotiating chapters were opened during this reporting period - environment and food safety - adding to a total of 13 chapters that are currently open.
Important progress has been made on energy security with the ratification of the intergovernmental agreement on Nabucco, and on cooperation in the aviation sector with initialisation of the EU-Turkey horizontal aviation agreement.
Much alignment remains to be done, particularly on fisheries, social policies, justice and home affairs, and the customs union where longstanding trade issues remain unresolved.
It remains crucial that Turkey improves its administrative capacity to implement and enforce EU-related legislation.
<D>
(PL) The Fava report and the report by Mr Marty for the Council of Europe share a common feature: they are devoid of all evidence.
They amount to a series of vague irrelevant reflections by the rapporteurs on the rendition of terrorist suspects and the supposed secret CIA centres in Europe.
The Fava report has been discussed on a number of occasions and it would be a pity to waste time on further debate.
I should, however, like to offer my sincere congratulations to Mr Marty.
From the very beginning he set out to make his name known and he has certainly been successful in that regard.
Both his reports are of a lamentable standard, and cast him into ridicule as a lawyer.
Mr Marty obviously came to the conclusion that it was worth paying such a price in order to make his name known in political circles.
Inter alia he did not allow individuals who had come forward voluntarily to be heard, including the Members of the European Parliament he slandered in the report but could not spare time for.
Mr Marty failed to respond to repeated invitations from the Polish authorities.
He was unable to offer an explanation for such behaviour when he appeared before Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs.
Mr Marty has serious difficulty distinguishing between facts and speculation.
I can appreciate that to do so would endanger the tactical approach and strategic target he set himself from the outset, namely political self-aggrandisement.
It is unfortunate that he exploited the good name of the Council of Europe to achieve his ambition.
<D>
President-in-Office of the Council. - (SL) It is my great pleasure to present preparations for the twenty-first EU-Russia summit which will take place at the end of this month, on 26 and 27 June, in the Western Siberian town of Khanty-Mansiisk.
The Presidency believes that the upcoming Summit is the right opportunity for both sides to open a new chapter in mutual relations.
In particular, we should be ready to make use of the potential positive momentum that the recent election of the Russian President Medvedjev could bring to EU-Russia relations.
The main objective for the Summit is obviously to launch negotiations on the new framework Agreement with Russia.
We are very pleased that the Council of 26 May adopted the EU negotiating mandate for the new Agreement.
In recent months the Presidency, together with the Commission, has invested a lot of effort at the highest level in trying to overcome the remaining obstacles on the EU side.
By negotiating a new Agreement, the EU will endeavour to further deepen its cooperation with Russia in areas of common interest, while addressing more effectively the topics where our positions may differ.
As usual, the Summit will provide an opportunity to take stock of progress in implementing the four Common Spaces.
Allow me to briefly highlight their major characteristics.
As for the first common space, which is Economic space, the Summit will push for the early warning mechanism in the field of energy, as we want to take full advantage of all the options it offers.
We will restate the prime importance of predictable and stable rules for foreign investments in Russia.
In addition, the EU also intends to reiterate that formal negotiations on a deep and comprehensive Free Trade Agreement can start as soon as Russia has completed its WTO accession process.
As regards the long-standing problem of Siberian overflight fees, the EU will continue to press for signature of the existing agreement.
In the second common space, which is Freedom, Security and Justice, the EU intends to voice concern about the situation concerning human rights, democracy and the rule of law in Russia, particularly in the context of the recent elections.
I should add that this concern is shared by both the Presidency and the European Parliament.
The Summit will also provide an opportunity to assess progress with the implementation of visa facilitation and readmission agreements.
Under the third common space, which is External Security, the EU will underline that more concrete actions for further cooperation in the Common Neighbourhood are needed.
Above all, we will try to emphasize that Russia must endeavour to find a solution to the conflict in the Transnistrian region and Georgia.
At the same time, we should welcome Russia's participation in the EUFOR Chad operation, and agree on further cooperation within the framework of the European Security and Defence Policy.
As for the fourth common space, which is Research, Education and Culture, the Summit should welcome the first Permanent Partnership Council on Research, which took place in Slovenia in May.
Finally, the Summit will provide an opportunity to address international issues, such as frozen conflicts, the Middle East, Iran, Afghanistan and others.
Ladies and gentlemen, permit me to conclude with the following: The summit will place particular emphasis on the endeavours of both sides to ensure the stable and democratic development of countries in the common neighbourhood area.
Concrete cooperation between the EU and Russia within the framework of the common neighbourhood is essential to addressing problems of mutual interest and concern, and in particular frozen conflicts.
With this I shall end and I shall listen to your debate with interest.
(Applause)
<D>
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I want to give my views on two of the priority points, namely our rapporteur's criticism that EU budgeting lacks transparency, and the Commission's staff policy.
As rapporteur on the budget I am asking the Commission to address the point of budgetary transparency and to put forward proposals for the next planned reform of the budgetary system.
The information contained in the actual budget is absolutely inadequate and these lists of numbers are actually no use to us at all.
So far the Commission has been producing a lot of accompanying documents, which only devalues the budget itself.
Why not include more information within the budget itself from the outset, which would remove the need for some of the reports that have been requested and please both the Commission and Parliament.
I will work on those foundations for the next budgetary reform and would ask my fellow Members, even at this stage, to support the preliminary activities, because I would like to have several studies carried out on the subject.
My second point is this: in its December resolution on the 2007 budget, Parliament called for a progress report on staff screening, wanting it by 30 April 2008.
I assume we will receive that report in a few days' time.
This screening that Parliament called for has now turned into one of the Barroso Commission's major success stories.
The President of the Commission is setting himself up as a reformer, but he can only continue to be taken as a reformer if he draws conclusions from the screening before the end of this Commission's term.
That means he must undertake a critical review of decentralisation and take the first steps in that direction.
He owes that not only to the taxpayer and to Parliament but also to his staff, which is currently wasting its time and skills on far too much in-house administration and bureaucracy.
The Commission also owes it to itself, as given the challenges facing the EU and the important management tasks it is undertaking, we believe that - also in view of the 2009 budget, which as you know does not provide for any new items - it can succeed with those tasks only if it also embarks on the appropriate measures and changes within the administration.
<D>
- (ES) Mr President, with a budget that represents 0.99% of the Union's GDP we cannot have a solid political position.
With regard to category 1a, competitiveness for growth and employment, it should be pointed out that this is the first time that the figures on these policies represent the majority of the preliminary draft budget.
However, the Council's figures cut down these categories relating to the Lisbon Strategy, which should be at the core of the Union's policies.
I would like to mention the financing of Galileo and the European Institute of Technology, which are priority projects for our competitiveness and credibility.
The financial perspective 2007-2013 are insufficient to finance projects of such strategic importance.
Another point relates to the Frontex Agency, which plays an essential role, both from a humanitarian point of view and from a political point of view.
The European Council in June reiterated the need to strengthen Frontex in order to improve the Union's capacity to manage its external borders.
This is also one of the priorities that have been expressed on several occasions by Parliament.
Proof of this is the proposed increase of EUR 30 million in commitment appropriations for the Agency's operational costs, which is an increase of 127% on the preliminary draft budget.
The allocation to category 4 is clearly insufficient for achieving our objectives and fulfilling our promises as a global player and, in particular, as has already been said here, in the operations in Kosovo and Palestine.
Finally, I would like to say that the confirmation of the Union's participation in EXPO Zaragoza 2008 - Water and Sustainable Development - is the right decision and is a good opportunity to bring European policies closer to the citizens of Europe, which we need to do.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - I fully and gladly recognise the value of your suggestions and your input.
Opening up a little more the scope of my answer, I would like to say that we are at the stage of completion of the internal market, which really is a foundation of the Union.
However, so far the market has been very much oriented to business and to having the right conditions for business, and quite rightly so.
Now, though, we need to complete the internal market with a second stage in which consumers feel everywhere equally welcome and equally well protected.
That is the consumer policy for the 21st century.
I am very glad to report back to you that, in the Consumer Strategy 2007-2015, education aimed at empowering consumers is the first and very basic pillar of the consumer strategy.
I cannot tell you more now, but we have tools like Europe Diary, which precisely targets teenagers, and we have Dolcetta, which is a complement to teacher education, but we are very much reliant on the efforts of the Member States.
We need to see this policy from the point of view of subsidiarity.
There are countries which are ready to invest more in consumer education and to support the overall Commission efforts.
I have written to all the relevant Ministers asking them for their support, because we are at a really crucial stage as regards having an equally well-performing consumer market all over Europe.
In the future we will talk more about how consumers feel in this internal market.
That is one very basic remark.
Another is that we need to tackle consumer complaints more, and more broadly.
We do not have a common base in the European Commission for consumer complaints.
Like you we receive many complaints, some of which are despatched from Parliament to the Commission, from your constituencies, but what we need to build on is how to deal with those complaints.
The Commission cannot repeat the efforts of an Ombudsman or of a Member State, but if there is a persistent problem in one or other area of consumer policy, we need to tackle it, including with legislation.
There are good examples which show that consumer complaints could really reorient the mainstream of consumer policy.
What we are trying to do now is gather such kinds of information using the consumer market scoreboard.
The first edition of the consumer market scoreboard took place at the beginning of this year.
We have a special indictor: consumer complaints.
We compare the Member States to see how many complaints they are tackling and in what kind of areas.
I eagerly await the information from the Member States for the next edition of consumer market scoreboards at the beginning of next year.
So, step by step, we are heading in the direction of one internal market for citizens.
<D>
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it gives me particular pleasure that we have succeeded in drawing up and adopting a new support programme for European films for the culture and economy of the European Union and worldwide within a short space of time - just six months - and before the end of this legislative period.
This was only possible because there has been exceptionally good cooperation, for which I would like to express my warmest thanks.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The Commission's proposal on the establishment of the MEDIA Mundus programme was an excellent one.
There was excellent cooperation with the Czech Presidency and cooperation in the Committee on Culture and Education was best of all.
Only as a result of this was it possible to achieve this goal in such a short time.
The promotion of European films through the MEDIA programme has been very successful in the European Union for some 15 years.
Ninety per cent of all European films shown outside their country of origin are promoted by the MEDIA programme.
So far, however, the programme has only promoted projects within Europe, and this promotion programme is no longer adequate at a time of globalisation of the markets and new technologies.
There are new opportunities, but also new challenges.
The MEDIA Mundus programme we are discussing today is a fantastic response.
It is a response to the opportunities offered to the European film industry by new markets outside Europe.
It is also a response to the need and the opportunities to use the promotion of films and films themselves to support and drive forward intercultural dialogue.
That is why I should like to express my thanks that the pilot MEDIA Mundus projects were launched.
EUR 7 million were made available.
It became clear that there was huge demand.
Training, marketing and distribution in global networks were supported by the pilot projects and, in particular, the emerging audiovisual markets of the world - India, Brazil, South Korea, Canada - have submitted outstanding projects.
In this regard, with the vote of the Committee on Culture and Education we gladly vote in favour of the proposal.
I should like to ask the entire Parliament for a 'yes' vote to support this programme for the coming years with an appropriate amount of funding to achieve the objective of supporting the promotion of European films as global ambassadors for our cultural values.
This is my last speech in the European Parliament.
I feel very lucky to have been able to complete the programme with your support and should like to pass on my own message.
Where future work is concerned, please remember that cultural goods in Europe should not be simply economic goods but must remain both cultural and economic goods.
I should especially like to thank all my colleagues on the Committee on Culture and Education, in the secretariats, and you, Commissioner, and your Director General at the helm, Gregory Paulger, for ten years of excellent cooperation in the audiovisual field.
Many thanks.
<D>
(FR) Madam President, I first wish to congratulate our rapporteur, Mr Castiglione, for bringing about a considerable shift in the Commission's positions.
We are certainly faced with a paradox here: on the one hand, there has never been so much wine drunk all over the world, and on the other, although in 10-15 years we will be witnessing record progress in wine consumption worldwide, we are told that Europe is overproducing.
Thus I have the feeling that, rather than overproduction, what we have here is a sales problem, mainly down to marketing, and that is why I do not want the reform proposed to us today to be tempted to lower the sector's standards even slightly in order to fall into line with the new wine-producing countries.
We must remember what has happened to European industry.
Today Europe's leading industrial producer is Germany.
Germany has stayed at the top of the class, it has refused to cut down on production and today it is the world's leading exporter, even with the arrival of China and India on the international stage.
We cannot cut back on the quality of our vineyards and their brand image.
We must not, therefore, give in to a crude industrialisation of the wine industry, which in the future would supply us with Heineken wine, Danone wine, Coca-Cola wine and Pepsi-Cola wine.
I do feel, however, that the Commission is tempted to get rid of the smallest and favour the biggest.
That would result in us losing our soul!
I am thus asking you, Commissioner, to ensure that all of the elements that contribute to the quality of wine and can improve that quality - reducing yields, marketing support, careful protection of geographical indications and designations of origin - are preserved, not only within the EU, but also outside it, when it comes to major multilateral negotiations.
I feel this is extremely important: otherwise we will be losing what is undoubtedly one of the most important elements of our agricultural industry, and our European civilisation: wine is a product of culture and civilisation.
This is why we cannot give in to the mirages of the market and industrialisation.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would very much like to thank Ms Hall for a very timely and important report.
We are definitely concentrating our efforts not only on the implementation of current legislation but on actually delivering our agenda of energy efficiency action plans.
I would like to mention that we have also achieved sustainable successes.
This week we launched the Covenant of Mayors, in which more than a hundred cities are now participating.
We have now adopted in the College a renewable energy directive which indirectly strengthens energy efficiency.
We adopted the proposal for CO2 reduction in the non-ETS sector.
We adopted a proposal for emissions from cars.
I could name more very strong measures, where the Commission has delivered.
We have not only delivered on issues of legislation.
Sustainable Energy Week is a good example of how the Commission policy of promoting energy efficiency and renewables is bearing fruit.
I believe that we should strengthen implementation.
The Commission has started launching 59 infringement cases for non-timely implementation.
Today, 42 infringement cases are running.
The Commission will continue to work on this and will also check all the legislation on compliance.
The European Commission is strongly focused on this.
I believe the current legislative proposal on ETS, on non-ETS and on renewables will definitely make the Member States put more emphasis on energy efficiency.
Concerning the energy efficiency action plans, we had rather a lukewarm start.
I wrote to ministers reminding them about their duty to report and to make qualitative plans and now 21 out of the 27 Member States have done so.
We have made a preliminary analysis of energy efficiency action plans, which are part of the package and sometimes a bit overshadowed by the legislative efforts.
I believe that it is right that we continue to do this.
On the issues Ms Hall mentioned, a recasting of the Buildings Directive is in this year's work plan.
We are now in the final stages of defining energy performance in appliances.
We will also change the Labelling Directive.
We are in fact following all the requests that the European Parliament has made of us.
But I believe this directive also offers very good guidelines for the Commission to follow, because it is very concrete.
I could say in some cases things are better and in some cases worse.
I really believe that we are paying attention, but we could pay more attention.
We will definitely deliver.
This report will not stay on the shelf but we will use it as working document.
I will be continually updating Parliament on how we are proceeding in the area of energy efficiency.
<D>
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we need to bear in mind that it is important to improve the conditions and support for information provision and promotion measures for agricultural products, both in the European Union and in third countries, broadening the scope of the proposals that the European Commission has presented.
We therefore support the proposals of the rapporteur and of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, namely those aimed at greater intervention and strengthening the role of trade associations and organisations operating in the sector, in view of their expertise and the important part they also play in ensuring quality control, including the associations and organisations of the Member State that draws up the programme, as well as increasing the percentage of the Community's financial participation.
It is important that there is additional aid, especially for projects selected by the Member States.
Likewise, we believe that promotion and advertising actions in third countries should be able to benefit other important products in addition to olive oil and olives, with emphasis on wines with designations of origin or protected geographical indications.
In this respect, I will also mention here the important role of farmers' associations, with emphasis on cooperative wine cellars and other associations of small and medium-sized farmers, whose existence is fundamental in ensuring the flow of the produce of farmers who, on their own, would not be able to survive.
Once again, I would call for there to be enhanced support for these farmers' organisations to be able to completely fulfil their role in upholding family farming and promoting the high-quality agricultural products they produce, which are essential in guaranteeing a healthy diet for the population of our countries.
We will therefore vote in favour of this report.
<D>
The EU should continue to lead by example in combating climate change.
It is worth noting that the EU has surpassed the goals drawn up in Kyoto.
I believe that the Copenhagen agreement to reduce global carbon emissions should be binding.
In view of this, I have presented an amendment to Parliament's resolution on this matter, requesting an international set of sanctions to be set out in the final text.
I believe that the agreement must be global, ambitious and with a clear timeline.
If we are not ambitious, we will end up with a useless instrument that will be even less effective than the Kyoto Protocol, which already provides for international sanctions.
We hope that there will be effective regulation and that the agreement will include a review clause so that it can be easily updated.
We must also send a clear signal to emerging industries in Asia.
China and India cannot be exempted of all responsibility when they produce a large percentage of global emissions while our industries are going to great lengths to reduce their emissions.
The US has a great responsibility for ensuring the success of this summit.
I hope that the President of the United States, Barack Obama, will show that he deserved the Nobel Peace Prize, because combating climate change will contribute to peace and happiness for all nations!
<D>
It would be difficult to be any clearer.
In its own-initiative report on 'Space and security', the majority of the EP rejected our proposals that:
emphasised that the use of space must serve exclusively non-military purposes, rejecting any direct or indirect military use;
and underlined that Galileo is an exclusively non-military project;
At the same time, it approved, among other dangerous measures:
the necessity of Galileo for autonomous ESDP operations and for the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP);
the development of a common concept for geospatial intelligence policy, creating conditions for involvement of the EUSC in the planning for each ESDP operation requiring space-based observation and space-based intelligence;
that the EU explore the possibility of a financial contribution to the EUSC from the EU budget in order to provide sufficient funds to meet the increasing needs of ESDP operations;
the possibility of funding future European satellite telecommunications systems supporting ESDP operation from the EU budget.
In other words, the militarisation of the Galileo project and the increasing use of the Community budget for military ends.
Hence our vote against.
<D>
- (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, nearly 20 years after the fall of the Iron Curtain, this is the first debate in this House on an issue which could drive a wedge between people in the East and in the West, even in our European Community.
Why?
The view of a totalitarian regime from the outside is very different from the view from the inside.
The way in which 20th century European history was dealt with and retold differed greatly, especially in the individual Member States.
Moreover, in some Central and Eastern European Member States, people who disregarded human rights or sent people to camps or to their death without following the legal procedure are still in office and held in esteem.
It poisons our common future if we fail to acknowledge this properly.
Europe should therefore not remain inactive.
I welcome the fact that we have now given this issue a European platform.
I trust that it will not stop with today's debate and that we and the Commission shall together begin a process to implement the projects which you mentioned.
I hope that we shall manage through this process to bring perpetrators who are still alive to book and to commemorate the victims, in order to develop greater understanding for each other in the interest of a common future.
<D>
in writing. - (PL) We like to say that the European Parliament is the only real forum for airing the views and opinions of EU citizens.
It is therefore a pity that it is only in this House that we are able to convince each other that successive enlargements of the European Union have been an enormous success.
We are all to blame for the fact that not all EU citizens share this opinion.
In turn, this creates misunderstandings about the need to reform the Union.
However, I cannot accept the argument that not having the Lisbon Treaty is the principal cause for slowing down enlargement.
In itself, the Treaty solves nothing.
What is needed is vision and strategy.
The European Union will not be a complete political and geographical creation until it includes all European countries.
It is not true to say that the citizens of countries that want to join the Union expect this to happen immediately or even very soon.
What they do need, however, is a clear signal that there is a place for them.
Without such a declaration, it is difficult to expect them to undertake all the difficult and comprehensive reforms, which involve many sacrifices and hard work.
In particular, we cannot forget about Europeans in the Balkan countries and in eastern Europe.
The European Neighbourhood Policy is a good instrument for regulating cooperation with neighbouring countries in our continent.
However, our EU European neighbours have a right to a clearer and more effective cooperation policy, a policy that does not result in successive hallways and waiting rooms.
If so much energy is being devoted to the creation of a Mediterranean Union, which is particularly being supported by France, then at least the same amount of energy should be directed to the creation of Euronest.
<D>
I will take this opportunity to thank the honourable Members for the recent vote in which the European Parliament clearly showed their support for my 'benchmark' model.
I have been speaking in favour of it for a long time now and was the first to suggest it be applied to emissions trading.
Although the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy narrowly voted against, while the rejection by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety was rather more substantial, life is full of surprises.
Now the benchmark will qualify as a criterion once it has been through the Council.
Moreover, that is all to the good.
The Commission's original proposal and the position adopted by the Committee on the Environment on emissions trading both lacked equilibrium, as they put European production in a position that made it hard to compete in global markets without any special climatic benefit.
This would clearly have meant not just job losses, but an environmental disadvantage, as it would have put pressure on firms to switch production to countries outside the emission limits.
Now the decision has opened the door to a fairer and environmentally more far-sighted approach.
Everything is still open, however, and we will now start to see confirmation of who will reap the benefits of the improvements made.
The environmental targets are unchanging, and they are challenging.
This is not an easy objective for industry, but then it is not supposed to be.
In any case, it is pointless talking about free emission allowances, because the benchmarks - the yardsticks - are ambitious.
So they should be, because otherwise we will not have a system that would persuade companies to join the race for technology that produces the fewest emissions.
The complaint made by the environmental lobby that the package has been watered down frankly seems unreasonable to me, when we consider that targets are being observed and industrial sectors have a declining emissions ceiling.
That is irresponsible talk, but surely not everyone is interested in taking responsibility.
It is enough that the world is being stamped on.
<D>
(EL) Mr President, it is one of life's little ironies that this discussion should take place after the summer's tragic events in southern Europe.
These disasters will unfortunately play a major part in changing the landscape and creating future environmental problems.
Desertification is not a modern problem; it has been with us for decades.
In the past, the gradual deterioration of fertile soil has been a complex process.
It has multiple causes and proceeds at varying rates according to climatic differences.
For example, desertification may intensify an existing general climatic tendency towards greater dryness, or it may initially arise from a change in the local climate.
It is important to stress that the presence of a nearby desert has no bearing on desertification.
Unfortunately, an area undergoing desertification only comes to the public's attention once the process is well under way.
There is often very little information available to indicate the previous state of the ecosystem or the degree of degradation.
We therefore need to be particularly careful about what is to be done with the burnt land in southern Europe: in the near future there is a danger of climate change, which could well cause desertification in the stricken regions.
Scientists also happen to be investigating whether desertification is a permanent factor in the process of global change, and how and when desertification can be stopped or reversed.
This will be one of the topics for discussion at the United Nations International Conference.
More efficient use of existing water resources and control of salinisation are effective tools for areas of dry soil.
There are also ways of using surface water resources such as rainwater.
In addition to science, politics can be considered as a useful tool for combating desertification.
If we are to halt and reverse the degradation of dry and semi-barren soil, we must understand how and why the rate of climate change, population growth and food production affect these environments.
The most effective intervention arises only from the prudent use of the best information.
As a conclusion to this discussion, a resolution on the European Union's aims has been submitted to the United Nations Conference.
Let me emphasise two points which I consider to be very important.
First, it is finally time for the EU to fork out, if it wishes to call itself the 'European Union'; it must assign legally binding funding to actions to combat desertification.
Second, the EU should not rob Peter to pay Paul: it cannot present itself as protector of the environment having failed to promote mandatory general regulations prohibiting the import into the EU of illegal timber that has not been sustainably felled.
Indeed, desertification concerns not only the European Union, but the whole planet.
If, then, the EU wishes to make its presence felt, it must take appropriate steps, and not go to Madrid merely as an observer.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, closer cooperation between national administrations is, of course, right and proper.
I welcome this.
It is even essential.
However, if we all genuinely want to avert a race for the lowest minimum wage in Europe, we need more, and you know that, too, Commissioner.
According to the Rüffert judgment, there is only one solution in my opinion.
We have to improve the Posting of Workers Directive.
The Commission is also required to do this.
We have to draw legislative consequences from this judgment because it reverses the intention of the Posting of Workers Directive.
The freedom to provide services is placed higher than the protection of employees here.
Even the planned change from minimum to maximum protection is explained.
In my country, Germany, 8 out of 16 federal states are directly affected by this judgment.
The regional governments just wanted to serve as models here on wage dumping matters.
Based on the Posting of Workers Directive as well as on the procurement directives, they wanted to ensure compliance with certain social criteria, at least when awarding public contracts.
They have therefore demanded compliance with local standard wage rates as a social criterion, since these are above the minimum wage.
It is difficult for me to understand the decision of the Court of Justice.
If we really want social criteria - and I think we all want this - then it must be possible to achieve even more than a minimum wage.
The judgment should not entrap us into continuing to authorise minimum standards alone in future for posted workers.
This is not the social Europe that my group wants.
To be on the safe side, we also need to examine the procurement directives carefully.
Back in Germany, the judgments of the European Court of Justice on employment addressed this evening have created a back flash in Europe's acceptance.
We are all now being asked to change tack again here.
<D>
Mr President, I, along with most Conservatives, take the view that there is an urgent need for reform of this Parliament.
I have had the great privilege during my life of serving not just here but in the House of Commons and in local authorities in the United Kingdom.
I have to say that in those other bodies - local authorities and the national parliament - there is greater democracy and participation than here in this Parliament.
What we need to see is an engagement of Members of this Parliament in the procedures in the debates.
There is no debate here, there is no argument, there is no fire, there is no enthusiasm, and the problem with this report of Mr Corbett - well intentioned, I am sure - is that it will give the President of this Parliament even greater powers.
That is wrong!
What we should be about, if we are sensible in the years that lie ahead, is giving the Members greater powers and the President reduced powers.
That is the reason why I voted as I did.
<D>
rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, behind this obscure title, each person is assessing the importance of the discussion we are holding this evening following Hungary's request for financing, which was first made to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
The European Union has looked at the issue to verify the conditions under which it could give its support to one of the Member States.
It is true that there was a discussion amongst the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs as to why Hungary first approached the IMF.
That is a question for Hungary as a country, as a member of the European Union of some years standing, and also for the institutions of the European Union in the sense that, manifestly, at this stage, we have been unable sufficiently to develop this climate of confidence, this climate of solidarity, this climate of cooperation to allow a country like Hungary, in its current difficult situation, to consider that its first circle of solidarity, its first circle of cooperation, should be the European Union.
I believe, finally, that the plan implemented for a balance of payments assistance facility, on the basis of Article 119, achieved on the initiative of the Commission and Mr Almunia, whom I thank, will allow an appropriate solution to be found jointly with the IMF.
Evidently, we all think now that, unfortunately, Hungary's situation is not an isolated case, and we must in some way consolidate the cushion which will allow the European Union to meet such requests.
In the resolution that we adopted in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and that I hope will be supported by plenary tomorrow, we ask the Commission to examine how and whether the banks of some Member States of the Union have helped to aggravate this situation.
I believe that this is important information for the European Parliament to have in the coming debate, and which, doubtless, Jacques de Larosière's group will examine thereafter.
We have also said that we think, essentially, that the Council's proposal was to raise the level of the facilities to a given threshold, which we have accepted, believing that this, perhaps, will not be the last discussion we will have with the Commission.
At this stage, we understand that this is the basis for agreement in the negotiations with the Council and, therefore, we accept this situation.
In the future, we hope that the European Commission, Council and Parliament will all regularly approve these amounts, because, in 2002, when the European Parliament voted on the Regulation we are now amending, we asked for a regular update to be organised.
Evidently, and unfortunately, I have to say that we were right.
We are now therefore asking you for it again, Commissioner, and I believe it is reasonable to ask that it be carried out in that manner.
Finally, in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I asked for the tools and processes of Article 100 of the Treaty to enable us to act to support some Member States more widely, and not just on balance of payments problems.
Unfortunately, I was not supported by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in this matter, but I am using my position as rapporteur to urge the Commission to examine this mechanism which the Treaty offers us and which, to date, we have failed fully to exploit.
<D>
(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say very quickly that we deplore all the horrors of Darfur and that we all demand that everything be done to ensure that the associations and NGOs, who have a crucial role to play in these cases, can continue their work and are not expelled.
I would, however, like to put a question to the Commissioner.
I would like to know what you are expecting, what the European Union is expecting, of the African Union.
We have heard one Member demand armed intervention.
In our resolution, we call on the Commission and the Council to intensify the efforts to influence the government via the African Union.
In other countries, we delegate the resolution of conflicts to the African Union.
We are aware of the African Union's position on the al-Bashir case.
It appears that there are double standards here.
What strategy, then, will the Commission adopt in relation to the African Union, as we are talking about the African continent?
Is it the case that here, too, we want to delegate the work and the resolution of this conflict to the African Union?
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to make a statement on behalf of the Commission.
In its preliminary draft amending budget 6/2007, the Commission proposed the creation of a new budget item - 'Damage requests resulting from legal procedures against the Commission's decisions in the field of competition' and the classification of the related expenditure under Heading 1a of the multiannual financial framework as it refers to an operational activity in the competition policy area.
The Commission would charge against this budget item possible budgetary implications stemming from rulings of the Court of Justice or the Court of First Instance in the field of competition.
The need for this budget item derives from recent judgments of the Court of First Instance and from the structure of the budget.
While fines in the field of competition policy are entered as general budget revenue, the amounts to be paid require the creation of a budget item in the expenditure side of the budget, which does not exist at the moment.
The Commission takes note that the budgetary authority does not intend to support the creation of this budget item for the year 2007.
Despite this decision, if necessary the Commission may have to proceed to payments in order to meet legal obligations that might result from the Court's decisions in 2007 within the limits of the current budget and in application of the relevant rules.
It does not prejudge the final decision on the creation of the dedicated budget line and on the classification of the related expenditure within the multiannual financial framework.
<D>
The statistics on Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia are extremely worrying, such as the fact that every year, 1.4 million citizens living in the European Union develop some kind of dementia and a new case is diagnosed every 24 seconds.
Almost one in 20 people over the age of 65 suffers from dementia, while it is estimated that more than 8 million Europeans suffer from diseases of this kind.
In view of that, coordination of the various national policies across Europe is needed.
Fragmented action, the uneven responses that exist in Europe and the prevalence of unequal conditions regarding access and treatment for the disease provide more than sufficient justification for this initiative.
It is based on four key objectives: promoting early diagnosis, improving epidemiological knowledge of the disease, supporting solidarity between Member States, and respecting the rights of people living with the various forms of dementia.
As yet, no cure has been found for Alzheimer's disease.
It is therefore vital to step up extra-pharmacological intervention, promoting interventions that improve the wellbeing of those affected.
In light of all of the above, I am absolutely in favour of better coordination between Member States and a more effective response with a view to preventing dementia.
<D>
Madam President, a partnership between the EU and Central Asia is long overdue, and I congratulate Mr Özdemir on his report.
This vast and strategically vital region is being pulled three ways: by China, by Russia and by Europe.
It is essential that we do all we can to ensure that central Asia's rational choice is partnership with the European Union.
Turkmenistan's gradual emergence from isolation provides the EU with a crucial window of opportunity.
Ensuring regular, reliable supplies of ample Turkmen hydrocarbon resources will diminish Europe's current overdependence on Russia.
This will require a new trans-Caspian pipeline to link up with the Nabucco project.
Uzbekistan, which was rightfully ostracised following the Andijan massacre, has begun to engage in dialogue on human rights with the EU.
This is a considerable step forward.
Clearly there is much progress still to be made before Uzbekistan can be considered a properly democratic country.
However, Uzbekistan is a vital ally in the war on international terrorism, especially with regard to Afghanistan.
For the EU, Kazakhstan should be considered the jewel in the crown of central Asia.
The country's vast oil, gas and mineral resources, including uranium, are an obvious attraction.
Although Kazakhstan is not a western liberal democracy in our tradition, it is making considerable progress as a multi-religious, secular, Muslim-majority country.
Given the fact that only 17 years ago it was a republic of the Soviet Union, Kazakhstan's presidency of the OSCE in 2010 will further consolidate the momentum towards greater political freedom and human rights in that country.
As rapporteur of the eastern dimension of the ENP, I once suggested that Kazakhstan might one day become a member of the ENP.
I believe that something rather like this arrangement, one day, will come to pass.
<D>
(ES) Mr President, tomorrow we will be voting on the second and final part of the third legislative package for liberalisation of the energy market, in other words, the part concerning the gas sector.
This House has always claimed that the reality of the gas market differs from the electricity market, since a sector that controls all its areas of activity from generation to end distribution is not the same as a sector subject to intense geopolitical pressure during the extraction and production phase that controls only transport and end sales.
That is why a large majority of the EP felt, and continues to feel, that we ought to consider another alternative to ownership unbundling for gas.
To this end the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy adopted a compromise amendment to the La Russa report securing a position acceptable to the vast majority of Members, who see this as a credible alternative to ownership unbundling; an alternative that guarantees effective independence of the system operator, since only this can ensure more investment is forthcoming to increase the capacity, and this in turn removes the main barrier to newcomers and provides better and greater competition.
Those of us who support ownership unbundling have always said we could accept a credible alternative that would guarantee the same results.
I think we have succeeded in drawing up a suitable plan with this gas compromise.
However, we are aware that certain people favour the alternative plan proposed by the Council, which does not support the trustee concept and intends to propose a separate vote.
I wish to let it know that without this concept its alternative will not constitute a genuine alternative to ownership unbundling, but rather a legal formula allowing certain Member States to be more equal than others in terms of opening up their markets.
Naturally this possibility does not seem so coherent.
Finally, I wish to lend my wholehearted support to the Paparizov gas regulation report and express my gratitude to Mr Paparizov for his splendid assistance to us during the first reading.
<D>
(LT) The EU-China summit is taking place today in Brussels.
Alongside climate change and trade, topics for discussion include the situation of human rights defenders in China, the death penalty and the Laogai forced labour camps.
These subjects are, without doubt, very important, but I would like to remind you of another acute Chinese problem - Tibet.
It is regrettable that the dialogue between the Dalai Lama's representatives and representatives of the government of the People's Republic of China, which offered some hope, is moving at a very slow pace.
The ninth round of dialogue took place last November.
Meetings take place on an irregular basis and are dominated by an atmosphere of distrust.
This is despite that fact that the Dalai Lama has long since given up the objective not just of Tibetan independence, but also Tibetan sovereignty.
Once again, I would like to call on the leaders of China to resolve the issue of Tibet by means of dialogue, without the use of force and without ignoring the Dalai Lama.
The European Union would undoubtedly welcome such a dialogue and is ready to contribute, to mediate and assist in any way possible.
<D>
The ne bis in idem principle - where the same person cannot be tried twice for the same crime - is a fundamental principle of law within a democracy.
I myself am a victim of a violation of this principle in France, as I am still being prosecuted by order of the government in an affair in which I have, nonetheless, been proved totally innocent by the Court of Cassation.
I owe this in particular to the abuse of authority by Mrs Wallis, the rapporteur on my immunity, who has allowed all the tricks in the book to be used to strip me of the protection to which I am entitled, if the rules of justice, of morality and of the case-law of this Parliament were followed.
However, Mrs Weber's report is not aimed at preventing these ne bis in idem cases.
For that, there is a European convention dating from 2000, which works, it seems, to the satisfaction of practitioners and in compliance with the principles of the rule of law.
No, the Weber report is basically aimed at giving Eurojust, which many would like to see turned into a European public prosecution service, powers to control and to decide on national jurisdictions.
That is why we have voted against.
<D>
(BG) Mr. President, in recent weeks the press has begun to feature comments about the attitude of the European Commission to the various member-states as an example of double standard.
Obviously, every subsequent expansion will encounter an increasingly strict application of the criteria.
Bulgaria and Romania, for example, are subjected to an unprecedented mechanism of cooperation and verification in the field of justice and home affairs.
There is no doubt there are serious problems and the two countries have to maintain a high rate of reform.
But is the approach of the European Commission identical to all?
There are countries where organized crime has penetrated deeply and the consequences are visible: misuse of European funds, backwardness and street crime, xenophobia.
I have not, however, encountered an official comment or motion for respective measures from the Commission.
When speaking of corruption in the corridors of power, I can imagine what the reaction of the Commission would be if a Bulgarian prime minister introduces a law that would save him from prosecution.
Such actions, however, are passed over with silence when it comes to the country of the former Commissioner for Justice and Home Affairs.
I could quote a number of other examples.
I would like to be clear - I am not asking for compromises for Bulgaria or Romania, I am asking for fair and equal treatment of each member-state.
<D>
(PL) Mr President, I congratulate Mr Savary on his treatment of the subject.
Transport is a fundamental problem in urban areas.
These issues, in accordance with the subsidiarity principle, are governed by domestic, and especially local, legislation.
However, the importance of this problem should be recognised, and specific help and coordination should be arranged at the European level.
This concerns both the promotion of good experiences and the propagation of innovative, technical and organisational solutions.
Special support is needed for intelligent transport systems in urban areas, which allow for effective traffic management as well as safety.
Combining the potential of transport, information technology and telecommunications is useful here.
Also needed are modal solutions, which use various means of mass transport and reduce congestion in city centres.
I consider it essential to change urban planning models so that urban transport will be friendly to people and the environment.
I also support the concept of creating a special financial instrument for urban mobility in the next financial perspective.
Let us remember what the rapporteur has emphasised, that almost 80% of the inhabitants of the EU live in urban areas.
They lose a lot of time because of the bad organisation of transport.
Let us not waste that time.
<D>
On 20 February, a unique meteorological phenomenon occurred on Madeira causing, at least, 42 deaths, with 32 people missing, 370 homeless and around 70 injured.
On 27-28 February, in western France on the Atlantic coast (Poitou-Charentes and Pays de la Loire), another phenomenon caused 60 deaths, with 10 people missing and more than 2 000 homeless.
This storm also isolated several regions in Spain, particularly in the Canary Islands and Andalusia.
Besides the human and psychological suffering, these meteorological phenomena caused a scene of widespread destruction with an extremely serious social and economic impact on the economic activities of these regions, as many people lost all they had.
I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution, calling on the Commission to immediately take all action necessary to mobilise the European Union Solidarity Fund (EUSF), in the most urgent and flexible way and to the maximum possible amount to help the victims.
I would emphasise the need to draft a new EUSF regulation based on the Commission's proposal, in order to deal with the problems caused by natural disasters in a more flexible and effective way.
<D>
Madam President, with the backdrop of the global economic and financial crisis and the multi-billion stimulus packages, there is a huge opportunity to increase energy efficiency, to increase energy security from reliable renewable sources and to drive green technology in a green 'new deal'.
In other words, to turn this crisis into an opportunity, and to the benefit of us all in the long term.
I welcome the two alternatives for innovative funding for combating global climate change in the recent Commission communication.
As the original author of the resolution on today's paper, I urge Member States to act on these proposals and also, at next week's summit of Heads of State and Government, to honour the declaration of the summit of 12 December last, which should be put officially on the record, preferably along with the final text of the EU-ETS report, as otherwise it will not appear in the Official Journal.
For this - and I urge the President-in-Office, the Commissioner and Madam President to remember this - we need a tripartite declaration from all three institutions.
This December declaration states: 'The European Council recalls that Member States will determine, in accordance with their respective constitutional and budgetary requirements, the use of revenues generated from the auctioning of allowances in the EU emissions trading system.
It takes note of their willingness to use at least half of this amount for actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, mitigate and adapt to climate change, for measures to avoid deforestation, to develop renewable energies, energy efficiency, as well as other technologies contributing to the transition to a safe and sustainable low-carbon economy, including through capacity-building, technology transfers, research and development.'
It continues.
'In the context of an international agreement on climate change in Copenhagen in 2009, and for those who wish so, part of this amount will be used to enable and finance actions to mitigate and adapt to climate change in developing countries that will have ratified this agreement, in particular in least-developed countries.
Further steps are to be taken at the spring 2009 European Council in this regard'.
I await eagerly an honourable outcome of the declaration from next week's meeting of Heads of State and Government.
<D>
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank our rapporteur, Mrs Buitenweg, for all her work.
This matter was particularly safe in her hands.
Parliament has been calling for this directive for years, which does indeed mean that it is of fundamental importance that it be adopted before the end of this parliamentary term.
At the same time, it is vitally important for the Commission to table a proposal for combating sex discrimination as soon as possible, so as to put a stop, finally, to the existing hierarchy of forms of discrimination.
In other respects, I cannot help but be surprised that, in Amendment 96, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is trying to remove discrimination on the grounds of belief from the scope of the directive.
So, ladies and gentlemen of the PPE-DE Group, do we really need to point out to you that the legal basis on which this proposal for a directive rests - namely Article 13 of the EC Treaty - has been in law since the Amsterdam Treaty entered into force in 1999, 10 years ago?
Do I need to remind you that all of the grounds for discrimination listed in Article 13 are regarded as equal, without distinction?
In addition, ladies and gentlemen of the PPE-DE Group, it cannot have escaped your notice that Article 10 of the EU's Charter of Fundamental Rights treats the religion and beliefs of every single person as equal.
You know, Mr Weber of the CSU, I have certainly heard your arguments, but I really must say that, God knows, they are antediluvian.
Your Amendment 81, rejecting the entire directive, comes with a quite frankly cynical justification attached, namely that the transposition of the directive apparently - and I quote - 'entails excessive bureaucracy'.
You know, Mr Weber, I simply cannot comprehend these attempts to deny people their rights, particularly with this justification, and I hope that your Amendment 81 will be clearly rejected in tomorrow's vote in plenary.
The EU must finally take another step forwards in the fight against discrimination in our society.
<D>
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, EURES has tremendous potential, but much of that potential has yet to be realised.
It still has a number of limitations.
Our question says that the portal should become a one-stop-shop for workers' geographic and occupational mobility, but we should be honest in accepting that it has a long way to go before it could become such a thing.
It should, however, be possible to build such a one-stop-shop in this advanced electronic age.
Workers planning a move across the EU in pursuit of work need access to detailed and localised knowledge to give them the confidence to move with their families - detailed information right down to the level, for example, of schools to be found in a particular locality, the performance of those schools, student numbers and vacancies.
The same applies to healthcare, housing and a host of other issues.
The portal includes information under these headings, but it is of a very general nature and gives only a brief national snapshot.
It might seem like a huge task to build detailed and localised information into the portal, but that is not necessarily the case.
A lot of this detailed information already exists on the websites of local authorities, health authorities, local education authorities and government departments.
Web links to these sites can be embedded in the portal to take users requiring more detailed information to those sites.
Increasingly, information being made available at local level is also held in a range of languages.
In my own area, for example, we have everything from information on how to register to vote to finding accommodation available in Polish and a range of other languages.
Finally, that information is often held in a range of languages of third countries, which ties in with the point addressed by the Commissioner.
Inward migration from third countries cannot solve the difficulties demographic change poses for the EU, but it can help.
I have therefore been pleased to hear what he said about the plans to equip EURES to play an important part in that process.
<D>
(HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, may I first of all point out that it is unacceptable for anyone in this House to proclaim himself or herself to be the sole spokesperson of the people and to speak of everybody else as representing only the opinion of the political elite.
This is an unacceptable attitude.
There are many of us in this Chamber, and there are many citizens in Europe represented by us, who think that a stronger Europe is needed.
In recent times the new Member States have also realised that the problem with Europe is not that it limits our sovereignty or takes away our opportunities, but that it is not sufficiently capable of joint action.
This new treaty, the Lisbon Treaty, will provide the means to do just that.
Of course there are also many of us who are not wholly satisfied with what the Lisbon Treaty entails.
At the same time, we have to say that the time is ripe - after the Lisbon Treaty has been ratified - for an era in which we can put the new Europe, this new structure that the Lisbon Treaty creates, into action.
In other words, we need a stronger Europe and a calm period of consolidation in the years ahead.
I am particularly pleased that the document also expressly prohibits discrimination against individuals belonging to minorities.
In the European Union we talk a great deal about values and about diversity, but European protection of minorities has been on a shaky footing up to now.
This opportunity, and the passage that refers to it, opens up new ways for Europe to translate the rhetoric usually associated with these issues into reality.
After all, we cannot talk of values and common principles if we leave the building blocks of Europe, the minorities and individual ethnic communities, out of the process.
I welcome the treaty and congratulate the rapporteurs.
<D>
in writing. - In light of the current situation in North Africa, and taking into account the fact that human rights are being violated more than ever across the world, the work of the UNHRC needs to be reformed.
The UNHRC has to act in time and to react efficiently to the new challenges.
Regrettably, this is not the reality.
The problem could be partly solved if additional meetings beyond the current sessions would take place.
Further, the UNHRC needs to seriously review its membership to make sure that its members fulfil the minimum criteria.
It is shameful that dictatorships, such as Libya, could so easily take a seat in the body intended to safeguard human rights.
More than ever, the credibility of the UNHRC is being challenged by politically motivated behaviour.
Using the EEA, the EU now has an opportunity to speak with one voice and to function as a global actor.
The Vice-President/High Representative has to make sure that the actions are coherent and that an efficient coordination takes place between the EU Representations in Geneva and New York.
There is no practical alternative to EU value-based foreign policy.
<D>
(FR) Mr President, Mr Wathelet, Mr Barroso, I should like to thank the European Commission and the Belgian Presidency for their open, cooperative and indeed European approach.
In this time of crisis, let us not forget to preserve the future.
Last year, the virtue contest between governments was about who could spend the most.
Everyone was opening the throttle.
This year it is the opposite.
Everyone is now hitting the brakes, Fine.
Parliament accepts the figure imposed on the Council by the most thrifty or miserly Member State, but on condition that we agree on protecting the future.
The Union no longer has the necessary resources to finance its budget.
Instead of being the primary instrument of solidarity between Europeans, the Community budget has become the battleground for contradictory national interests.
The Treaty of Lisbon has been in force for one year now.
It confers on the Union long-awaited new powers.
Yet no additional resource could be allocated to the 2010 budget, and the same goes for 2011.
The same is also true for the Europe 2020 action programme.
At a time when all Member States are committed to policies aimed at massively reducing public expenditure, they have a huge interest in identifying and tapping into potential savings that could be made by pooling some expenses, either between several States or between all 27 Member States.
Europe, the European vision and European benchmarking can help us spend less.
For that reason, the European Parliament is proposing an agreement between our three institutions on a method to work together on all these proposals for the future.
On a personal level, may I add that we will save time by involving national parliaments, as they are sovereign in terms of taxation and budgetary matters.
<D>
rapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a result of the limited time available yesterday, I could not, as I wanted, thank all those who have worked with me.
This has been a difficult directive, and there have been very lengthy discussions, but in my view we have ultimately reached a successful conclusion.
I should like in particular to thank all my colleagues on the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy for their cooperation, especially the shadow rapporteurs, Mr Reul, Mr Swoboda, Mr Manders, Mr Turmes, Mr Seppänen, and obviously Commissioner Piebalgs - I hope I have not left anyone out - as well as Mr Vidal-Quadras for his cooperation.
I should also like to thank the secretariat as a whole, my staff and my fellow workers.
Only three seconds.
This is a directive which is of interest and is extremely important.
It is a directive - please may I speak for three seconds.
It is a directive - we lose so much time in this House! - which is of interest to operators, often, unfortunately, in the form of monopolies, and to consumers.
I believe that in our work, we have tried not to penalise producers or consumers but have tried - and thank you for the applause, but I shall press on - we have tried to work for all European citizens in the sense ...
Right, you are in a hurry, let us conclude very briefly.
This, and I thank you, is a very pleasing expression of parliamentary democracy in Europe.
(Applause)
<D>
I would like to ask you today about the structure of the next Commission.
The portfolio responsibilities that you have presented seem to us to have very presidential overtones.
In our opinion, you are organising this structure in such a way as to give you personally, as Commission President, a great deal of power.
We are surprised that you want to abolish the working groups of the members of the Commission.
In our opinion, these groups have produced good results during the last parliamentary term.
We are also surprised that the responsibilities in some areas have been fragmented in a way which seems to us incomprehensible.
It is a mystery to us how you will handle the division of responsibilities between Mrs Reding and Mrs Malmström.
It seems to us that Mrs Malmström will be creating a sort of homeland security office.
I definitely have nothing against making the climate into a separate responsibility.
However, if you appoint a climate commissioner, you must also show that she has real power and will have access to areas such as energy, industry, transport, the environment and agriculture.
We do not believe that this is the case.
<D>
(CS) I would like to make 10 points regarding the report by Mr Reul.
It is an excellent and well-balanced report, which, in my opinion, is written in the spirit of Antoine de Saint Exupéry's words about our future: our task is not to foresee it, but to enable it.
The report lists practically all the conventional energy sources, except perhaps, to please the Green Members here, for ebonite sticks and fox tails.
Jokes aside, I recognise the exhaustive manner with which the report encompasses the general regulations governing the energy sector.
As Professor Semjonov's historical findings confirm, since prehistoric and ancient times the same basic laws have applied: on the one hand humans have tried to lower the energy intensity of technologies, while on the other hand they have strived to produce more energy.
In my opinion, today an effective combination of energy sources and diversification of gas imports is vital.
The weight of the European single market should be increased as a factor for guaranteeing the stability and reliability of supplies.
There are of course environmental risks involved, which would need to be carefully assessed.
The rapporteur, Mr Reul, refers for example to the Arctic shelves, which, according to some estimates, account for up to 25% of new gas and oil sources.
The Commission will undoubtedly be asked to take measures to reduce the energy intensity per unit of GDP.
Another essential task is drawing up a reasonable technology transfer policy.
(The President cut off the speaker)
<D>
in writing. - (PL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the problem of the implementation of Community legislation by Member States is not a new one.
I daresay it affects the majority of Community policies.
Working out a common position of 27 countries at European level is in fact only the beginning of a laborious process of harmonisation and implementation of the principles adopted.
It is high time the Member States took responsibility for this process themselves.
The effectiveness of our joint endeavours at European level depends to a large extent on commitment and the implementation of recommendations by the national administrations of the Member States.
What is needed is cooperation between the different levels of our public administration.
I can safely say that, as Members of the European Parliament elected directly by the peoples of the individual Member States, we are ready for and open to every form of cooperation with our national and regional administrations that can improve and speed up the implementation of Community legislation.
We cannot allow matters like the strengthening of economic and social cohesion, which is one of the basic principles of the Treaties, to be marginalised - as is happening with the problem submitted to us today.
A proper EU regulation on territorial cooperation groupings has existed since July 2006, but to this day it is impossible to take advantage of it owing to the absence of corresponding legislation by Member States.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, in a globalised world, where tax evaders and fraudsters take advantage of the limited scope of authority of national tax administrations, efficient cooperation and mutual assistance between tax administrations is essential to better combat tax fraud and evasion.
Improved rules and greater transparency are crucial.
This has recently been underlined by the G20 summit in London, and it is even more relevant in the internal market in the midst of the financial crisis and the need to tighten fiscal policies in the European Union.
Against this background I am glad to discuss with you tonight two proposals that both contribute to the objective of fighting tax fraud and tax evasion in two different tax areas.
The proposed revision of the Savings Tax Directive seeks to close loopholes and better prevent tax evasion.
I very much welcome the constructive and supporting attitude to this proposal shown in the report by Mr Hamon and the opinion by Mrs Siitonen.
I am aware that the most controversial point of the discussions in the committees has been Amendment 20, fixing an end to the transitional period during which three Member States are allowed to levy a withholding tax in place of automatically exchanging information.
I also notice the opposed initiative from Mrs Lulling and Mr Karas supporting, through Amendment 28, the option for these three Member States to pursue the levying of the withholding tax and to abstain from automatic information exchange on a permanent basis.
Let me recall that the ultimate objective of the Savings Tax Directive is automatic exchange of information on as wide a basis as possible, as this is the only reasonable tool to enable the country of residence of the taxpayer to apply its own tax rules to cross-border income from savings.
This is perfectly in line with recent developments at international level - such as the G20 conclusions - favouring transparency and the strengthening of the cooperation between tax administrations on the basis of exchange of information.
Therefore I can assure you that the Commission, while rejecting Amendment 28 because it contradicts the aim of the Directive, has no negative view on Amendment 20.
However, we consider that fixing a date for the end of the transitional period is premature at this stage and could create an obstacle to the necessary quick adoption of the amending proposal by the Council.
There is actually a need to evaluate when and how the political commitments for enhanced cooperation, which have been taken by a number of jurisdictions, can actually be implemented.
Nevertheless, the Commission will not be opposed to any reinforcement of the corresponding provisions of the Directive which could be unanimously agreed by the Council.
In Amendment 22 the Commission is asked to produce by the end of 2010 a comparative study analysing advantages and weaknesses of both the systems of exchange of information and of the withholding tax.
However, the target date for the production of this study does not seem realistic: all Member States would also have to make available to the Commission, from this year onwards, the elements of statistics the transmission of which is set to be optional for them under the Council conclusions of May 2008 and Annex V of the amending proposal.
Concerning the other amendments of a more technical nature which aim either at extending the scope of a particular provision - like Amendment 17 on insurance - or at limiting the administrative burden on the economic operators, the Commission considers that its proposal is already the result of a delicate balance between improving the effectiveness of the Directive and limiting an additional administrative burden.
The proposed amendments, however, could negatively affect this delicate balance.
They could either increase the administrative burden in a disproportionate manner - this is notably the case for the amendments aimed at extending the scope - or have an unfavourable impact on the effectiveness of the provisions.
While appreciating the constructive approach of Parliament, the Commission cannot therefore accept some of the amendments in their present form.
However, the Commission will defend the spirit of a number of these amendments in the Council deliberations without formally amending its proposal.
Turning now to the sensitive subject of VAT fraud, I would like to recall that at the ECOFIN meeting of 4 December 2007 the Council invited the Commission to accelerate its work on the conventional measures to combat VAT fraud.
The ECOFIN also invited the Commission to present legislative proposals to rectify the shortcomings encountered in the current legislation.
Hereupon the Commission presented a communication on a coordinated strategy to improve the fight against VAT fraud in the European Union in December 2008.
The communication sets out a series of measures for which the Commission intends to present legislative proposals in the short term.
The present proposal is part of the first set of proposals announced in this communication.
The proposal will allow the Member States to better fight VAT fraud in two ways.
Firstly, by providing further clarification on the conditions for exempting certain imports of goods, and, secondly, by creating the legal basis for allowing cross-border joint and several liability for traders failing to fulfil their reporting obligations.
I would like to thank Parliament, and in particular the rapporteur, Mr Visser, for dealing with this proposal in such a short time and for the constructive report.
Allow me, however, some comments.
Amendments 2 and 4 of the report would require the Commission to carry out an evaluation on the functioning of the new cross-border joint and several liability provision.
Unfortunately, the Commission does not possess this information, as the assessing of taxes, as well as their recovery, are purely national competences.
Furthermore, if the Commission receives complaints from the economic operators that the provision is being misused by national tax administrations or leads to unwarranted results, it will assume its responsibility as guardian of Community legislation and take appropriate measures.
This includes in particular presenting a proposal to amend this provision when necessary.
Amendments 3 and 5 go against the division of competences between Member States in the overall functioning of the Community VAT system.
This system is based on a taxable event taking place in a specific Member State, leading to a VAT debt and VAT liability in that Member State.
It is the Member State where that VAT is due that will determine the procedure to be followed in order to collect this VAT, including from non-established traders.
Therefore, a trader who has not fulfilled his reporting obligations in the Member State of departure will have to justify his shortcomings to the tax administration of the Member State where the VAT is due and not to the tax administration of his own Member State.
The latter will only intervene upon request of the first Member State in order to obtain additional information or in the tax recovery process.
<D>
in writing. - (NL) Mr President, if we mean well toward small and medium-sized enterprises, we have to pass laws that they are also able to comply with.
That also applies to the hygiene regulations for the food sector.
Last year the Commission presented a proposal to amend the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 to bring them more into line with what is achievable for the smallest enterprises.
The amendments proposed by the Commission are very useful because they still require small companies to meet hygiene standards but at the same time they relieve them of red tape and of the obligations that are genuinely not feasible for small businesses.
On the one hand, it is unfortunate that Parliament has not completely followed the Commission.
On the other hand, I voted for the final report because we have been able to make some progress towards a solution.
I still regret the fact that the responsibility is being shifted on to the Member States.
Member States will now have to take up their responsibility and allow their small and medium-sized enterprises to depart from the strict HACCP requirements.
<D>
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, let me begin by congratulating Mr Schwab on his report and thanking him for his extremely cooperative approach to this whole matter.
Last Thursday night, a colleague of ours, Linda McAvan, was involved in a very serious car accident.
Her car was destroyed, but she walked away relatively unhurt.
This was because the car she was driving had the most modern safety features and this enabled her not to be seriously injured.
That is the context in which we are discussing this report.
Road safety saves lives, as Commissioner Verheugen commented, and is so important to the well-being of many families in the European Union.
We should not lose sight of that, even in these very difficult times.
That is why I was determined to oppose those people in this Parliament and in the Council who wanted to weaken this Commission proposal.
I believe the original Commission proposal is a very good one, and we were determined to resist changes to it.
There was one main weakness, however, in that proposal, which is that there was no provision for the selling off of tyres that did not meet the new requirements after the implementation date.
I believe that to be a major flaw.
That is why I proposed to the committee - and the committee accepted - an amendment stating that tyres that did not meet the standards after the implementation date should be sold off after 12 months.
However, in the current circumstances of the car industry, given that cars are not being sold, it was quite clear in the discussions we had with the Council that, in fact, 12 months was probably unrealistic, and we had to consider the serious environmental consequences of getting rid of tyres that are perfectly good and sound.
Therefore, we were prepared to accept, in the trialogue, 30 months after the implementation date as being the period before which tyres not meeting the requirements should be sold off.
However, thanks to the intervention of Mr Schwab, if the Commission believes that there could be an earlier date, that is provided for in the comitology procedure.
This was an important area of strengthening.
I would also draw attention to the important environmental measures - particularly tyre pressure monitoring systems - which will not only save on CO2 but also make cars safer, because under-inflated tyres are a cause of many accidents.
We have reduced rolling resistance and included gear shift indicators in this proposal, which was not in the original proposal.
This will not only benefit the environment but also save motorists money - it is cash in people's pockets, which is very important at this time.
The point about safety has been well made.
As I say, tyre pressure monitoring systems are very important, because under-inflated tyres - much to my shame, the United Kingdom is one of the worst culprits for having under-inflated tyres - are a cause of accidents.
Lane departure warning systems and electronic stability control are also important.
I congratulate Mr Schwab on bringing the implementation of these forward by a year, because they will be of major advantage in terms of safety.
As Mr Harbour and the Commissioner have pointed out, simplification is part of this proposal and that is very important.
Finally, I would draw attention to what we have done in terms of demanding greater emphasis, in road services, on reducing noise.
This is because road traffic noise is a cause of stress, and stress is a cause of ill health and, indeed, of fatalities, and it is therefore important to address that issue.
<D>
(RO) According to the European Commission's report in October 2008 on implementing the Barcelona objectives and the care framework for pre-school children, Member States have not met the objectives set by European Union leaders.
In this case, I recommend the following actions:
1. increase the involvement of national governments in this problem,
2. create at national government level a team of specialists which deals exclusively with this problem,
3. develop EU control over Member State governments through a set of specific instruments.
All these measures would help ensure equal opportunities between women and men, improve the quality of life, and also compensate for an ageing population as they would boost the birth rate.
<D>
- Madam President, I should like to thank Mr Lagendijk, whose great political skills have produced a wonderful resolution for us to work from.
I thank him particularly for accepting paragraph 26, to which I wish to draw the Minister's and the Commission's attention.
Here we note the exceptional ill-health of 1 500 Roma people, who are sitting on the edge of a lead mine and have been there through UN misjudgement for nine years.
I fully accept that, as Minister Vondra has said, this is perhaps not quite the mission of the European Union.
Nonetheless, I thank the Commission team for picking up this topic immediately I raised it and for visiting and for seeing the damage that the lead levels have caused.
These people have monstrous lead levels in their blood, irreversible damage, and need immediate and urgent relocation and medical treatment.
Minister Vondra, you promised that you would keep this Parliament fully briefed.
May I ask you, as President-in-Office, to give this matter your profoundest attention and to tell me what you do.
<D>
in writing. - (PT) As we have highlighted throughout this process, the aim is to amalgamate and deliberately confuse 'competition' with 'transparency'.
Obviously it is necessary to determine the relevant criteria for airport charges and what these charges actually represent.
However, this should not occur within a policy aimed at liberalising and privatising a strategic public service such as air transport, particularly by creating a 'truly competitive airport market', applying the 'user pays' principle and requiring profitability in a public service.
Indeed, as we have previously highlighted, the aim even seems to be to remove the 'supervisory role' from public control, by transferring this to 'independent' supervisory authorities or bodies.
We would reiterate that previous privatisation in this sector has not resulted in added value in the services provided, but has helped to destroy jobs and reduce workers' rights and, in some cases, caused technical and operational problems.
Despite the outermost regions not having been explicitly excluded from the scope of the directive (by recognising the permanent natural and geographical disadvantages and constraints affecting these regions and by establishing adequate derogations from compliance with universal public service obligations), as we proposed, we welcome the fact that the directive's scope has been limited to airports with more than 5 million passengers per year.
<D>
in writing. - (PT) Almost 50% of the population of the European Union lives in coastal regions, and this fact alone demands redoubled attention to the integrated preservation and management of these regions.
In view of this, it is crucial that Integrated Coastal Zone Management is ensured within the EU, as recommended by the European Commission in a statement published on this matter.
It is also important to point out that 80% of the rubbish and pollution in the sea originates from the land, which is why there needs to be a concerted strategy which also involves combating this problem on the land.
Apart from environmental issues, oceanic pollution and European coastal degradation present an economic problem.
This is because in certain countries, such as Portugal, the practice of tourism which is aimed at maritime activities like whale watching, diving and others, constitutes a significant source of income for some regions, including the Azores, Madeira and the Algarve.
Like what is happening with overfishing, the pollution of the waters has also contributed substantially to the current state of depletion in certain stocks of species that are important fishery resources.
Therefore, the Marine Strategy Directive, an environmental pillar of the strategy for integrated maritime policy, needs to be implemented in full.
Oceans and coastal zones must be a strategic priority for Europe, and for this reason, I wholly support this report by Parliament.
<D>
in writing. - The Plan of Action was targeting 20 % efficiency by 2020 is an ambitious plan but a necessary one.
On the other hand, it is useless to set targets if there isn't a will to achieve them.
For instance, out of a total of 21 actions scheduled for completion by 2007 only three were completely finalised.
This is a dismal record.
It is true that many others are in progress but nonetheless a percentage which is less than 15 % of completed projects is not something to be proud of.
I am ashamed to say that in me country, Malta, the issue has not been tackled seriously.
In an island where the sun and wind exist in abundance one would have expected that full use would be made of these two elements.
Regarding solar energy very few private, commercial and public buildings make use of this alternative energy.
Wind energy was more popular in the past in agricultural areas.
The Government is intent on setting up offshore wind farms notwithstanding that the technology is not available for the depths of Maltese waters.
Not only but it has made it known to a major developer, who waited to set up four wind mills generating energy, that the permission would not be given because of aesthetic reasons.
<D>
The Directive concerning unfair commercial practices and the Directive concerning misleading and comparative advertising have immense significance in terms of giving consumers more confidence and ensuring legal certainty for businesses in the internal market.
This has particular significance in relation to cross-border transactions, which are increasingly common in the European market.
National consumer protection authorities are still encountering difficulties in taking appropriate action in the target country in the case of such transactions.
Proper transposition, implementation and enforcement of these directives are essential for achieving the goals of the directives.
Unfortunately, a number of Member States have not yet fulfilled this obligation, which does not contribute to the building of appropriate relationships between businesses and consumers.
In 2007 the European Commission used for the first time the 'EU Sweep' as a tool to check and enforce the implementation of consumer protection legislation as regards airline websites.
Irregularities were confirmed on as many as 43.6% of the websites reviewed, which only confirms the necessity of greater monitoring in relation to the enforcement of existing provisions.
I welcome the Commission's initiative concerning the creation of a publicly accessible database of national measures adopted in transposition of these directives.
<D>
Mr President, it is a shame that the climate plan has been watered down so much after the Council meeting last week.
It now most resembles industry's dream plan.
It will provide the opportunity to indicate good intentions at a symbolic level, but on a practical level very little will happen.
The idea of storing CO2 underground is totally absurd.
CO2 is a pollutant whether it is in the air or under the ground.
We cannot base our efforts to protect the climate on hiding pollution away for future generations.
The proposal on the table is even based on a non-existent technology.
Uncertain forecasts indicate that it will be developed by 2015 at the earliest, perhaps as late as 2020, and, furthermore, it reduces energy efficiency, which is directly contrary to the general objectives of the climate plan.
Bridging technology in this context means that money will be invested in something that has no future, money that could instead be used to develop the renewable energy sector.
I hope we vote against this.
<D>
(SK) Please allow me as an introduction to thank the rapporteur, Mr Chatzimarkakis, for his excellent report, which takes into consideration and pragmatically addresses all aspects of the regulatory framework, which are so important to the future of the automotive industry.
When we talk in this report about the European automotive industry's ability to compete under the conditions of global development, we have to take into consideration, above all, those aspects that could significantly limit this ability.
I thought originally that it was not necessary to remind the European Commission of the significance of this industry to the economic and social development of the European Union, but since the Commission came up with the proposal of setting emission standards for new private cars, I am no longer so sure.
If that is correct, then the Commission would obviously pay more respect to the majority view of the European Parliament, as well as to the views of the expert groups who are advocating a more integrated approach.
The European Parliament is also critically considering the time within which the European automotive industry is able to meet the technologically ambitious emissions targets such in a way that would have the minimum impact on the European industry's ability to compete.
The European Parliament expressed this clearly in the report by Mr Davies and in this very report: by majority vote the committee expressed its belief that the car companies could reach the CO2 level of 125 g/km by 2015.
If we really hope to reduce emissions throughout the automotive sector, we must have a more comprehensive understanding of these issues.
The proposed step would definitely lead to a slowdown in the exchange of old cars, besides other negative impacts, such as the inability of less wealthy citizens to purchase new cars.
This aspect would be most likely to prevail in the new Member States where the level of exchanging old cars for new is, for economic reasons, low.
This certainly would not contribute to the reduction of CO2, quite the contrary.
<D>
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PL) Mr President, in the report under consideration there are some important statements and they come at a good time.
The situation in the countries to which the report relates (I am speaking mostly about the eastern area) is a very dynamic one, bringing, as can be expected, many new experiences.
It is very good that European institutions - the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament - are speaking with a common voice, a voice that reflects the function for which the institutions were created, and for these introductory statements I would like to thank the Commissioner and the Minister.
I would also like to thank the rapporteurs.
The Socialist Group in the European Parliament supports the development of a European Neighbourhood Policy, a strengthened European Neighbourhood Policy, provided that it is prudent and effective.
During work on this report we avoided many unnecessary disputes.
We avoided a rather unwise discussion on whether neighbourliness with the East is more important, or neighbourliness with the South.
That would be like asking a child 'who do you love more, your Mummy or your Daddy?'
We avoided any unnecessary debate on whether or not a European Neighbourhood Policy takes the place of a policy aimed at EU enlargement.
These, too, are unreal dilemmas, but these matters received clarification.
A European Neighbourhood Policy can be effective if it is carried out jointly.
'Jointly' means that it is carried out by the European Union as well as by interested countries.
It cannot be the same towards all countries, because these countries have different degrees of democracy and are interested in implementing this policy in different ways.
How delicate a matter this is you have seen for yourselves, in observing what took place recently in Georgia, which has just been the subject of discussion.
Satisfaction because of another democratic election in Ukraine has been clouded by the fact that these were the second elections in two years in that country.
One could say a mixed satisfaction.
As far as the East is concerned, our policy relates to an area that is constantly troubled by intrigue organised by the Russian Federation, whether this is obvious or hidden.
Finally, as the Minister said, this policy can only be successful if it is accompanied by resources, political will, effective action and an absence of naivety, especially if the creation of new institutions is involved.
<D>
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Madam Vice-President, the European Commission has done outstanding work in the last few years in many areas, notably environmental and climate policy, and here in this House, we are in the process of translating this into legislation.
As regards the development of the common market, however, we see major shortcomings, especially where the social dimension is concerned.
The current financial crisis is sufficient reason to discuss this issue, and that is what we have done in the context of the Rasmussen report.
It is not only my group and I, and indeed many others, who are deeply disappointed by what Commissioner McCreevy has said - or has not said - here.
That is the major problem.
If we read the lead articles in any conservative newspaper today, whether it be the Financial Times or the Frankfurter Allgemeine, the headlines could have been written by socialist groups in this House, but not by the Commission President and certainly not by Mr McCreevy.
The Financial Times, for example, has had the following headlines:
'Modern history's greatest regulatory failure' or 'After the crash: why global capitalism needs global rules'.
While Damien Hurst's The Golden Calf broke art auction records, the financial institutions have suffered record losses, prompting the following comment from the Financial Times:
'How we were all blinded by the golden calf'.
(DE) Unfortunately, this applies to the Commission, or at least to those members of the Commission who should be responsible for these issues.
Frank Schirrmacher, the editor-in-chief of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung and hardly a left-winger, writes: 'Neoliberal ideology created a rational and fortuitous connection between the individual and globalisation which was rooted solely in the economy', and laments 'the self-destruction of the social welfare discourse'.
It would be nice to have detected at least an element of this in the words of the Commission President or Commissioner McCreevy.
After all, I am not demanding a large amount of left-wing criticism or self-criticism, but what we are demanding, time and again, as Martin Schulz recently made very clear, is the strengthening of the social dimension and scrutiny of all Commission projects in terms of their social impacts.
Unfortunately, this is still not happening.
There is no response from the Commission here.
What we are also demanding is a stronger common economic policy in Europe, which could also help to cushion or avert the type of crisis now spilling over from the US.
Here, too, the Commission has been notable for its omissions.
Another area where the Commission has failed - and I am sorry to address these comments to you as I know you can do very little about it - is its failure to tackle the growing inequality in Europe of its own accord, or to urge the national governments to act.
We will be debating this issue this afternoon in relation to energy poverty, another topic which we have repeatedly raised and where we have received no response from the Commission, which has yet to produce any real initiatives here.
It is unacceptable for the Commission - with its commitment to inclusion and social justice as a matter of principle - to stand by and watch while social inequality in Europe steadily increases during this particular phase of economic and social life.
That is unacceptable, and we should not be accepting it.
Europe's citizens expect the Commission to take their needs and concerns seriously, to present appropriate proposals and to act as a moral authority, notably in the context of the financial crisis.
It should not be left to the French President, Mr Sarkozy, in his capacity as President-in-Office of the Council, to take a clear position here; this clear position should come from the Commission, the Commission President and the relevant Commissioner as well.
Madam Vice-President, you are very eloquent in your endeavours to inform citizens about the Commission's work, and we pay tribute to and fully support your efforts.
However, it is not just about form; it is also about substance.
The Commissioners must provide you with appropriate content.
When it comes to the financial crisis, regulation and the social dimension, the social market economy is supplying you with too little content.
That is why you will often find it difficult to present a credible case to citizens.
We say 'yes' to the ecological restructuring of our economy and society; we are completely on your side here and will translate this into action.
However, my urgent message to you is this: we need to take a step back - or a step forward, if you like - towards policies based on social responsibility, and that means the Commission as well, for what we are getting here is too little, too late.
I would ask you to ensure that this situation is remedied in the next few months.
<D>
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, the agreed CRD text is a good step forward on core capital, exposures and supervision.
The securitisation provision, now with proportional penalties for due diligence failures, is not perfect but it is fit for purpose - the purpose to rebuild confidence and repair the securitisation market.
Review at the end of the year on the retention per cent means we have covered all bases, including international cooperation.
European problems with securitisation came on the buy-side from the US, but fear has dried up our own securitisation.
Banks have lost the main instrument that enabled them to sell on their loans - an important instrument because it freed up capital for further lending and was a major driver for growth.
In 2006-7 European securitisations totalled EUR 800 billion: EUR 526 billion supporting European mortgages and tens of billions each on car purchases, credit card spending and SME loans - yes, including something like EUR 40 billion of German SME loans.
These are the very areas where the credit crunch is biting hardest.
It is no coincidence.
Because we have to face the fact that bank lending is limited by their capital and they are stuck until either more capital is raised or the loan sold on.
So the sooner that we can get Europe's quality control securitisation working, the better.
It may seem that, if 5% retention guarantees good behaviour by banks, then 10% would guarantee it more, but the retained portion attracts a capital charge so it reduces the capital that can be freed up and in turn restricts lending.
A 10% hit during times of ongoing capital stress would just hurt borrowers and businesses, not banks.
That is why other forums - also having started with higher retention proposals - are tending to settle on 5% too.
Ultimately, it will be intelligent supervisory vigilance that will prevent future new abuses rather than regulation for the old and gone.
On Level 3 committees we can see that, despite the problems and failures in supervision, it is Parliament that has recognised better than Member States that holes cannot be plugged without resources.
It has followed this by demanding more resources for those committees.
International accounting and audit bodies will also benefit from more diversified neutral funding and the EU can lead off on this, but not indefinitely if other countries do not join in.
I am pleased to have clarified that.
Funding should also be sought from the user-side such as investors.
<D>
in writing. - The effects of climate change are being felt now: temperatures are rising, icecaps and glaciers are melting and extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and more intense.
The UN estimates that all but one of its emergency appeals for humanitarian aid in 2007 were climate related.
We need a global energy revolution towards a sustainable economic model, which provides for environmental quality to go hand in hand with economic growth, wealth creation and technological advancement.
Ireland's per capita carbon emission is 17.5 tonnes per annum.
By 2050, this will need to be reduced to 1 or 2 tonnes of carbon.
Clearly, this means radical change in the production and consumption of energy.
The first step is a comprehensive agreement in Copenhagen binding the international community to mandatory reductions and providing for sanctions at international level for non-compliance.
Indeed, the international community should show commitment exceeding that shown to tackle the financial crisis.
The response to climate change lies in strong international governance and financial commitment.
Aid to the developing world must be in addition to Overseas Development Aid or risk not attaining the Millennium Development Goals.
Indeed, climate change will require increased investment in the public sector.
<D>
Mr President, I should like to say thank you and welcome to the Commissioner.
If you have not heard it already, Commissioner, the message coming very clearly from this House is that electronic tagging is a very bad idea and it must be put to bed.
If this report - and I thank Liam Aylward for his work on it - achieves anything, I would hope that it would achieve a bit of realism on electronic tagging of sheep.
You have heard the reasons - it is not practical, it is too costly and sheep farmers quite simply will not wear it.
Irish sheep farmers are in an angry mood at the moment - as you know, we have taken a vote on the Lisbon Treaty - and it would be rather practical if the Commission could say, 'Let's listen to them and put this one to bed'.
Do not bring it in.
I would like to say a few things about the report, which details the problems in the sheep sector and does it particularly well.
The real solution for sheep farmers is better market prices and, if we cannot get those, a better share of the price we, as consumers, pay for lamb.
We need to encourage young people to start eating this meat which, as you have heard, is a healthy product.
So measures in terms of marketing initiatives to help that are very important.
I worry about Article 69.
We are simply cross-subsidising between farmers and I am not so sure that would go down very well with farmers from whom the money will be taken.
I support the idea of an environmental-linked payment but I am a little concerned.
We had them before and there were problems on the mountains because of it.
Then - guess what - we decoupled, hoping to solve that problem, and now we are trying to recouple.
But the sheep sector needs additional payments to keep farmers in business, particularly in sensitive areas.
Moving on to the task force: I am not a great fan of task forces but I am happy to support this idea if the rapporteur, as he has said, is prepared to stick with it and make sure work happens.
Could I ask the Commission to clarify how many people, if any, are working in the Commission on sheepmeat?
I gather very few.
I think there is one person, but I would like to know.
Briefly, the experience in Ireland of a sheep strategy report is not good.
A year and a half ago EUR 28 million were promised, with great fanfare, to Irish farmers.
Guess what?
To date EUR 9 000 have been delivered.
I hope this report does somewhat better.
<D>
Mr President, for more than nine years, I have had the great privilege of representing Scotland here in this Parliament, during which time we have had many a debate on the future shape of Europe and we have welcomed 12 new Member States to the top table.
This massive expansion of the internal market and other areas of cooperation is good for Scotland and good for Europe as a whole.
But, also in the past nine years, we have had to agonise over so-called crises, such as the resignation of the Santer Commission and the rejection of the Constitutional Treaty.
It is a great pity and a frustration that many of the positives which EU membership entails have been tempered by such self-inflicted negatives.
In Scotland, we move on too.
We have a new Government - an SNP Government, which is pro-European and which has a vision for a new future for Scotland in Europe.
Prime Minister, I want to see Scottish Ministers sitting alongside your Ministers in the Council, not in the second row.
Scotland has much to contribute to the European Union and its development: a constructive attitude and a wealth of energy resources to name but two.
I look forward to a day when Scotland is welcomed as an independent Member State of this Union.
Such a change, I think, would not just be good for Scotland but good for the future of Europe too.
<D>
I endorsed this document because it proposes laying down rules on the presence of non-textile parts of animal origin in certain products, as well as indicating products' origins precisely.
Above all, this regulation should provide for requirements to indicate non-textile parts of animal origin when labelling or marking textile products, so that consumers can make a choice on the basis of the information in their possession.
Labelling or marking should not be misleading and should be provided in such a way that the consumer can easily understand to which part of the product the particulars refer.
of origin, indication of fibres of animal origin, and more rigorous requirements concerning the use of harmful substances in the production of textiles.
Parliament managed to convince the Council that it was essential to clearly label fibres of animal origin.
This provision is very useful, in particular, for those consumers who have an allergy to leather goods, and to consumers who, for ideological reasons, do not want to buy textiles containing elements of animal origin.
I hope that in the near future, we will also be successful in achieving an understanding on indicating the origin of goods.
This issue has remained unresolved for too long.
I think that European firms and consumers will benefit from clearly formulated principles.
<D>
Let us begin with the assumption, as stated in the report, that the 'transparency of political institutions is a prerequisite for legitimacy.
It should be easy to scrutinise how decisions are made, what are the influences behind them and finally, how resources [...] are allocated'.
The institutions' transparency and the clarity of their representatives' actions should be an intrinsic element of real and genuine democracy.
Unfortunately, we know that there is sometimes a great difference between the nice-sounding words that are said and what is done.
Parliament was the first European institution to broach the subject of the increasing number of lobbies at European level, having launched the register for representatives of interest groups in 1996.
The Commission later also began initiatives in this area, and a working group was established in 2008 between Parliament and the Commission.
In 2009, the group approved a joint declaration and a proposal for a common code of conduct.
In 2010, a new working group approved a draft agreement for the establishment of a 'transparency register' which ensures the widest possible participation of all categories of operator, while respecting their different or specific identities.
It is important to monitor the practical results of this.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, the message I am getting from the governments is that this is an Irish problem.
When I talk to citizens, the message I get from them is that this is a European problem, and a conflict with Europe.
The governments tell us that it is a diplomatic conflict.
The citizens tell us that it is an affront to their sovereignty; they feel that they are being excluded, and they feel deeply aggrieved.
The governments tell us that this 'no' vote is incomprehensible.
When I listen to the citizens, they tell us that it is the Treaty and the process which are incomprehensible.
The governments tell us that they have to tackle the real agenda.
The citizens tell us that for years, they have been drawing attention to the real agenda, and may I say to the Commission President that they do not mean the military, police and internal security: they mean social responsibility and a European answer to globalisation.
They mean more democracy and transparency.
Mr President-in-Office, the governments plan to ask the Irish Government what prompted the 'no' vote.
Instead, the governments should be asking themselves this: who is really to blame?
The governments ignored the writing on the wall after the 'no' vote in France and the Netherlands.
Have the governments genuinely addressed the real issues?
When overhauling the Treaty, did they really respond to disappointed expectations?
Were the French not vocal enough in their calls for a new social order, more social responsibility and equity?
Were the demands for more democracy simply not clear enough?
So what did you do?
You just rehashed the Treaty and created an unreadable hotch-potch of footnotes, cross-references and subtext, and you wonder why citizens are rejecting it.
There is one major risk in this affront to sovereignty.
It is not only an affront to the Irish people; there is a real risk that this sense of grievance will spread and that Europeans as a whole will say: the Irish people have voted for us!
The responsibility for that lies with you, the governments!
The time really has come .
(The President cut off the speaker)
<D>
Mr President, it is almost two years since Parliament decided to set up a Temporary Committee of enquiry; a decision that was pushed through despite strong opposition and substantiated objections.
Now, two years later, the objections of the time are being raised again.
Today we are debating two reports: Mr Marty's report and Mr Fava's report.
The latter report does not add anything new to the report by Mr Marty that we were already familiar with at the time.
The Council of Europe's report was balanced and cautious in directing accusations at Member States.
Unfortunately, that cannot be said of the report in this House.
The fact that we are today debating both reports can be said to be progress.
That progress in the field of cooperation is fortunately also taking shape in the agency for fundamental rights.
The Conference of Chairmen of the political groups has rightly called for good cooperation between Parliament and the Council of Europe.
Where fundamental rights are at stake, cooperation is essential, because the protection of fundamental rights is extremely important.
If that is the purpose of enquiries into the actions of the American security services on European territory, the Council must also address its efforts to that.
Can agreements be made in transatlantic relations on combating terrorism or is it to remain at the level of unilaterally imposed measures?
With all measures against terrorism, the attention given to rights is often inadequate.
After two enquiries, it is time to look forward and to work on restoring relations with the United States as equals.
I would very much like to hear from the Council what it plans to do in concrete terms to restore relations.
Are we going to continue to put pressure on the United States to clear up the question of whether there were secret detention camps on EU territory or are we going to try to prevent it from happening again?
Finally, I have a question for the President.
In the debate on 14 February I asked whether we could be given an indication of the costs of the enquiries carried out by the Temporary Committee.
To date no information has been forthcoming on that.
Mr President, can you arrange for a financial report in addition to the enquiry report and is it also possible for the Council of Europe to also provide some information on the costs incurred by Mr Marty's enquiry.
Mr Gawronski is right: this is about spending tax payers' money.
<D>
(CS) Madam President, to start with I would like to say many thanks to the Commissioner for her reply to my question, which concerned the criminal liability of persons in Georgia.
It is a very sensitive issue, which was also dealt with in the pre-election discussions in Georgia.
I would like to mention that the previous speaker stated that Russia has imperialistic intentions.
Yes, that is possible.
However, I have to say that the Caucasus is neither the Alps nor the Pyrenees.
The Caucasus is just the Caucasus, and for us it is necessary to understand it in its geographical context.
I had prepared a longer speech, but I will summarise my mission as an electoral observer in Georgia in seven points.
Firstly, just like the large majority of the people in the Caucasus region, we in Western, Central and Eastern Europe also want to see stability in this region.
It is possible that this stability will be achieved with the support of the United States or the European Union.
Secondly, it is our duty as Members of the European Parliament to question the use of the financial resources that the European Union provided for relevant programmes.
They should not be used for the election of President Saakashvili.
Thirdly, it is charming that the old-new President is suggesting a dialogue with Russia; however, a rule applies that, just like at an official ball, if you offer an arm to a lady it does not mean that you will be dancing the way she wishes.
What I want to say is: if President Saakashvili is suggesting dialogue with Russia, it is necessary for the other party to understand that this is a genuine invitation to dance.
Fourthly, all countries are interested in the Caucasus, including the United States and the countries of the European Union.
Unfortunately, the European Union barely registers in the Caucasus.
Commissioner, I have to admit that the European Union's concern for this region is not obvious, and that includes its concern for the poverty there.
In this sense our common European policy will have to be better formulated; it should not just be words, but also actions and finances.
<D>
(SK) Since the euro is an important symbol of removing barriers and bringing Europeans together, the adoption of the euro by Slovakia is yet another historical step in the process of European integration.
The preparations for the adoption of the euro by Slovakia had begun even before the Slovak Republic joined the European Union.
The previous Slovak Government, led by Mikuláš Dzurinda, approved the strategy for the adoption of the euro as far back as 2003.
It implemented important reforms that made Slovakia a successful country, economically and politically.
As inflation has increased in Slovenia since the country adopted the euro, the issue of the sustainability of inflation and the public deficit causes anxiety in Slovakia.
However, I do not agree with the views of some of my colleagues that additional criteria for monitoring the economic stability of Slovakia are needed.
Slovakia meets all of the Maastricht criteria, which are the conditions for the adoption of the euro.
It is too late for a debate on setting the Maastricht criteria for fast-growing economies.
Instead I would like to mention the reason for the change in the central parity, which the German Members presented as a negative phenomenon.
The central parity shift reflected, on two occasions, the economic development of the country, which was backed up mostly by productivity growth.
I call on the Government of the Slovak Republic to step up the campaign targeted at the citizens, in particular the provision of information to vulnerable groups.
I think that dual price display should be obligatory not only for six months before entering the eurozone but also for at least one year after adopting the euro.
This will help consumers to get used to euro prices.
I am convinced that a good competitive business environment will result in more choices for consumers, which is the best remedy for rising prices.
I believe that Slovakia will also learn from the experience of those countries that have already adopted the euro.
To conclude, I would like to congratulate my colleague, Mr David Casa, for his support for Slovakia's accession to the eurozone.
I believe that his name will go down in the history of the Slovak Republic.
<D>
President-in-Office of the Council. - (CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur Rumiana Jeleva for the two excellent reports she has produced.
I expect my comments on the reports and their conclusions will be relatively brief.
On 11 June 2007, at the first informal meeting of ministers on questions of disability, the Council adopted a clear position supporting the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
At this meeting the Council approved the UN Convention as a basic step concerning support, protection and adequate implementation of human rights and basic freedoms for all persons with disabilities.
At the same time the ministers made a commitment to a further development of relevant policies with the aim of securing a full implementation of the Convention.
They called on the Commission to ensure that the new priorities of the European Action Plan in the area of disability contribute to the effective implementation of the UN Convention.
In its resolution concerning activities linked to the European Year of Equal Opportunities in 2007, adopted in December 2007, the Council called on the Commission and the Member States to continue with the process of signing, concluding and ratifying the UN Convention in accordance with their respective powers.
On 10 March 2008 the Council adopted a resolution on the position of disabled persons in the European Union.
In the resolution the Council called on the Member States and the Commission to ensure, in accordance with their respective powers, that persons with disabilities were able to access all of their human rights.
This includes the ratification, the conclusion and the implementation of the UN Convention including common European solutions within the framework of a managed and coordinated approach to the implementation of this convention.
The Council subsequently received from the Commission a draft Council decision on the conclusion of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Physical Disabilities by the European Community.
The review of this proposal began at the end of last year and the Council is still dealing with it.
Ladies and gentlemen, as your report emphasised, a number of important questions arise from the report in connection with authority and these questions require further discussion in the Council.
However, the Presidency has made a commitment to try and complete the negotiations as soon as possible, in order for the Convention to be concluded soon by the Community.
I would like to thank Parliament for the interest it has shown in this topic.
The Presidency will keep you informed about progress in the talks that are underway in the Council.
<D>
(FR) Mr President, my first reaction to the discussion that has taken place on this proposal for a framework directive was to ask myself whether we really needed such a text and whether such a solution was really appropriate.
We already have a raft of regulations on soil protection, waste, pesticides, the protection of the natural environment, groundwater and so on.
Moreover, in the context of 'better regulation', which is something we in Parliament have been working on for some time, I realise that it is important not to give the impression that we are once again just putting things through the Commission mill and accumulating one regulation after another.
I was also thinking about our local representatives and about our municipal mayors who will have even more on their plate with this framework directive.
There is another reality, however.
The fact is that human practices have failed completely to treat our soil with respect and that efforts have been systematically made to engage in intensive production methods and in so doing to impoverish the soil and to adopt urban practices that have led to its degradation.
I believe that Mrs Gutiérrez, whose work I would describe as remarkable, has presented us with very acceptable proposals in an effort to bring the different sides closer together - because indeed we see that there really is quite marked opposition within Parliament, just as there is within the Council - and that by listening to Parliament she has finally succeeded in putting forward proposals that appear to be as consensual as possible.
She has produced a set of balanced positions that respect the subsidiarity principle, particularly in the choice of methods that the Member States are required to adopt in order to put the soil regulations into practice.
She has avoided any increase in the administrative burden by urging us to make up for the errors of the past by way of our agricultural, industrial and urban practices, which until now have failed to respect the soil.
I now address the Council: when the Council Presidency tells us that we need not hurry, this means that they are going to put the dossier on hold.
They are going to put it on hold when there is in fact a real need, given the disparity that exists between the Member States, to take up positions that while respecting the subsidiarity principle are clearly aimed at preserving and protecting our soil.
<D>
The European Commission is proposing to make 2010 the 'European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion'.
With the largest ever budget for a European year, the political connotations of the project are all too clear.
This year of 'combat' will serve merely to boost the image of a European Union which is witnessing the complete failure of its Lisbon Strategy.
Although the fight against poverty and social exclusion is a priority and must be supported, despite all of these pious hopes, Europe will have done nothing to improve the lives of the 78 million Europeans living below the poverty threshold.
This is why I will be voting against this report, the sole acknowledged political aim of which is to pander to the propaganda of the euro-globalists.
Following the Irish 'no' vote, it is time for the arrogance of the ultra-Europeans to be replaced by an objective review of current European integration.
This absurd system urgently needs to be reformed if we are to maintain a Europe of cooperation and not one of submission.
A Europe of nations must finally emerge that fosters Community protection and preference for Europeans.
<D>
in writing. - Humane society can function only based on the principle of intergenerational justice and solidarity.
There can be no justice without solidarity.
Europe has to face two problems - the high unemployment rate among the young generation and uncertainty over the capacities to finance retirement funds.
The proportion of people aged over 60 years will increase every year by two millions (beginning from 2015).
At the same time, the fundamental issue to address is the declining birth rate - the process that has continued for several decades.
This will put an increasingly heavy burden on the young generation whose numbers are diminishing and can lead to conflicts over burden sharing.
Older people should be seen as an asset.
Their experience and readiness to actively participate in society building should be encouraged at every level.
Member states should value and recognise the informal activities in strengthening the intergenerational solidarity by millions of elderly family members who take care of both younger and older members of the society.
One of the key solutions is better involving civil society that has a long tradition of organising social support.
I also support the initiative by the AGE platform to declare 2012 the year of intergenerational solidarity.
<D>
(CS) The European Strategy for the Danube Region is important for the development of the entire Danube river basin region.
There are many common topics.
I would like to single out here just some of the subjects which are also of importance for the countries falling into the wider concept of the Danube Region, such as, the Czech Republic, for example.
One of them is the field of water management, complete with flood control.
Since devastating floods have repeatedly occurred in this region, an integrated approach in this field is imperative.
Another topic includes large-scale investment activities aimed at ensuring better transport links within the region and its connection with the neighbouring regions.
It would be appropriate to also take this macro-regional aspect into consideration in the scheduled revision of the TEN-T network.
The individual projects should not be mutually competitive.
It is vital to stipulate clear-cut priorities, while the projects should have a sustainable character, be environmentally friendly, and enjoy evident support from local and regional self-government authorities and the public.
Not isolated projects, but rather cooperation within the region with a supra-regional perspective can ensure the sustainable development of the Danube Region in the future.
At the same time, the European Strategy for the Danube Region may prove to be a comprehensible and stabilising development framework for the Member States as well as for the countries that are outside the European Union, but which are striving to cooperate, either as candidate countries or on the basis of Neighbourhood Policy.
<D>
Europe is currently going through a difficult period.
The financial crisis of 2008-2009 is still being strongly felt in the economy, which is causing a widening of the gap between the wealthy regions of Western Europe and the poorer regions of Central and Southern Europe.
This situation is making it necessary to strengthen mechanisms which are effective in fighting the crisis.
The most important of these at Union level are cohesion policy and the regional funds.
As a result of the cofinancing of investment at local level, they have become an effective symbol of a European cooperation which has risen above national interests.
They also made a significant contribution to extending the area which enjoyed economic growth between 2004 and 2007, as well as to reducing the gap between the countries of the old and the new Europe.
This is why it has become so important to increase Union funds for cohesion policy in the Financial Framework for 2013-2020, to maintain convergence as a primary objective, and to maintain the current mechanism for selecting beneficiaries based on GDP levels in different regions.
I think the possibility of raising the level of investment cofinancing from 75% to 80% while, at the same time, reducing financing for the remote regions is also important.
From the point of view of the countries of Western Europe, I think it is also important to continue the financing of infrastructural investments, particularly in the vertical strip which joins the north and south of Europe.
<D>
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you, Mrs Angelilli, for that important gesture, which illustrates how different the attitude of this House is to that of the European Union, which, like Pontius Pilate, is hypocritically washing its hands of the affair, while in fact there are two countries involved in this case: Italy, which has paid an extraordinarily high price for terrorism with its victims and very difficult years, and France, which is involved up to its neck thanks to the woeful interest of the infamous left-wing 'caviar' lobby, which already distinguished itself in the Petrella case and probably also in the role of the secret services.
In this way, Europe is undermining its anti-terrorism directives and losing all authority in the global strategy for combating terrorism.
I wonder whether the same thing would have happened if it had been perhaps a German terrorist from the Red Army Faction?
Europe is, however, saying to Brazil that to fail to extradite a common criminal and communist like Battisti, who today even in prison dares to mock his victims, would be to downgrade itself to a country of refuge for the worst criminals and terrorists.
Such behaviour would call into question all partnership agreements and, I believe, participation in the G8.
We must emphasise quite clearly: it is not acceptable to make agreements with terrorists.
Terrorists, sentenced under lawful proceedings - because our country has a great legal system, where no one is tortured and proceedings are legitimate - must then serve their sentence to the very last day.

in writing. - (FI) Here, we are discussing stress tests for nuclear power plants because of Fukushima.
I recall the part-session in April, at which some Members seemed to lose all sense of proportion right after the accident.
Some associated the thousands of victims of the tsunami with the damage to the nuclear power plant.
People in the House wondered if the thousands of victims were not enough.
They asked how many nuclear accidents would it actually take before there was sufficient evidence.
I could not believe my ears.
Even now, there are no actual victims who have died from radiation at Fukushima.
Despite the fact that Japan suffered one of the biggest ever earthquakes recorded, followed by one of the biggest tsunamis that has ever occurred, even though they were not prepared for them, even though they had not even carried out the improvements suggested, even though nothing had been done to ensure that there would be a supply of power in the event of emergencies, and even though the Japanese made other mistakes right at the start, there were few personal injuries.
There is no doubt, of course, that the accident at Fukushima was a catastrophe.
It should not have happened.
There are likely to be fatalities, but they will be nothing compared to the fatalities due to coal power, for example.
In Europe, airborne fine particles due to energy consumption now kill around 300 000 people each year.
It is therefore paradoxical that the Fukushima accident will lead to tens of thousands of indirect victims.
They will die prematurely because Europe will give up using nuclear power and replace it with fossil energy.
Air quality will worsen, which will increase the incidence of cardiovascular disease and threaten the lives of asthma sufferers.
The real killer behind the Fukushima disaster is therefore coal, to which they are now switching in Germany, for example.

Member of the Commission. - As you know, Slovakia joined the euro zone on 1 January this year, so we now have 16 of the 27 EU Member States participating fully in the EMU and sharing the same currency.
Who will be the next?
It is not up to the Commission to answer that question.
It is up to the candidates who wish to join the euro area to apply.
At the present time we know which EU Member States would like to join the euro area as soon as possible but unfortunately do not fulfil all the criteria required by the Treaty - the Baltic states, Hungary and others - and we know that there are two EU Member States, namely the UK and Denmark, that got an opt-out so that they can be excluded from the responsibility of all EU Member States to prepare themselves and their economies to join the euro area one day.
I do not know who will be the first to join the euro area after Slovakia.
It could perhaps be one of the two Member States with an opt-out.
It is possible that in the coming months Denmark, for instance, might decide to no longer have an opt-out and to apply to join the euro area.
In fact, Denmark fulfils all the criteria to join the euro area according to the Treaty, but it is up to the Danish authorities, the Danish Parliament and maybe the Danish citizens in a referendum, to decide.
This morning we were commemorating here the 10th anniversary of the euro.
I am sure that in the next 10 years all - or almost all - the EU Member States will join the euro area because, in these times of crisis during this difficult economic period, the advantages of being a member of the euro area have increased a great deal.
Those who have not yet joined the euro area realise that the advantages are much bigger and much more important than the responsibilities they must bear as members of the euro area, or the difficulties.
Regarding your remarks, if I were in your position I would not argue against the euro area in terms of interest rates.
Ask Denmark what has happened with their interest rates during this period of crisis.
Denmark is a non-euro-area member whose currency is linked with the euro and whose Central Bank closely follows the decisions of the European Central Bank.
The markets are not rewarding those who are not in the euro.
They are putting higher risk premiums on them.
<D>
Today, almost a thousand patients are registered for transplants in Austria.
Unfortunately not all these seriously ill patients will get the transplant that may save them.
Every year some 150 patients die while awaiting a transplant because of the very limited number of available donor organs.
Organ shortage is a major challenge facing Europe.
That is why we need a directive on the quality and safety of organ donations.
Equally, however, we need cooperation between Member States and an exchange of good practice.
There are, currently, considerable differences within Europe in the number of organ donations and in the transplant quota.
Cooperation among Member States should focus on discovering the most efficient systems, exchanging experience and promoting well-established procedures.
Member States must learn from one another.
I am convinced that live donation should always remain complementary to post-mortem donation.
Moreover, it is important for donations to remain voluntary and unpaid.
Transfers of money between donor and recipient are unacceptable.
The Commission and the Member States must take measures to combat transplant tourism and the illegal trade in organs more effectively.
<D>
(EL) Mr President, my dear colleagues, as we know, the European Commission's original proposal included in a single Regulation the amended proposal for Regulation No 11 abolishing discrimination in prices and terms of transport, and the amendment to Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs.
The Commission's proposal was based on Articles 75, 152 and 95 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, and the stipulated procedure for adopting the Resolution was co-decision.
The colegislators - Council and Parliament - decided to split the original proposal into two separate Regulations: one for the amendment of Regulation No 11 on transport, based on Article 75 (3), which does not provide for any intervention by the European Parliament in the legislative procedure, and on which the Committee on Transport gave its opinion; and another Regulation concerning amendment of the Regulation on the hygiene of foodstuffs, based on Articles 95 and 152 (4b), on which the Committee on the Environment is to give its opinion shortly.
Today we are called upon to decide whether Article 75 (3) provides an adequate legal basis for amending the Regulation on transport.
The amendment to Article 852/2004, as we have said, will be discussed later.
The proposed Regulation which is submitted today provides for the deletion of Article 5, which ceased to be valid in 1961, and an amendment to Article 6, aimed at reducing the carriers' administrative obligations by abolishing their obligation to retain copies showing full price information, since this information is included anyway on the consignment notes and in the carriers' accounting systems.
This amendment makes it possible to check transport rates and conditions, and identify any discrimination.
So this is an amendment that corresponds exactly to what is provided for in Article 75 (3), second sentence, of the Treaty of the European Communities, and since the amendment to Article 6 is necessary to enable European authorities to check observance of the principle of non-discrimination in the field of transport under Article 75 (3) of the Treaty, the Committee on Legal Affairs made the point that Article 75 (3) is the only legal basis than can be used when amending Regulation No 11.
<D>
Mr President, I welcome the decision to incorporate children's rights as one of the objectives of the EU Treaty of Lisbon, providing a new legal basis for children's rights.
Ms Angelilli's report deals with many important issues relating to children's well-being and protection.
However, I want to emphasise acknowledgement of the fact that, for children, the poverty and social exclusion of their parents represent serious obstacles to exercising their rights.
I support the report's demand that the EU work in cooperation with the relevant UN agencies, international organisations and research centres to improve the gathering of comparable statistical data on the situation of children in the EU, with a view to developing and including a larger number of indicators relating specifically to children, child poverty and social exclusion.
Child poverty is a neglected issue, yet one in five children in the EU lives on the brink of poverty.
Will this not condemn 20% of the EU's future adults to never fulfilling their true potential?
If the political will is there, then let us work together across Member States to share best practice and learn from one another.
We have witnessed the EU-wide campaign to make poverty in the developing world history, so why can we not have a similar campaign, across the EU, to make child poverty history?
<D>
One of the four principles on which the European Union's common market is based relates to the free movement of people.
The free movement of people provides EU citizens with the potential to take up employment in another Member State.
Different education systems and regulations on occupational qualifications, however, often make it difficult to accept employment in occupations in which we hold qualifications.
This is why it is so important to be able to compare occupational qualifications between different Member States.
In the view of the European Commission and also of the rapporteur, Decision No 85/368/EEC, which governs this matter, has not adequately facilitated the comparability of occupational qualifications to the benefit of workers seeking employment in another Member State.
This is what lies behind the decision to replace it with a newer and more effective instrument, the European Qualifications Framework, which increases transparency, supports the transfer of qualifications and makes it easier to assess the results of study.
I am pleased that this step has drawn broad support from various areas: social partners, industry and sector organisations, educational institutions and NGOs.
This guarantees broad acceptance of the changes being made.
I am therefore in favour of rescinding the Decision, and I feel that the EQF, as a tool enabling qualifications to be compared, will provide a chance for people to move more easily and will enable the aims that were not realised through Decision No 85/368/EEC to be attained, thus ensuring greater worker mobility in the European labour market.
<D>
(SK) Mr President, I would like to thank you for giving me the floor and I would also like to thank Mrs Grossetête for the report on the proposed directive, which deals with variations to the terms of marketing authorisations for medicinal products.
I supported it in the vote.
It represents progress in the harmonisation of laws and in consumer protection, reducing bureaucracy, increasing flexibility and bringing benefits in terms of the safety and awareness of patients.
At the same time, it simplifies operations and reduces costs for medium-sized pharmaceutical firms.
I appreciate the clear stand taken by Commissioner Verheugen over counterfeit drugs, low-quality generic drugs that often have no more effect than a placebo and illicit drugs and vaccines, which find their way to European citizens via the black market.
Such activities are criminal.
In the near future, the Commission will draw up measures to strengthen existing laws in this area so that none of these drugs may be distributed.
It will also introduce sanctions against persons operating in this area.
The Commissioner has also ensured that effective drugs must be produced on the basis of recognised European standards and manufacturing processes.
<D>
Mr President, I have to answer that question because it just shows that Mr Rübig does not understand the legislation in front of him.
Because it is not defined as a firearm, you do not need a permit: anybody off the street can buy it - a criminal can buy it.
So Mr Rübig should get his facts right before he intervenes.
I rise, though, on a point of order, concerning an accusation made by Ms Goudin and I wish to correct the record of the Minutes.
No shadow has been excluded from this trialogue.
The IND/DEM Group was invited, it appointed a rapporteur 18 months ago, it did not turn up to any meetings in committee or to any hearings, and it did not turn up to any trialogues.
Ms Goudin knows very well that she was only appointed two weeks ago to take over from the shadow rapporteur, who did not turn up.
I will defend the work of our rapporteur, shadows and the committee because we take our issues seriously, we do a serious job and the IND/DEM Group should take its work seriously as well.
<D>
(FI) Mr President, I want to thank the rapporteur, Mr Musotto.
He has done a very thorough and excellent job.
This report is crucially important, and the fight against fraud is something over which the confidence of the public is either won or lost.
I think there are three very important problems contained in this report which need to be put right.
First of all, it is intolerable that some countries do not even provide information on agricultural expenditure.
Germany and Spain are prime examples of this, and Germany does not even provide details of the individuals and companies which the European Anti-Fraud Office would definitely need in order to be able to address these matters.
This is obviously something we cannot allow: all Member States must obey the rules.
If a few big countries set a bad example, the situation does not look very good.
The second issue is that notification of irregularities can take up to 39 months - more than three years.
That is far too long and does not inspire trust in the notion that the Member States are acting with sufficient vigilance.
The third issue, which is very interesting and important, is that specialised and organised crime is also occurring in this area.
This is now so serious that all measures need to be taken to cut this sort of crime.
This is a very important report and every effort needs to be made to improve the situation in order to gain public confidence.
(Applause)
<D>
in writing. - I would like to draw attention to the worrying tendency in Europe, where more and more young people suffer from mental problems.
Many young people in Europe suffer from stress; indicators of substance abuse, especially alcohol and drugs, are increasing.
These aspects, separately and combined, can lead to serious mental disorders.
Recent tragedies in Finland indicate that more than ever Member States need to pay attention to young people in providing measures for preventing bad health, especially mental health.
A holistic and proactive approach to dealing with the roots of mental problems and illnesses is crucial.
A safe living environment (preventing domestic violence and substance abuse), reducing stress-causing factors in school and at home, prevention and awareness-raising should be of the highest priority.
No school can replace a caring family where parents see their responsibility in teaching their children the basics of social and ethical values.
It is important to include all actors in society to achieve the set goals.
Various voluntary and youth organisations in particular are crucial providers of a safe environment in leisure-time activities and of non-formal education/awareness-raising on mental-health-related issues.
Therefore I call for a holistic and proactive approach including guaranteeing better mental health and therefore a better future for young people.
<D>
Mr President, many in the House have today congratulated the Irish people on their good sense in rejecting the appeals of Nigel Farage and the UK Independence Party and voting overwhelmingly in favour of the Lisbon Treaty.
Members should perhaps also commiserate with the British people, because we have to put up with Mr Farage on a daily basis.
He calls a two-to-one majority in Ireland a 'victory for bully boys'.
I am afraid his words are all too typical of a man who uses distortions and deceit, and sometimes downright lies, about the European Union.
All too often, those words are unchallenged by journalists.
However, hyperbole can turn to insanity.
Now he is comparing the campaign in Ireland with the brutality of the latest elections in Zimbabwe.
He describes the Treaty that gives every Member State the right to withdraw from the Union as an end of independence.
Nevertheless, we should be compassionate.
Parliament has a medical service.
Mr President, I invite you to ask the men in white coats to offer their services to our colleague.
Nonsense about Europe may pour from his lips but at least they can help ensure that he does not choke on it.
<D>
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen and guests, I would first like to apologise for not arriving on time and to thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak immediately after the first round of party speeches.
I very much appreciate this discussion because the speeches that have been made so far value clearly the work of the rapporteurs, the Commission and the Council.
It seems that there is a consensus in principle over the two proposals we are expecting in the first reading and I am delighted about that.
These proposals form part of the Community's sixth action programme and the attached package as published by the Commission in July 2008.
It emerges very clearly from this proposed action plan that there is a need to change behaviour patterns, consumption patterns and production patterns and that our methods of production and consumption are unsustainable.
We are damaging the climate, we are damaging human health and we are using up natural resources in an unsustainable way.
This matter is one of the priorities of the Czech Presidency and I firmly believe that through the approval and revision of the existing regulations on eco-labelling and on EMAS we will largely manage to deal with this priority.
I would like to thank the European Commission and the Member States for their work on these regulations and I would also like to express my thanks for the major work carried out by the European Parliament, by rapporteur Linda McAvan on behalf of EMAS and the rapporteur Salvatore Tatarella on the Ecolabel and everyone else taking part in this work.
As far as ecolabelling is concerned, a compromise text has been produced thanks to the combined work of the Council and Parliament together with the Commission, and this text improves the voluntary system for product labelling, particularly by simplifying the system for granting eco-labels.
It is very important that the Ecolabel should now be more attractive to consumers.
We are making it possible to extend the system to other products and we have also succeeded in solving a problem relating to the potential labelling of food products, thanks to which consumers will have the possibility to consider and take into account the impact of products or services on the environment when making purchasing choices and this is very important.
As far as the compromise text applying to EMAS is concerned, it will enable even higher visibility for organisations joining the system voluntarily, thereby increasing its attractiveness.
In my opinion it is very important to reduce the administrative burden for large, small and medium-sized companies.
There was considerable debate about the costs of this system and I think we have found a sensible compromise at a minimal cost which will still cover the transaction costs for introducing these labels.
In my opinion it is important to emphasise that the revised EMAS system is also open to organisations outside the European Union.
This in turn should give the system greater authority by encouraging application on a broader, more global scale.
I firmly believe that the approval of these regulations will be a real benefit for European countries and that it will create new opportunities that are relevant to the current crisis and to resolving the greatest global environmental problem, which is global climate change.
I would like once again to thank the European Parliament, the rapporteurs and MEPs for their productive cooperation on the compromise and I look forward to continuing this debate.
<D>
in writing. - (SV) Environmental issues are one of the most important fields for EU cooperation.
Cross-border environmental pollution in Europe cannot be tackled at national state level.
This gives the EU an obvious role in such areas.
It is, however, very worrying that the report shamelessly uses climate issues as arguments for increasing the political power of the EU and opening the doors to bureaucracy and protectionism.
There are many examples, and all of them are wrong.
The report demands common taxation, rethinking the notion of free competition and the introduction of so-called border adjustment instruments, in other words duties.
The Member States themselves must be allowed to determine how they deal with environmental policy.
It is in competition between countries and companies to find effective solutions to environmental problems that creativity can flourish, not by bureaucratising our existence.
We have therefore voted against the report.
<D>
in writing - (PL) The prospect of EU membership works as a powerful engine for change in countries interested in accession.
It encourages implementation of necessary reforms, both political and economic, and compliance with the Copenhagen criteria.
For the prospect of membership to be sustained, progress in negotiations has to be dependent on the tempo and scale of reforms carried out in the candidate country, and the EU must have the capacity to accept these countries.
We need to have a strong, cohesive and, above all, a united Community.
It is very important for the citizens of our countries to appreciate the benefits of new members joining.
Enlargement brings benefits, it brings economic and social growth to both new and existing Member States.
Successive enlargements of the European Union have been a success, for the acceding and existing Member States, and for Europe as a whole.
I am very pleased that the report points out that the road is still open for eastern European countries to become members of the European Union.
This, together with the recently adopted Eastern Partnership Programme, should encourage these countries to make efforts to adopt European democratic, economic and administrative standards.
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, first of all, may I express my sincere congratulations and thanks to Mr Jo Leinen, the rapporteur, for doing a very good job.
This report is one which my Group can fully support and we also endorse the amendments.
The report turns political parties at European level, and the new instrument of political foundations, into effective tools to increase participation by Europe's citizens and boost Europe's democratic legitimacy.
The referenda in France and the Netherlands showed that it is important to rebuild the trust of citizens, including via the political parties and the foundations.
It is also true that the financial rules need to be adapted to the rapidly changing needs of the political parties.
Transparency, of course, must be safeguarded as well.
That is why the European Parliament will be providing information on the funding disbursed to parties and foundations every financial year, and this will be available on our website.
Another good innovation is that the role of political parties in the context of the European elections is finally recognised.
Only if Europe's parties can be actively involved in elections to the European Parliament will they become genuine players of the European polis and contribute to the formation of a European consciousness, thereby helping to overcome the democratic deficit which exists.
Another important component is the promotion of political foundations.
Their work in the field of political information and education complements what the political parties do.
These foundations have a special role to play in deepening the educational process and enhancing knowledge about the European Union, thus reducing the distance between citizens and the European Union.
I am convinced that foundations can boost the active participation of citizens in European political life, and they can also play an important role in the training of tomorrow's politicians.
The legalistic thinking of the Council is rather hard to fathom, but as Helmut Kohl always said, the most important thing is the outcome.
That is why I am in favour of this report, and I would like to thank everyone concerned for their commitment and cooperation.
<D>
I am sorry but I do not think we should listen to personal comments like that in this Chamber.
(Interjection from the floor)
Your speaking time has finished.
We will not have personal comments of that nature.
(Interjection from the floor)
We shall now move to the next speaker.
<D>
(SV) There is a large group of citizens who have been ignored in the discussion on the composition of the European Parliament.
I am thinking of the almost 50 million Europeans who belong to a regional or a national linguistic minority.
Today we are only a handful of MEPs who represent these groups.
This is not acceptable and, sadly, it gives a false image of the European Parliament.
It is as if we do not understand the vulnerable position in which certain linguistic minorities still live.
The report by Mr Lamassoure and Mr Severin, which is based on the principle of 'degressive proportionality', is a brilliant display of statistical work and I too will be voting in favour of it, but we must now also dare to begin discussing other substantive issues.
How will we increase the citizens' trust in the European Union?
How will we guarantee that the EU and the European Parliament live up to the aims that we want others to pursue, that is to say how will we ensure that the voices of minorities are also heard?
Ladies and gentlemen, will we MEPs tolerate regional and national linguistic minorities being left at the mercy of the goodwill of national governments which may give them a seat, or do we want those minorities not to be represented in the European Parliament?
The answer should be a resounding no!
So as to ensure diversity it is therefore time to reserve a number of seats in the European Parliament for linguistic minorities.
I myself speak for the Swedish-speaking population of Finland and for the province of Åland.
<D>
(FR) Mr President, the Commission may have carried out a slick public relations exercise with its 'package' presentation of texts which are very different in nature and quality, but ultimately it has exercised its right of initiative on matters of major importance.
It is moving in the right direction and we should applaud that.
So the ball is back in our court and above all perhaps in the Council's.
Everyone knows that Parliament will be quite tough and will look to produce innovative texts that reflect the needs of Europe's citizens.
Will the same be true of the Council?
It is perhaps doubtful, as we know.
I hope they will listen to you, Minister.
Bombastic talk that produces only ambiguous and non-binding texts seriously undermines the credibility of the work we do.
Let us take three examples among many.
I have long been one of those calling for an overall directive against all forms of discrimination.
For that we should take as the basis the Lynne report of May 2008, which is far more ambitious than the Commission proposal.
Second example: works councils.
We shall take care to ensure that the text clarifies their international powers and responsibilities.
Consultation of the social partners is increasingly crucial in the case of restructuring operations by concerns which operate in more than one EU country.
We shall make sure that the workforce is consulted in advance of any restructuring and that works councils are able to give their views on matters which are often highly technical.
Third example: social services of general interest.
We have wasted enough time here.
Operatives in this field are confused.
There is huge legal uncertainty, damaging the quality of services that are essential to cohesion in our societies.
And here we are, about to waste another year.
It is irresponsible.
To me this is proof that the Commission's work, which appears to cover a broad sweep of areas of activity, is not good enough because it knowingly disregards certain essential points.
I will end by insisting that the social package should be just one step along the way.
I am convinced that the open coordination method has gone as far as it can in some areas.
We must resolve to go for more cooperation but also more harmonisation, wherever possible.
<D>
in writing. - (CS) First and foremost, I would like to join all those who have expressed sympathy for the people of Japan, stricken by the destructive earthquake and the tsunami.
This natural disaster has taken the lives of thousands of people, which is an appalling loss.
It has deprived further tens of thousands of their homes, personal items and belongings, dramatically changing their lives for years to come.
We must not forget this, even though the media are concentrating instead on the nuclear energy issues.
The problems of the damaged Fukushima plant almost overshadow everything else.
However, I would like to say - in connection with the alarmist scenarios - that the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki still constitute the greatest ever nuclear catastrophe.
The greatest threat to humanity is the military nuclear arsenal.
It is expanding, despite the many good intentions, and it lacks the permanent and thorough public control that we see with nuclear power plants.
Moreover, after the events in Japan, safety requirements and standards will surely be further enhanced.
We must therefore stick to a sensible position, avoiding any hasty or even hysterical reactions to the events in Japan.
There is currently no alternative to nuclear energy, which provides us with much-needed, accessible and emission-free power.
I am pleased that the Czech Republic, Finland, France and others are taking a realistic approach to the issue.
This is in contrast to countries where nuclear energy has become a pawn in pre-election battles to an extent that is almost unethical, bearing in mind the situation in Japan.
<D>
(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, regarding the controversial proposal by Mr Georg Jarzembowski, in the approved text we have succeeded in allowing passengers to be picked up or set down from trains at any station on an international route, including stations located in the same Member State.
I trust that it will by extension be possible to apply this provision to international bus services.
This issue was actually the subject of several international disputes recently.
Regarding the report by Mr Savary, I am pleased that it includes the rights of the social partners and specifications for interoperability.
However, problems concerning the financing of training, the choice of examiners and examinations for train drivers still exist.
As far as language skills are concerned, it is essential to insist on certain minimum requirements in order to ensure transport safety.
Regarding the report by Mr Sterckx, I appreciate the request for the introduction of non-discriminatory access rules for persons with reduced mobility and cyclists.
Although the text also lays down a range of clearly defined technical requirements, I am not pleased that unlike the Swiss railways we talk about penalising rather than efforts to satisfy the demand for a transport service.
All of the above measures should be reassessed within two years of their introduction; this is crucial in my opinion.
We will vote against the first report and in favour of the other two.
<D>
- (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to thank Mr Onesta, also on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance.
Incidentally we were both at a party earlier and we will soon be going back to finish the thank-yous and celebrations.
In this respect, I naturally wanted to say that we support this report, but that we also feel that the subject of the relationship with the primary committee remains a thorny topic in the Corbett reform and at this point I also would like to say something to Mr Botopoulos: it is not that the Committee on Petitions is a strange committee, it is a committee that has a very specific role and on most occasions petitions are concerned with the application of Community law, they are concerned with breaches of directives and laws that do not evidently always have a very clear relationship with the primary committee.
I would go further, and say that anybody who has had anything to do, however little, with the work of the Committee on Petitions can see that it is a sort of 'Cinderella' in our Parliament.
They will also see that the primary committee does not respond to the requests of the Committee on Petitions, it absolutely cannot be bothered to respond to anything that the Committee on Petitions says, does or proposes.
This is my fear: my fear is the fact that the Committee on Petitions, which not always, but often, is concerned with the application of Community directives, must somehow wait for permission from the committees responsible for making the laws, which therefore have a different part to play, and must also ask the permission of the Conference of Presidents when it is a simple case of checking the application, which has nothing to do, I repeat, with the legislative function of the parliamentary committees.
This is why I am expressing my concern about the reform proposed by Mr Corbett on petitions even though I agree strongly with what Mr Onesta said, and I thank you again, Vice-President, for being flexible about the time.
<D>
in writing. - The fight against terrorism has been high on the agenda of this House.
However, we must strike the right balance between the security measures and the protection of civil liberties and fundamental rights.
We also need to ensure the utmost respect for privacy and data protection.
Balance and proportionality must be the key principles on which the fight against terrorism is based.
The European Union has always demonstrated a firm commitment to the protection citizens' privacy, and that must be maintained.
The Community is based on the rule of law and all transfers of European personal data to third countries should respect procedural guarantees and defence rights.
It goes without saying that any transfers must comply with data protection legislation at national and European level.
SWIFT is a key infrastructure, and we must ensure that any requests for data transfers are duly justified, based on targeted cases and strictly subject to judicial authorisation.
The Community must take a firm stance in the negotiations with the US to ensure that SWIFT data cannot be used for any other purposes than those linked to terrorism financing.
<D>
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the President for a successful French Presidency.
I refer to its success in the international arena, having in mind the crisis in Georgia, and to its success concerning issues of importance to the ordinary citizen.
On a personal level, I am delighted that the French Presidency finalised the work on the regulation concerning cross-border maintenance payments in the European Union.
I myself have worked long and hard on this regulation.
I am therefore delighted that, pursuant to Council approval, we will at last be able to ensure proper financial support for those children who seem to have been simply forgotten by one of their parents, when that parent is resident abroad.
On the other hand, as a member of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, I am concerned about the concessions and institutional promises made to Ireland, which represent a return to the principle of one Commissioner per country.
It is anticipated that the European Union will enlarge further to include 30 or more Member States.
An equally large number of Commissioners would result in further bureaucratisation of the work of the European Commission.
The competences of the Commissioners appointed would be subdivided.
The Commission itself would become more expensive, less effective and more difficult to manage.
I also hope that the debate preceding a further referendum in Ireland will be conducted in the spirit of European solidarity, taking account of the substantive content of the Treaty of Lisbon, clearly explained, with institutional changes included.
These matters are important both for the citizens of Ireland and also for the functioning of the entire European Union.
<D>
I supported the resolution on the review of the European Neighbourhood Policy - Southern Dimension.
From the position of a member of the Committee on Women's Rights, I would like to draw particular attention to the importance of gender equality policies as an inseparable element of human rights, which is also a fundamental principle of the European Union.
Women's rights must be a priority item in talks with the countries of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP).
According to the resolution, women's rights should be included in revisions of codified law (constitutional law, criminal law, family law and all bodies of civil law), and should be included in the dialogue on human rights conducted with the ENP partner countries.
We should also focus on measures which will deepen the social integration of women.
We need programmes that promote the education of women, and we need to promote their employment and increase their participation in public life.
The effects of measures to improve gender equality in the ENP countries should be continuously monitored and supervised, and failures in this area should be categorically condemned, and even punished.
I opt for not strengthening the EU's relations with those third countries that do not sufficiently incorporate women into their policies and institutions in matters related to the organisation of civil society (in particular, human rights organisations and women's organisations).
<D>
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate is unfortunately overshadowed by the terrorist attacks in Turkey.
I would much rather have spoken about the desirability of picking up the thread of the reforms again; unfortunately, I have come to the conclusion that, despite many fine words, in practice up to now far too little has come of this.
However, I think that the main question now is: what do we think Turkey should do?
Let us drop the hypocrisy from this debate, ladies and gentlemen.
Every one of us knows, or should know, that there are no easy answers to this devilish dilemma.
On the one hand we realise, we know, that any country where fifty people have been killed in the last month has to do something in response, while at the same time many of us realise - including, I think, many in the Turkish Government - that large-scale military operations are no solution.
They do not root out the PKK, they cause immense diplomatic and political damage and - most importantly - they make a solution to the Kurdish problem in Turkey much more difficult.
Let us therefore hope that all the attempts now being made to find a diplomatic and political solution will be successful.
The problem, ultimately, does not lie in the Iraqi mountains, the problem lies in Turkey, but the solution to the problem - the Kurdish problem - is not Turks against Kurds.
In my view, the issue is one of those in Turkey, Turks and Kurds who know that the only solution to the problem is a political one - the AKP and the DTP - versus the radicals, on the Turkish side and on the Kurdish side, who are not interested in a political solution at all and who think that military violence can help: on the Turkish side the army and a section of the opposition and on the Kurdish side the PKK.
Let us be very clear: the present attacks by the PKK are, of course, directed at the Turkish state, but they are also an attack on the Kurdish DTP party in the Turkish Parliament, which is seeking a political solution to the problem.
That is why it is so important that this Parliament does indeed strongly condemn the PKK and its terrorist attacks, while at the same time expressing support for all those on the Kurdish side and on the Turkish side who are trying to find a peaceful political solution to this problem.

(DE) Mr President, within the next 20 years, the European Union will need more highly qualified workers from third countries.
Other states have been making disproportionate use of the potential in this area for years.
The regulations produced by the EU are balanced and are intended to prevent the brain drain from third countries.
The requirements at any given time will be determined by the Member States.
This all sounds very sensible but, on the other hand, we are currently threatened by recession because of the financial and economic crisis.
Unemployment will increase throughout Europe and some Member States already want to restrict the freedom of movement of workers within the European Union even further.
Would it not be more sensible, in a situation in which we are being forced to change our industrial policy because of environmental issues, to invest in more and better training programmes for highly qualified employees who have significant potential for innovation?
We must focus all our efforts on this issue instead of poaching top employees from third countries.
That alone will not be enough to secure our future in the long term.
<D>
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner thank you for your statement.
I am very grateful for the initiative by the Spanish Presidency - and this is a very Spanish event as far as I can see - in adopting this series of proposals and leading the way in this regard.
Electromobility must play a key role in future.
However, as we all know, we are still a long way from achieving comprehensive electromobility.
For that reason, we should also not make the mistake of allowing electric-car hype to arise, the claims of which we are not able to fulfil in political terms.
Therefore, we should not abandon our focus on improving conventional means of locomotion, as crude oil will probably continue to fuel our mobility for a long time yet.
The following points are crucial, however.
Firstly, as you and all of the other speakers have said, we need a European strategy for the development of standards.
The United States and China are working jointly on conductive charge couplers.
We must not lag behind in this regard.
We ought to lead the way and should not allow European vanity to take hold.
Are the French quicker, or the Germans or the Spaniards?
We should all pull together and the Commission should certainly take the lead in this.
We need to develop cost-effective, high-performance batteries.
Secondly, we need to extend network-infrastructure coverage to all areas.
For us, that means that we have to focus our subsidy options on this in a more targeted way in the area of cohesion, in the regions and also in the development of rural areas.
Citizens must be able to use electromobility across borders, otherwise they will not use this form of transport.
Thirdly, we must also take electric cars into account in our CO2 emissions calculations.
Car manufacturers that are currently carrying out fleet calculations cannot yet include electric cars.
We need to be able to take these into account in future.
Fourthly, we must provide tax relief on electric cars throughout Europe.
This applies to batteries in particular, which are still the most expensive part.
We need to carry out research in this regard, but we also need to harmonise our taxes.
<D>
in writing. - (PL) I voted in favour of the report by Mr Marcin Libicki.
This is an important report.
I would, however, like to remind you that it is incorrect to say that this issue came to the European Parliament as a result of petitions from citizens.
My colleague Mr Bogusław Sonik proposed holding a debate on the North European Pipeline many months before the petitions were received.
I am surprised by the opposition to this report.
We often talk about ecological matters and this does not arouse any opposition.
However, in this specific example, some Members do not want there to be any research into the impact of the project on the natural environment.
Why?
The answer is simple: for some countries and politicians this particular project is more important than the environment.
Perhaps for this very reason we should consider the political and economic context of the planned investment.
I am aware of the argument that this is a private project.
We should not forget, however, that former politicians figure on the board of the company that is to build this pipeline.
For Russia, using private projects to further political objectives is no problem at all.
<D>
(PT) As the honourable Member knows, in March the Council adopted a programme which is regarded as world leading on both energy issues and climate change issues.
We in the European Union will have an almost historic responsibility, I would say, at the Bali Conference, which will hopefully set new targets for CO2 emissions for post-Kyoto 2012.
The European Union will clearly have a responsibility to support and/or encourage the international community to set itself as ambitious targets as we have proposed for ourselves.
We therefore already have, Mr Paleckis, a highly ambitious programme to implement across the European Union.
Among the specific energy issues, the issue of energy saving is on the agenda at both EU level and within the individual Member States.
I can tell you that in Portugal - and I have direct experience of this - this is an extremely important issue to which we have dedicated a great deal of effort.
However, the issue of investment in new energy technologies and in sciences relating to alternative energy sources has also been mentioned.
We have much to do.
We hope that what we have to do can be done quickly and well.
We must of course now concentrate on the ambitious programme for energy and climate change that we have agreed.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I am happy to be here for the debate on Mr Bono's report and I should like to thank him for his contribution and the committee for its work.
I am sure, as he said, that culture is important to our lives and it is more and more central to the future of the European Union.
I would like to add that it defines our Community much more than business or geography.
We also need to understand that culture makes a contribution; culture creates; culture is something positive, not consuming our budgets or conflicting with our needs but bringing a lot of enrichment, including jobs and growth.
This was the first time that the European Union was able to explicitly recognise last year's summit conclusions, in the study we presented some time ago, and now in the cultural agenda for the European Union at a time of globalisation.
I would like to underline just three specific ideas or items from your report, because there are many and I will not comment on all of them.
First, you ask us to establish a European vision of culture, creativity and innovation.
The European agenda we have now agreed does exactly that.
We are strengthening the cooperation between Member States, including the promotion of creative industries.
This is one of three pillars.
Part of that work will need to look at how to measure more accurately the contribution these industries make to the economy and how best to support them.
Second, you ask us to look at the external dimension.
This is one of the three priorities of the agenda and we are very active now in encouraging our partners, our Member States, to ratify the UNESCO Convention - because not all Member States and also other countries in the world have done so - and also in ensuring its implementation.
And we are increasingly including cultural elements both in our development cooperation and in our bilateral relations with emerging economies.
Third, I agree with you that full attention has to be paid to implementing Article 151 fully in EU policies.
I have established really good contacts and cooperation with my colleagues, including Commissioner McCreevy on the internal market, on the various aspects of copyright protection.
I am confident that, with the help of all of you, we will achieve the objectives laid down in this Treaty article.
You also mention the mobility of artists and cultural workers, which is very high on our agenda, especially this year.
Member States have already constituted a working group on this topic and the Commission is implementing the pilot action on the mobility of artists proposed by this Parliament last year.
The Commission will support all these efforts, in particular with a study to better understand the links between culture, creativity and innovation, as well as another study on how to have an environment conducive to the development of creative and cultural industries, including support for small and medium-sized enterprises and risk-taking.
The results of these initiatives will feed into a Green Paper on cultural and creative industries, which the Commission plans to publish in 2009.
I am looking forward to the debate.
<D>
The fisheries policy pursued by the EU is not, and has never been, based on well thought-out, joint decisions.
Fish stocks in Europe have declined dramatically in recent years, and very little is being done to change this situation.
The fisheries policy that the EU should advocate must be permeated by long-term and far-sighted thinking.
However, Mr Busk's report does in many ways represent a positive change.
The explanatory statement claims, among other things, that the recovery of cod is a matter of utmost importance and that the best method would be to completely prohibit cod fishing, even if this measure is subsequently rejected.
Unfortunately, the amendments to the report do not reflect the concern that Mr Busk expressed in the explanatory statement.
The proposed amendments are far too feeble to have any real significance.
It is very unfortunate that the way is being opened for a review of the already inadequate regulation of fishing effort once cod stocks 'have substantially improved'.
It is reasonable to suggest that the focus should instead be on safeguarding recovery to a greater extent than is happening at present.
Only then can we begin to talk about a possible review.
The report therefore sends out completely the wrong signals, to the effect that the problem will soon be solved and we should then start to review the system.
The opposite is in fact the case.
I therefore voted against the report.
<D>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it was exactly seventy years ago, on 14 July 1938, that the fascist regime in Italy enacted the Decree on race, falling into line with the German race laws.
We know our history: more than 500 000 Roma were killed in the death camps.
Then too, it all began with a census.
In Italy we are witnessing a full-blown profiling of all Roma, including children, who are being fingerprinted, and including Community citizens and even Italian citizens, despite the fact that their details are already registered.
The questionnaire used in Naples, Mr Angelilli, contains questions about religion and ethnic origin and is very similar to the one used by the Vichy Republic under the Nazi occupation.
In Milan, they made a file on an old Roma, an Italian citizen, a survivor of deportation to the Nazi death camps.
What use will be made of these data?
Now in the Italian Parliament, chairing the Committee for Children - in total indifference and silence - is Alessandra Mussolini, the Duce's granddaughter, a coincidence that reinforces the symbolic link between the present and a past that we thought was definitively dead and buried in Italy and in Europe, yet is rearing its ugly head again today.
While history is not repeating itself, there is no doubt that the Italian Government has set in motion racist procedures that clearly run counter to Directives 2000/43/EC and 2004/38/EC.
I call on Parliament to approve this resolution, condemning the Italian Government, and on the Commission to initiate infringement proceedings against Italy as a matter of urgency.
<D>
in writing. - (EL) We oppose the reactionary restructuring of the field of research that is being promoted in the EU's basic guidelines for the creation of a European Research Area (ERA) within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy.
The ERA is encouraging conflict and competition for profit between countries and large business groups.
As a result, inequalities in scientific development will be intensified.
Incentives, subsidies and tax exemptions are increased for monopoly companies, allowing them to invest in and make use of the results for themselves.
The public sector is subordinated to the needs of the monopoly groups it serves.
The mobility of researchers between companies, universities and research centres is being promoted and the European patent system is being supported on the grounds of cost.
Everything is being subordinated to competitiveness and the rise in profitability.
In such a harshly competitive environment, which is present even in the world of research, attention will inevitably focus on the well-known 'centres of excellence' of the powerful nations.
These centres will secure the lion's share of the research programmes, which will be channels for public and private funds.
We are striving to overturn the EU's research policy.
This is part of our struggle for the complete reversal of the anti-popular policy upheld by the EU and by capitalism.
We hope to restore the social nature of science: research and science should serve today's popular needs and social welfare.
<D>
(HU) I firmly believe that the Treaty of Lisbon will undoubtedly enable Europe to function on a more secure basis and in a more logical manner, with a stronger focus on the problems affecting citizens' daily lives.
However, we must also ask what price we have paid to achieve this.
The price we have paid was actually that we have undermined our values and let pragmatism triumph over values.
You know what I am referring to here.
The European Union granted the Czech president his absurd request, not to mention that he said that a Czech opt-out was needed due to the Beneš Decrees.
Let me remind you that under the Beneš Decrees, many millions of Hungarians and Germans were disenfranchised and deported.
In my view, what the European Union did is unacceptable from a legal, political and moral perspective.
We have criticised the Czech constitutional system from a legal perspective, we have monitored the view of the Czech Parliament and we are including the document politically in any future accession, having possibly penalised a country which has nothing to do with this, Croatia.
From a moral standpoint, it is unacceptable to give an opt-out on such an issue.
<D>
Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to report on the hearing on crimes committed by totalitarian regimes in order to address legitimate concerns raised by Parliament.
On 8 April 2008 the Commission and the Slovenian Presidency held a hearing on crimes committed by totalitarian regimes.
This hearing was requested by the Council in April 2007 during the negotiations on the Framework Decision on combating racism and xenophobia.
The purpose of the hearing was to gain a better understanding of how the Member States have coped with the legacy of totalitarian crimes and of the nature of the methods and practices that have been adopted in order to face up to this challenge.
The hearing focused on two main themes: the recognition of totalitarian crimes, and reconciliation.
Given the sensitive nature of this issue and to prevent the matter from being exploited in any way, the Commission was keen for this debate to be, first and foremost, a debate among independent experts and academics from a variety of backgrounds who were committed to a scientifically based approach.
The Member States were invited to attend, as was the European Parliament, and I am delighted that many MEPs were given the opportunity to take part in the debate.
The hearing was conducive to constructive and dispassionate debate.
In general, four issues emerged from the discussions that were of particular concern to the Commission.
Firstly, there is the feeling that the old Member States should be made more aware of the tragic past of the new Member States.
This lack of recognition should be carefully reviewed so as to avoid the Union being divided on such a serious matter, one which should actually unite us.
Secondly, it emerged from the debates that establishing the truth is a prerequisite for reconciliation.
The spirit of reconciliation that informs the process of European integration is more important now than ever before.
The various experiences of reconciliation discussed during the hearing demonstrated how complex this task is, but also that there is reason to be optimistic.
They show that respect for fundamental rights is an essential factor in achieving genuine reconciliation.
Thirdly, there seem to be many different ways of dealing with the issues of recognition and reconciliation.
There is no one-size-fits-all model, and each Member State must find whichever one best suits its circumstances.
Finally, the debates revealed that the European institutions are being called on to address these issues more fully.
During the hearing, a group of participants submitted a document in which they put forward a large number of proposals for action.
The Commission has noted this call for greater European involvement on these issues; however, it must be emphasised that it is up to each Member State to find its own way of dealing with the remembrance of these crimes and of addressing these issues.
The European Union cannot replace the Member States in this task.
The European Union has very few powers to act in this area.
Its role is to facilitate this process by encouraging discussion, fostering the sharing of experience and best practices, and bringing the various players together.
All contributions to the hearing must now be analysed; however, I should like to reiterate the Commission's determination to continue the process set in motion by the Council Declaration of April 2007.
The Commission must report to the Council two years after the Framework Decision on combating racism and xenophobia enters into force, after which time, it will be possible to hold a political debate.
In the meantime, the Slovenian Presidency plans to publish the contributions received during the hearing.
For its part, the Commission intends to initiate a study to gain a factual overview of the various methods, legislation and practices used in the Member States to deal with the issue of remembering totalitarian crimes.
With regard to the importance of the educational and citizenship aspects, the Commission will also consider how existing Community programmes can be further used to raise awareness of these issues across Europe.
In conclusion, it is important to promote an objective and dispassionate discussion of these issues, and to move forward gradually within the limits of the powers of the Union.
The Commission is naturally prepared to participate fully in this process.
<D>
(ES) Madam President, for once I am glad that I am not the incumbent, glad that Mr Tajani has come, because Mr Tajani has the advantage of having been an MEP.
I know that as a former Member of this House you have experienced the frustration that we have as MEPs regarding the application of Community law.
Well, in Parliament, we do have a tendency to take the Commission to task, but I think that we are setting the Commission an impossible brief, because all Community law and all application of Community law is based on indirect application.
In other words, the Commission has only a few officials in the central headquarters where it receives some complaints and has some options for action but, at the moment, the trend is to restrict budgetary powers, and so the Commission is not going to be able to act.
All Community law, and all application of Community law, is based on action by the national authorities: national parliaments, national courts and national civil servants.
Here, on this aspect, I do not believe that we can demand too much from the Commission.
What we should do is to help the Commission, and I think that the report by Mrs Frassoni contains several points that may be useful in trying to make the application of Community law a reality.
I am referring to the points on the correlation of national measures with directives, the cooperation of national parliaments and action by national courts.
<D>
in writing. - (SV) Police and judicial cooperation falls within the third pillar and is thus exclusively intergovernmental.
The June List is in favour of increased cooperation between Member States to combat terrorism and other serious cross-border crime.
Decisions in this area should therefore not be taken by the European Parliament or any other supragovernmental body.
Minimum rules on the individual's access to legal assistance and data protection are laid down in each Member State.
Fundamental and extensive protection is already in place in this respect through the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, which has been signed by all Member States.
A functioning exchange of DNA already exists through Interpol.
It is also important to highlight the privacy aspect which the use of DNA demands.
On this point we are therefore in line with the report regarding requests for the DNA of people who have been acquitted or discharged.
The report, however, goes too far in many respects when it discusses the introduction of framework decisions in many areas such as procedural guarantees and the adoption of a general legal instrument to cover the entire area of police and judicial cooperation.
It even discusses setting up joint task forces.
A country's military resources are strictly a national matter, and must not be regulated at EU level.
The June List has therefore chosen to vote no to the report.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I consider that today's debate has been of extraordinary interest - of extraordinary interest and also of a high political level - and I should therefore like to thank all those who have spoken, including those who have said things with which I do not and cannot agree.
Some speakers have questioned whether it is necessary or important to raise such an issue in this House; I believe, however, that it has been very important.
An issue which is certainly a highly political issue has been raised: striking a balance between the right freely to express our thought, which is one of the rights that the Charter of Fundamental Rights recognises, and other fundamental rights such as the dignity of the human person, equality and non-discrimination.
May I say that those who have raised this issue, taking the view that freedom of thought makes it possible to cause offence and to stir up values running counter to the fundamental rights of the person, have distorted what freedom of thought actually means.
I always speak as I find, even when my opinions run counter to those who spoke before me.
Someone said: 'if, in a referendum, citizens come out against the Charter of Fundamental Rights, that will be an expression of freedom'.
I do not agree, because calling for a referendum against the Charter of Fundamental Rights would be to call for a referendum against citizens, since those citizens are clearly the holders and protagonists of the fundamental rights that we must now safeguard.
It is not because that principle has to be refuted, but because those who defend fundamental rights are not extremists, while those who violate and refute them, those who wish to affirm the right to incite a mob or a group of violent people to destroy Jewish graves are extremists.
That is not freedom of expression, that is violence that has to be eradicated through policies and has to be punished by the instruments of the law.
These are, in my view, the two measures for which Europe must steadfastly press.
We must not play it down.
We must not think that a single event can be underestimated because it is a single event, if that single event is a symptom of racism and intolerance, of a profound scorn for human values, we must also be worried by a single event, by a single act of violence!
Many of you have raised another, very important, issue: can the propagation of a racist message by political forces be tolerated in the name of the free expression of political thought?
Because they are elected by citizens, I believe that those in politics have a special responsibility and must not incite the mob against other citizens or other people: a sense of personal accountability.
In my view, it is difficult, and I say this frankly, to use the instruments of the law, the police or the secret services to undertake a far-reaching investigation of this or that party.
However, when this or that party publicly says that its intention is to restore racial supremacy, that is not free expression of thought, but an attack on a deep-seated foundation of Europe.
It is for those reasons that repressive action is justified, and there can be no talk of censure or of violation of the freedom of expression.
I will defend the right of those who do not agree with me to say what they wish to say, but I cannot defend the right of those who do not agree with me to incite the mob or other people to attack and to wound and kill.
In no way is that free expression of thought!
That is why today's issue is a key issue and I shall put forward similar arguments when we debate the appalling form of extremism represented by terrorism, because we can surely not draw a line between the message of racial hatred and the message of those who consider that killing people in terrorist attacks is a possible answer to society's problems.
Both are issues which - in my view, through education and prevention, by fostering tolerance, and by using the instruments of law and the instruments of enforcement - must be tackled at European level.
We can only be satisfied when we are sure that there is no room for racists, bigots and terrorists in Europe.
<D>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to welcome Mrs García Pérez's report.
As part of cohesion policy, the reforms are very important and are aimed at alleviating the adverse effects caused by the financial crisis.
The flexibility allowed in distributing Community funds will provide national economies with immediate cash flow, which will enable them to invest in the real economy.
This will have an immediate effect and we will definitely see the initial results in the following months.
The European Commission is supporting Member States' economies based on four major priorities, the most important of these being increasing the pre-financing from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and European Social Fund and increasing the support from the European Investment Bank and European Investment Fund.
In fact, in 2009 the pre-financing which the new Member States in particular receive may help to overcome the crisis, as well as establish social and territorial cohesion.
Great importance must also be attached to the report on the eligibility of investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy for housing.
The renovation of residential heating systems must feature on the European Union's agenda of priorities, bearing in mind the added value generated by this measure.
At a time when heating costs are constantly on the rise, Member States must also include in their programmes to combat the financial crisis projects which take into account energy efficiency.
They offer the following important benefits to the economy and population: a cash flow injection into the economy, along with job creation, a reduction in heating costs, protection of the environment through cutting greenhouse gas emissions, the provision of social cohesion and support for low-income families.
In Romania 1.4 million flats urgently require investment for renovation.
<D>
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal we are discussing is part of a package of EUR 5 billion allocated to the European economic recovery plan, of which EUR 1 040 is earmarked for the construction and completion of infrastructures for broadband Internet coverage in rural areas and for development in relation to the new challenges brought to light by the health check on the common agricultural policy.
In order to respond to the current financial crisis, we must take action above all in rural areas using instruments designed to help these areas emerge from the structural isolation in which they find themselves.
It is therefore crucial to guarantee the use of available Community funds, increasing their effectiveness and added value.
In the field of rural development, every possible tactic must be adopted to ensure greater financial flexibility and efficiency.
I believe it is essential for the Commission to undertake to assist Member States in the adoption of national strategies and rural development programmes aimed at boosting employment.
I am bound to say, however, that, according to the rules of the Rural Development Fund, broadband implementation projects are mainly managed by public administrations - provinces, municipalities and mountain communities - which are, however, unable to include VAT in their accounting.
This does not happen with other programmes, with other regulations underpinning the Structural Funds, where such expenditure is considered eligible.
The economic crisis has simply accentuated the difficulties that were already present for these local authorities, and thus the incidence of VAT on budgets associated with the implementation of various works is so high that there is a risk of public authorities failing to invest and the unspent resources returning to the Community budget.
Lastly, as far as the distribution of resources is concerned, I believe we must focus on the use of historical criteria, as proposed by the Commission.
<D>
Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Madam President, Mrs Schaldemose, the Commission welcomes this own-initiative report from the European Parliament.
It praises the work undertaken by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection and by you, Mrs Schaldemose, as its rapporteur, and it welcomes, in particular, the research into the issues of integrity.
As my colleague, Mr McCreevy, stressed in his previous speeches, the approaches currently used in the Member States are too different to allow a legislative initiative.
The latest discussions in the Competitiveness Council have clearly shown that the Member States would not reach agreement on such an initiative.
Moreover, the treaty offers some guiding principles.
A judgement from the Court, the Placanica verdict, delivered in March 2007, has very recently confirmed that sports betting activities do constitute services in the meaning of Article 49 of the Treaty.
The Member States have the right to legislate on gaming at a national level.
If they wish to limit gaming activities, it is up to them to carry out the research to justify these restrictions, for example, in relation to addiction or fraud.
When it is proven that these measures are necessary, the treaty requires that they be taken in a way that does not discriminate between national operators and operators based in other Member States.
The Commission intends to fulfil its duty by investigating any complaint submitted to it and will introduce any procedures needed if it is shown that the treaty has been infringed.
It is encouraging to note that, following the application of infringement procedures, some Member States, including France, Hungary and Italy, have been brought closer to the Commission and have committed to changing their legislation.
The Commission is working, of course, to help the Member States find solutions to respond to the infringement procedures.
The Commission has published research into the legal and economic aspects of the gambling market in 2006.
In these conditions, the Commission feels that there is no current need to play a bigger role in producing research into national legislation nor into wider issues such as addictions, fraud or other reprehensible activities.
However, this report provides some particularly useful clarifications.
<D>
Migration to Europe is a phenomenon which has been going on constantly for a long time, and is fostered by factors such as significant material differences in standard of living between Europe and other regions of the world.
Europe definitely needs a common approach to immigration in the EU.
The failure of one Member State to act may have a direct influence on other States.
Bad management of migration may have serious consequences for the countries of origin and for the immigrants themselves.
We should be aware that legal immigration is a beneficial phenomenon which brings opportunities to many different groups.
Migrants have played a very significant role in the development of the European Union in recent decades, and the EU still needs their work.
In connection with this a common political vision is necessary, which is based on past achievements and also has reference to the future.
To achieve that objective, more effective cooperation is needed.
There are many people who risk their lives or their health to cross the new southern and eastern borders of the EU in particular.
Thousands of them die at sea, while they are looking for a better life.
Immigration is one of the most serious challenges which Europe currently faces, and how we respond to it depends on us.
We can turn it into an opportunity, or we can do harm to many people by handling it wrongly.
<D>
Madam President, Commissioner, speaking in this debate on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, I would like to draw attention to four points.
Firstly, we should assess positively the solutions which aim to separate production and sale of electricity and gas from their transmission.
This should allow competition between producers of energy sources and so a reduction in the price of services.
Secondly, it is important that particular Member States which are obliged to introduce separation of energy production from its transmission can adopt one of three models for this: the greatest possible division of ownership, handing over network management to an independent operator, and the option of retaining integration of production and transmission of energy, but only if conditions are met which ensure that these two parts of the business will in practice operate independently.
Thirdly, the solutions regarding strengthening the position of the consumer in the electricity and gas market deserve emphasis, and especially the option to change energy supplier within a maximum of three weeks without incurring any additional charges.
Fourthly and finally, also worthy of special notice are the solutions which have a social dimension, requiring Member States to give assistance to electricity and gas consumers who cannot afford to pay their bills.
<D>
in writing. - (FR) The Corbett report recommends that, in order to save about EUR 10 million a year, we should no longer have the verbatim reports of proceedings in this Parliament translated into all the official languages.
Access to the debates in each language would then only be guaranteed by way of the audiovisual recordings available on the internet, though individual Members of Parliament would be able to request the translation of certain extracts.
However, not everyone in Europe has broadband internet access and, moreover, it has been suggested that requests by Members for translations should be restricted to some thirty pages a year.
What Mr Corbett is proposing is therefore to limit the access of European citizens to the work of those whom they have elected to represent them and to defend their interests within the European Union.
This is unacceptable.
It is all the more unacceptable because at the same time the same institution is spending EUR 100 million a year on its own propaganda.
To say nothing of the Commission, which spends more than EUR 200 million on vital activities such as the large-scale broadcasting of pornographic internet videos that are supposed to be promoting European cinema.
Fortunately, good sense - or rather the mortal fear of the electorate - has prevailed among most of our colleagues and multilingualism has been preserved.
<D>
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgetary Control. - (ES) Mr President, Commissioner, the Committee on Budgetary Control has focused its opinion for the 2008 Budget on two fundamental points:
The first is compliance with paragraph 44 of the new Interinstitutional Agreement relating to the statement of assurance and the annual certification that has to be sent by every Member State.
In this amendment we are taking up the conclusions and recommendations of the 2004 and 2005 discharge, which a minority of Member States have already applied, but we believe more should do so.
We know that the European Commission cannot evaluate the extent to which Member States have complied with this commitment until 15 February.
However, and perhaps in order to encourage the European Commission to continue with this evaluation without wasting any time, we have introduced a reserve in the Commission's staff costs.
We are sure that the Commission has as much interest as Parliament does in ensuring that the Member States fully apply paragraph 44 in the area of shared management.
I am therefore certain that we will reach an agreement on the reserve.
The second point is transparency.
We believe that the more detailed budgetary expenditure is, the simpler it will be for the competent budgetary authority to monitor its implementation.
We have therefore asked for the creation of new budgetary lines in areas of spending that are very sensitive for Parliament, such as agencies, rural development and other categories such as external action, with a view to, I repeat, a very clear commitment from Parliament and from the Committee on Budgetary Control, which was to contribute to maximum transparency, which is what public opinion demands of us.
<D>
Mr President, the directive we are dealing with today must above all be seen as a complement to the cooperation that has been in existence for three decades between the Member States and their social security systems.
Today, in my country, Luxembourg, more than 30% of healthcare is already provided outside its borders and, moreover, the case of Mr Bowis, to whom I wish a full recovery, is a perfect example of the correct use of the existing regulation, as he was admitted to hospital in Brussels as an emergency case.
He has been well cared for and, for a British citizen, there is no problem about reimbursements.
What, therefore, does this directive need to improve?
It must firstly improve the information given to citizens: information on the services offered, information on the centres of excellence which Mrs Roth-Behrendt has explained so well and, above all, information on the quality of care.
I believe that many member countries, including my own, have to make progress on quality criteria and on quality of care information.
In addition, of course, if I am abroad and things go wrong, I need to have a place that I can turn to.
All that is well regulated in the current text, but we think there are three things that have to improve.
Firstly, we believe that a system of prior authorisation for hospital care has a twin advantage: firstly, it is a big advantage for European citizens because they will know exactly when they will be reimbursed and the care will be also pre-financed.
Moreover, this allows the planning of major hospital infrastructures, since a good health system will not be created by the invisible hand of the market.
It has to be planned.
The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance's second demand concerns a twin legal basis, because we do not want healthcare to be considered as a market.
It must be very clear that the system is organised, above all by the Member States.
The third point relates to rare diseases: we want specific legislation because this is too important, and we would be deluding Europe's citizens if we were to say 'go and look somewhere in Europe, and it will be taken care of'.
We want specific legislation.
Thus we do not want a Bolkenstein II, we want a text that gives legal certainty and that serves the majority of Europe's citizens.
<D>
As a global player, the European Union should keep in view not just the good of its citizens, but should also not forget to maintain a world perspective.
For this reason, decisions made by Members of the European Parliament should be based on a reality which is more than just European.
Voting on the resolution on implementation of the recommendations of Justice Goldstone's report, before the report has been adopted by the UN, is a mistake.
Leaving aside the fact that there was not enough time to debate the report, we were not given a presentation of the report which included comprehensive coverage of the opposing arguments.
In a situation in which the Member States of the European Union are not showing the will to take consistent action on Israel and Palestine, adoption by the European Parliament of any kind of resolution is not helpful to the peace process in the Middle East.
For these reasons, I abstained from voting on the resolution of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), and voted against the joint resolution put forward by the other parties.
I have particular reservations concerning items J and 10 of the joint resolution, which, while they underline the tragic situation of the residents of the Gaza Strip, do not explain that this is a direct result of the rule of Hamas - a group considered by the international community to be a terrorist organisation.
Furthermore, I cannot agree with items 2 and 4 of the joint resolution, which call for implementation of the Goldstone recommendations, while not all of them are legitimate.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - The Commission fully supports the analysis made by the honourable Member in his oral question.
We are the leader in green technology and we need to maintain and reinforce this position.
This will also back the position of the EU in its leading role in the international fora for combating climate change.
With the seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development, the European Union is well equipped - and Parliament played its full role in its outcome - to mobilise EU R&D funds in support of the development of new green technologies.
The Commission is putting a lot of effort into making the most of FP7.
Two of the joint technology initiatives adopted so far are fully dedicated to green technologies: 'Clean Sky', with a European contribution of EUR 800 million; and 'hydrogen and fuel cells', with a contribution of EUR 450 million from the European Community.
With the European Strategic Energy Technology (SET) Plan, we are strongly endorsed by Parliament and the Council.
The Commission has initiated a process that will enhance the effectiveness of Research & Development spending in energy research.
The SET Plan is committed to green technologies.
It calls for the implementation of six new priority European industrial initiatives (industry-led programmes: wind, solar, CCS, grids, bioenergy and sustainable fission) and the establishment of the European Energy Research Alliance (research-led programmes).
The FP7 Energy Community Programme is the main instrument available in the short term to support the implementation of these actions.
But more than EU effort alone is certainly needed.
Therefore, the Community Programme should be used to catalyse actions of Member States and, of course, of the private sector.
This requires a shift in the approach: rather than just cofinancing projects, steering and enabling the deployment of a joint effort through joint programming is truly needed.
Analysing the whole set of work programmes from the first three years of implementation of FP7, the Commission estimates that 37% of the topics supported by R&D funding are for green technology.
Forty per cent of the budget committed after the 2007 calls, under the 'Cooperation' Specific Programmes, also support green technology R&D.
In order to be able to monitor the contribution of FP7 to sustainable development, in general, and to green technology, in particular, the Commission is setting in place a monitoring system that should be operational in the first semester of next year.
In its Communication 'From financial crisis to recovery: A European framework for action', adopted on 29 October this year, the Commission also emphasises the role of R&D investment and education as well as enhancing European competitiveness by continuing to green our economy.
In more general terms, it should be noted that, in addition to FP7 funds and activities, there is a wide range of policy initiatives and supporting programmes related to environmental technologies in the EU like the Environmental Technologies Action Plan, the Competitiveness and Innovation Plan and more recently, the Lead Market Initiative and Action Plan on sustainable production and consumption.
The Commission hopes that, with this element of response, the honourable Member will be convinced that we are fully engaged in harnessing FP7 funds to really greening our research and our economies.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the European Parliament and, in particular, the rapporteur, Mrs Bowles, for its very constructive report on a coordinated strategy to improve the fight against fiscal fraud.
In May 2006, the Commission presented a communication aimed at launching a broad debate on the different elements to be taken into account in an anti-fraud strategy in the Community.
I am pleased that the European Parliament recognises and supports the initiatives taken and the approach chosen by the Commission in its communication.
Equally, I am pleased to see that the European Parliament invites the Commission to submit further proposals.
The report is a very useful and comprehensive contribution to the ongoing discussion about the fight against fiscal fraud.
The Commission fully agrees that fraud is not a problem that can be combated successfully at national level alone.
The Commission will take account of the numerous comments and suggestions made by the European Parliament in the context of its work on the current and forthcoming legislative proposals for conventional measures to combat tax fraud.
As far as actions foreseen in 2008 are concerned, I can confirm that the Commission is planning to present three sets of legislative proposals - one in October, the second in November and the third in December 2008.
Those sets of measures include improved procedures for registration and de-registration of persons liable for VAT in order to ensure the swift detection and de-registration of fake taxable persons and to give more security to honest business.
The legislative proposals will also cover traders' joint and several liability, the creation of a European network (EUROFISC) aimed at improving cooperation in order to detect fraudsters at an early stage, fixing conditions for VAT exemption at importation, mutual assistance in recovery, automated access to data, confirmation of the name and address of taxpayers in the VAT Information Exchange System database and shared responsibility for the protection of all Member States' revenues.
By October, the Commission will present a communication setting out the coherence of the approach it will present, together with a timetable for further actions.
The communication will also address issues relating to a long-term approach, notably the necessity to examine the better use of modern technologies, which has also been underlined in your report.
The Commission is still open to examining alternative systems to the current VAT system, provided that certain conditions are met.
The report mentions, in this context, a reverse-charge mechanism and the taxation of intra-Community supplies.
The Commission has offered both of these radical options for consideration to the ECOFIN Council, but so far Member States have not shown the political will to take such far-reaching measures.
Regarding direct taxes, the Commission is working on the review of the Savings Taxation Directive, and intends to present the report on the operation of the Directive before the end of September, as requested by the ECOFIN Council of 14 May 2008.
During the review process, we have been carefully analysing the current scope of the Directive and the need for amendments in order to enhance its efficiency.
The report will be followed by a proposal for such amendments to the Savings Taxation Directive that prove necessary and appropriate.
The Commission has also carefully taken note of the ECOFIN Council conclusions of the same date, emphasising the importance of promoting the principles of good governance in the tax area - that is transparency, exchange of information and fair tax competition - and the inclusion of related provisions in agreements with third countries and third country groupings.
Thanks to close cooperation with the Member States in the Anti-Tax Fraud Strategy expert group of the Commission, the idea of an anti-fraud strategy at EU level is taking concrete form.
The announced measures will be a big step forward, even if further efforts will have to be made.
Concerning your discussion on tax competition, you will know that we have been working in the Code of Conduct Group on abolishing harmful business tax regimes in the EU.
All in all, the Code of Conduct Group assessed over 400 measures by the present 27 Member States and their dependencies and overseas territories, of which over a hundred were considered harmful.
Almost all of those hundred have already been abolished and the remainder are set to be abolished, subject to the transitional arrangements.
The work conducted under the Code has been successful.
It has led to the dismantling of almost all harmful tax measures in the Member States and their dependent or associated territories.
In conclusion, I would like to thank the European Parliament for its constructive contribution to the debate on the coordinated strategy to improve the fight against fiscal fraud.

Madam President, Euro-Atlantic economic relations are exceptionally important to both sides.
Any commercial disputes should be settled by seeking transparent, balanced solutions.
In this case, the desired objective is to secure a fair hearing for both sides, and a balanced approach to state aid for the aircraft industry.
This financial aid is particularly important for promoting research, innovation and environmental management, and for improving the safety and efficiency of air transport.
The unilateral withdrawal of the United States from the bilateral agreement of 1992 is cause for concern, since European state aid is fully in accordance with the letter and spirit of that agreement.
The European side is justified in considering the financial resources invested in Airbus to be limited in extent, returnable and without competitive impact, in contrast with the prohibited and actionable non-returnable US subsidies.
As you know, the Union has made substantial efforts to achieve a bona fide settlement of the matter on the basis of negotiation.
However, it has not yet met with a response.
The European Commission is therefore called upon to maintain a robust negotiating stance for a long-term settlement of the matter, under terms of legitimate, balanced competition.
The US demand for an end to subsidies to Airbus, as a condition for holding negotiations, falls outside an acceptable framework for settling the dispute.
<D>
(HU) Békesség Istentől!
Pace vouǎ!
Boží pokoj s Vami!
Peace to you from God!
In our multilingual Europe I wanted to wish you peace in Hungarian, Romanian, Slovak and English.
I was able to do this in the European Parliament, but under Slovak legislation, this would have been risky without violating the national language law.
In one EU Member State, people can have a fine imposed on them for speaking languages other than the official language, which includes using one of Europe's official languages, Hungarian.
This is a downright scandal and disgrace.
Take a look at the map of Slovakia I have here in front of me.
Thanks to the Schengen Agreement, the border dividing Slovakia from Hungary has been dismantled, just like the Iron Curtain.
However, the post-Communist chauvinist Slovak Government is now putting up new walls between people, linguistic barriers.
We would like to thank President Jerzy Buzek for his mission to Slovakia aimed at resolving the issue.
On this matter of public interest, the European Parliament should not adopt an ill-informed, convenient stance of non-intervention, but should enforce its own regulations and requirements which it supports in the area of human, minority and linguistic rights.
<D>
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs HennisPlasschaert, on her willingness to enter into dialogue and negotiation on this report.
I would remind you that asylum is a moral duty for the more fortunate countries.
We must not forget that, despite the serious economic circumstances that we are experiencing now, solidarity is an essential element that must govern our policies on asylum and immigration; solidarity with those who, with good reason, ask for our protection, and solidarity with those of our Community partners who, through their geographical circumstances and their size, are faced with the greatest migratory pressures.
In this sphere, the 'asylum package' is an instrument that is both necessary and crucial for the future development of immigration policies in the European Union.
However, I would like to point out that measures as important as those that we are dealing with today require more time for reflection and consideration; the tight margin for manoeuvre that we have had as a result of the deadlines imposed is totally inadequate.
The proposal contains several aspects that will certainly need to be reviewed in the near future.
I am referring to the situation of asylum seekers, the cases in which they may be detained, the fundamental difference between the concepts of 'custody' and 'detention', the facilities in which they may be detained, the formulation of exceptions to transferral, the existence of exceptions to the general principle establishing which country is responsible for considering the application, the specific details of who forms part of the 'nuclear family', and the assistance that ought to be given to Member States having to deal with a greater weight of applications.
Despite these questions and in view of the speed with which we have worked, we can say that, in general, a balanced report has been adopted.
This is a balanced package which reflects the majority of my political group's concerns, particularly those aimed at guaranteeing the rights of people seeking international protection and those designed to support those Member States that have greater numbers of international applications.
I would like to conclude by reminding you that the right to effective legal protection is a fundamental right enshrined in European constitutions and, specifically, in Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
The judiciary ought therefore to be the highest guarantor of the individual rights of people seeking international protection; to achieve this, it will be necessary that applicants who might require it are provided with legal assistance.
Mr President, I will end by urging the need for the European Asylum Support Office and the aid that may be granted through the European Refugee Fund.
<D>
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my support for Mrs Buitenweg's work.
As I understand it, what was supposed to be a compromise will not perhaps be a compromise at all, but that is not important.
The important thing is that we manage to come to a decision.
If anything, on some points my concerns are the opposite of Mr Mauro's.
Religious freedom?
Of course, 100%.
Freedom for religious educational institutions?
Of course, 100%.
No religion can ever, under any circumstances, be a reason, an excuse, or cover for carrying out any kind of discrimination.
There can be no prospect of tolerating exceptions whereby a church or religious institution can discriminate against teachers or students whose behaviour does not conform to a given faith, because of the risk of intrusion by the ethical state and the many religions that can lay claim to the same legitimacy.
That is not the way forward.
After all, our treaties and the European Union already, unfortunately, extend more protection than needed to the national states with their lengthy lists of exceptions to fundamental rights and freedoms.
Let us not add further exceptions to those that already exist.
<D>
(MT) Yes, this is indeed an historic moment, not only because the Irish have accepted the Treaty with a strong vote in favour, but because today Poland has declared it will ratify the Treaty.
This treaty has come a very long way.
I have only been here for five years, yet there are delegates here who have been working towards this historic moment for a long time.
Amongst them is a colleague of mine, Méndez de Vigo.
This momentous occasion will now place greater responsibilities on our shoulders, as politicians, and this also goes for the President of the Czech Republic.
His personal opinion does count; however, one cannot hold a whole country, as well as the whole of the European Union, hostage because of a personal political opinion.
As politicians, we have to shoulder huge responsibilities.
We have to provide answers and we have to answer only to the citizens of the European Union, because ultimately we are representing them.
Europe is facing tough challenges on issues such as the financial crisis, climate change, immigration problems, and the creation of more jobs in Europe.
For this reason, the opinion of the President of the Czech Republic cannot hold Europe back from working to achieve the standards we have set.
I agree with the previous speaker who said that the Commission needs to be appointed.
We have a President and therefore I do not see why we should wait for the ruling of the Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic before a Commission is established.
A great deal of work needs to be done and the Commission needs to get down to business immediately in order to guarantee that this work is carried out.
<D>
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, first of all I would like to congratulate Ms Gomes on this serious, politically very important report.
China is a global player in the contemporary world, and we would like to see China as a real partner of the European Union in the process of globalisation.
China should play an important role in the new world order and we praise the peaceful role played by China in Africa.
At the same time, China must take her responsibilities in the area of human rights and development.
In particular, China should use its influence to curb the nastiest of its friends, including the Government of Sudan.
Fortunately, China has ceased to resist the deployment of United Nations peacekeepers in Darfur and is sending some of its own military engineers to join the force.
On the negative side, China has still sent arms to dictatorial regimes in Africa.
Just this week, Zambia, Mozambique, South Africa and Tanzania blocked attempts by a Chinese vessel to deliver a massive shipment of ammunition, mortars and other lethal armaments to President Mugabe in Zimbabwe.
These weapons could play an anti-democratic, even deadly role, in the hands of the Mugabe regime.
In this report, the European Parliament calls on China to be on the side of African societies, democracy and human rights in Africa.
<D>
It is excellent that the Europe 2020 strategy should take account of young people.
It does not, however, go far enough.
The content is limited and pessimistic.
There are not enough concrete objectives and more of them are needed.
The figures for youth unemployment are alarming.
It is more than double than what it is in other unemployment categories.
Almost half of young people are unemployed in Latvia and Spain.
The longer people remain unemployed, the greater the risk, not just of poverty, but of exclusion.
Young people with just a little work experience are in a worse off position in the labour market, especially when it comes to staff cuts.
Predictions suggest that there will be a shortage of workers.
We cannot take it for granted, however, that the young people who are unemployed now will be able to meet this future need for workers.
It is not necessarily such a straightforward procedure to integrate long-term unemployed young people back into society.
We need concrete measures.
The young need jobs, not promises.
It is very important that we take responsibility for the future, and that children and young people remain at the core of all our plans.
<D>
Madam President, I would like to thank and commend the action taken by Commissioner Michel.
We have heard today that Cyclone Nargis has brought devastation to two and a half million Burmese people and, as the Commissioner said, the situation has been exacerbated by the regime's intransigence in denying foreign aid, so that only a quarter of those in need of urgent help have actually received it.
This is unbelievable and a heartbreaking denial of the Burmese people's most basic human right.
But it is also verging on criminal negligence.
Recently we have heard about some limited flexibility by the junta but I urge the Commission and Council to exercise caution towards this softening, because this is the regime that ruthlessly repressed its own pro-democracy movement.
I would stress that it is vital to keep up the pressure on the junta so that all UN agencies with the experience and logistical know-how to deal with the situation are allowed in.
I am especially concerned that, as the Commissioner stressed, it is the children who are suffering the most.
Accordingly UNICEF needs to be allowed in, to alleviate the threat of disease and malnutrition.
Finally, I call on those who have influence with Burma, namely the neighbours and EU partners - India, China and the ASEAN countries - to encourage the junta to accept relief from others.
I also call on the Commission and others to take steps to make it clear to the junta that democracy and engagement with the outside world are the only viable ways out of the crisis.
I hope that Commissioner Michel will provide an answer to the questions 'Where do we go from here?' and 'How do we move forward?'
<D>
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (SV) Madam President, I hope that many of our citizens are following this debate and becoming involved before the vote as it involves such major changes, especially regarding internet services.
The European United Left has three main areas that we would like particularly to highlight:
Firstly, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left is against the proposal to establish a new European authority in this area.
It will be more expensive and more complicated.
It is unnecessary to set up yet another European authority.
Secondly, greater emphasis must be placed on geographical differences and different infrastructure when it comes to electronic services.
We must emphasise that access for consumers must be equal so that no more gulfs are built into our societies.
There must not be any differences in access to electronic services between those who live in cities and regions with a strong economy and those who live in regions with a weak economy and sparsely populated areas.
When it is not society or the state but private players who are to take over such important investments in infrastructure, there is a clear risk that not all citizens will have the same access at the same cost.
Thirdly, the GUE/NGL Group reacts against the major influence exerted by different industrial lobby groups.
The telecom package should not affect copyright, but the lobbyists have nevertheless gained a hearing especially for this in the proposal.
The proposals of the lobby groups which have been accepted by all groups apart from the European United Left - which was the only group to vote against in the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection - open up opportunities for controlling downloads and free access, for example to websites such as MySpace and YouTube.
The amendments came in late through the back door and without there having been any great debate among the citizens over these major changes.
In Sweden, for example, we have had a wide-ranging debate about file sharing.
I am working against the decision to prohibit file sharing at national level and am doing so at EU level too.
The risk of now taking a decision at EU level is greater than that of national decisions as the lobby groups have had a major influence and effect in the EU system and because many citizens lack sufficient information when we are debating these issues at EU level.
I hope that there will be a powerful surge of opinion from citizens to guarantee freedom of speech and access to internet services.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, in my view, the inclusion of aviation activities in the scheme for emission allowance trading is a step towards meeting the conditions of the Kyoto Protocol, that is correct.
However, may I recall what Mr Sarkozy has just said.
He said that Europe must demand reciprocity, and there is none, or far too little, of that here.
Emission trading should not begin before 2012 at the earliest.
As is the case for small cars, exemptions must be in place for small aircraft under 20 tonnes in order to avoid any disproportionality.
A jumbo jet is not the same as a Cessna!
Many points in the report by the Committee on the Environment simply go too far and leave European businesses no room to manoeuvre and no time to implement the measures.
There is massive discord here.
Recalling again the words of the French President, we must think very hard, once more, about how we structure this emission trading scheme.
<D>
(NL) Mr President, my fellow member, Mrs Mathieu, suggested in her report that, for the time being, we refuse to grant discharge to the European Police College in respect of the implementation of its budget for the financial year 2008.
Naturally, my group, the delegation of the Dutch Freedom Party (PVV), thought that that approach was quite right.
To be precise, the dossier on the Police College reads from beginning to end like a Hercule Poirot whodunit.
Poor management, an accounting system vulnerable to fraud, many financial irregularities and, in particular, 'creative' budgetary spending, unauthorised use of funds, and the list goes on.
In fact, the situation was so bad that, in the end, OLAF, the European Anti-Fraud Office, was forced to step in.
It is a positive thing that an investigation is under way and that action is being taken against fraud.
However, would it not have been better if we had prevented the fraud right from the start?
How could this have been allowed to happen?
Why were the controls in place so obviously inadequate?
Again, we have a situation where our citizens can only look on and shake their heads.
On behalf of Dutch citizens, we explicitly request that you put an end to this entire European police puppet show as soon as possible and simply leave real police work to the Hercule Poirots of individual Member States.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work on this politically very important issue.
The Maritime Transport Strategy until 2018 has been very much used in preparing the Commission's Europe 2020 strategy, and the process for a new White Paper on Transport is on its way.
We can see that this transport strategy is at the forefront of major strategic developments in Europe.
Shipping is one of Europe's strengths, and it is only natural that we should capitalise on what we have built in the past, but it is important to also look into the future.
Our main aim is to ensure and further increase the long-term sustainability and performance of European shipping.
This means efficient, safe, secure and environmentally friendly maritime transport services.
Maritime transport provides for high-quality jobs in Europe and fuels research and European industrial innovation.
We also have ambitious environmental goals, and the Commission has always emphasised the need for global solutions, especially on the reduction of greenhouse gases.
The main work on the strategy was carried out before the economic crisis.
In view of the economic downturn, the strategy is still valid.
In this context, an emphasis must lie on the maintenance and improvement of the international order.
We are faced with threats like protectionism, unfair competition, substandard shipping or piracy.
We must find better responses to these issues, namely through dialogue with major trading partners.
I welcome the conclusions reached by the Committee on Transport and Tourism and the report presented and can assure you that many of the issues are already being addressed by the Commission in various activities to implement the strategy, such as the proposal on reporting formalities for ships, an important element of the Common maritime transport space without barriers.
The Commission services have also started working on a Social Agenda for maritime transport as well as on the EU e-Maritime initiative, both of which the Commission intends to present in 2011.
I would also like to answer the point on State aid guidelines for shipping in 2010.
On the one hand, the 2004 guidelines will not 'expire' in 2011, even if the Commission said that they 'will be reviewed within seven years'.
On the other hand, the current crisis, with its severe consequences for shipping, calls for a very cautious approach.
With regard to the specific measures, we are currently preparing a detailed roadmap for implementation of this strategy, which we plan to publish this summer.
<D>
(RO) There are certain speakers in this Parliament who, regardless of the topic being discussed, talk on the same subject, not always in an appropriate manner.
The first priority during the European Council meeting must obviously be to find a solution so that the Czech Republic can finalise the procedures for ratifying the Treaty of Lisbon.
However, this solution must be a fair one for all the other Member States.
At the same time, we must not forget the current economic crisis which we are still facing and which we must also find immediate solutions for.
The economic and financial crisis, along with the special financial measures adopted last year, have destabilised in an alarming way the public finances of the majority of the European Union's Member States.
So far the Commission has 17 of the 27 Member States in its sights for having an excessive deficit, with estimates showing that another three Member States will soon be in the same situation.
Regardless of their economic power, Member States have exceeded the figures committed to as the crisis has caused a sharp drop in budget revenue and growth beyond the public expenditure planned for.
There are actually clear conditions for an economic recovery in the near future, which is why we can initiate the discussions on reducing the financial incentives in certain areas.
However, we need to take into account the specific situation of each Member State separately and the European institutions must acknowledge that we are not yet at the point where public support can be waived completely for all economic sectors.
Member States must agree on continuing the recovery strategy and on suitable instruments for supporting this, including stepping up structural reforms which may, in the medium term, reduce the fiscal deficit and naturally contribute to economic recovery.
If the post-recovery period is not managed properly by Member States, it may destabilise the European Union's internal market.
Therefore, the decision in favour and permission to continue providing public support must be made based on the specific conditions from one state to the next.
<D>
Mr President, I would very much like to address myself to a representative of the Council as well, but the Council did not decide to send anyone to this debate.
I think that this is a pity, and that it is a bad habit.
And I think that the President should react to this situation.
Returning to the subject of neighbourhood, we must admit, we must be aware, that the countries which surround the European Union are changing very dynamically.
Therefore, we need changes in neighbourhood policy.
The Union for the Mediterranean is our answer to the needs of the south, and the Black Sea Synergy answers the challenge which intensified with the last enlargement of the European Union.
The Eastern Partnership is a timely answer to the expectations of our European neighbours to the east.
In order to achieve the objectives which we have set in recent years for neighbourhood policy, citizens of neighbouring countries must feel a real political and economic rapprochement with the EU.
This is why such importance is attached to establishing a deep free trade area and to rapid action to reduce visa fees, with the proposal of visa liberalisation for a significant part of these countries as the ultimate goal.
Inclusion of energy in the most important objectives of neighbourhood policy should be our common goal, our mutual interest, and this includes engagement of our money in the modernisation of independent energy transfer networks, especially in the east and the south.
Only in this way will we achieve political rapprochement with Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova, Armenia and, ultimately, with Azerbaijan, and in the future - also maintaining appropriate balance - with the five republics of Central Asia.
When we talk about the eastern aspect of neighbourhood, we inevitably come to the problem of Russia and our partnership with this country.
Today, as we stand at the threshold of negotiations over a new agreement, we can, however, say only one thing - Russia is a challenge for security in our common neighbourhood.
It is very difficult to see Russia as a partner in this area.
Here, we come to the fundamental political problem of expansion of the EU to the east.
The neighbourhood process does not, of course, replace accession, but it cannot be separated from the perspective of membership in the case of European countries.
Without that perspective, our efforts will be significantly impaired.
Taking this opportunity, I would like to give many thanks to all the coordinators of foreign affairs of the political groups, the co-rapporteurs, and also the Secretariat of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, without whose help it would not have been possible to prepare a report which today enjoys broad support, as can be seen by the very small number of amendments submitted in the plenary session.
This will significantly facilitate voting tomorrow.
<D>
- Madam President, it was the great philosopher, Whitney Houston, who once said: 'I believe that children are our future.
Teach them well and let them lead the way.
Show them all the beauty they possess inside.'
What is interesting about this report is that for the first time we are, in many ways, looking at the key for future development.
We are notably looking for child development and child education, and not only female child education - if you teach the woman, you teach the family - but also primary education.
There is a simple flaw in our thinking on primary education: we always seem to think that the state has the solution.
I urge all my colleagues in this House to look at the solutions that have been highlighted by the E. G. West Centre at the University of Newcastle, which looks at private education for the poor.
Where the state has failed to provide education for poor children, parents themselves have come together, finance non-state education and, therefore, are also able to subsidise the non-working poor.
I would urge everyone to look beyond the state for solutions to help the very poorest in our society.
<D>
(ES) Mr President, I would like to call the attention of this House to the fact that 27 September was the thirtieth World Tourism Day, held under the slogan 'Tourism - Celebrating Diversity', at a time when we are all hoping for the rapid entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, which incorporates tourism as a new sphere of action for the European Union.
One of the sector's challenges is to improve the range of tourism experiences on offer for the whole world without discrimination.
As pointed out by the Montreal Declaration, access to tourist leisure for the whole world necessarily means being involved in the struggle against inequality and the exclusion of the culturally different, those of limited means or abilities, or those who live in developing countries.
Parliament has translated this ambition into a pilot project on social tourism which the Commission will develop this year.
Another reason for its actions is that social tourism helps the employment rate by combating seasonality - one of the sector's major problems - and creates greater equality, more jobs and jobs which last for longer.
Ladies and gentlemen, that is our objective.
<D>
Every child has a right to education.
The integration of migrants, whether residing legally or illegally, is a priority for us socialists.
We do not accept the hierarchy that the parliamentary right wishes to create amongst migrants.
This is why I abstained from the vote on Mr Takkula's excellent report on educating the children of migrants.
I did so because, as it is an own-initiative report, it was not possible for us to take separate votes to call for the removal of paragraphs 5, 8 and 16, which I find absolutely unsatisfactory.
It is by educating the children of migrants that we will make an important contribution to the integration of all, irrespective of their status.
It is by introducing favourable socioeconomic conditions that we will be able to give greater assistance to migrants, whether they reside legally in Europe, or whether they are destined to be granted legal residence or ultimately sent back to their own country.
We should not create a status for these children whereby they are not educated and are ghettoised merely because their parents are residing illegally.
That is simply contrary to the international conventions.
<D>
(PL) Madam President, the majority of us can take free access to water for granted.
We use large amounts of water every day.
It is worth remembering, however, that according to estimates of the World Health Organisation, one sixth of the Earth's population, that is to say, over one billion people, do not have access to water which meets basic, minimal standards of cleanliness.
This means that in the civilisation of the 21st century, millions of people are suffering thirst and dying as a result of diseases caused by drinking contaminated water.
Recently I was in Lagos, the largest city in Africa, where barely 1% of the people have access to running water.
Statistics of this type are horrifying, but nonetheless the problem of water does not make the front pages of newspapers, does not excite the general interest of the media, and is not the subject of discussions and disputes, as is the case, for example, with AIDS, the fight against malaria or global warming.
This surely results from the fact that the problem concerns only 2% of Europeans, whereas it concerns 27% of people in Africa.
It is estimated that in Africa alone, more people die each year from diseases caused by drinking dirty water than from AIDS and malaria put together.
It can, therefore, be said that lack of access to drinking water does not kill in a spectacular way likely to be given prominence in the media, and does not generate as broad interest as a disaster like an earthquake, a tsunami, flooding or armed conflicts.
As Mr Ribeiro e Castro has already said, however, the facts are that, on average, every day 6 000 children die from diseases caused by a lack of water.
This means that one child dies every 15 seconds.
Can you imagine the reaction of the world, the response, the degree of mobilisation and determination, if this were happening in Europe, and not in Sub-Saharan Africa or Asia?
Consequently, the problem of access to water is not only a problem for developing countries, but also for developed countries.
Universal access to drinking water is an essential condition for the development of countries and the fight against poverty.
Unless this need is met, there is no point in talking about improving healthcare or developing education.
Unless water for the needs of farming or simple industry can be guaranteed, whole societies are condemned to a battle for daily existence.
This leads to armed conflicts, migration and destabilisation.
In other words, it hinders development and increases developmental inequalities.
Politicians will also be present at the Forum we are debating.
They will discuss matters of current importance.
One of these matters is the situation in Darfur, where President al-Bashir is expelling organisations which, among other things, have been helping to ensure that the people of Darfur have access to water.
There will therefore be an opportunity to persuade, amongst others, President al-Bashir, to allow international organisations to supply water to the people of Darfur.
<D>
rapporteur. - (SV) Mr President, the Community Code on Visas seeks to harmonise and clarify the visa procedure throughout the Schengen area.
Everyone applying for a visa should be treated equally, irrespective of the Schengen consulate he or she turns to.
Good administrative practice and a dignified reception should be guaranteed and the entry of genuine travellers should be facilitated.
Rules concerning the introduction of the requirement for holders of visas to give their fingerprints and the option of relocating the reception and processing of visa applicants were already approved on a previous occasion in a separate report tabled by Baroness Ludford.
These rules have been included in the Community Code as an integral part of this Code.
Thank you, Sarah, for your close cooperation.
(SV) This proposed regulation should be established by means of the codecision procedure between Parliament and the Council.
After work that has taken nearly three years and that has required intensive negotiations with the Council, I am pleased, as rapporteur, to now be able to table a compromise proposal, which the Council has approved and which I hope will win the approval of Parliament.
I would like to say a special thank you to the shadow rapporteurs Mrs Klamt, Mr Cashman, Mrs Ždanoka and Mrs Kaufmann for their very constructive cooperation and strong support in the negotiations.
Without the support of a unanimous committee, Parliament would not have achieved such a good result in the negotiations.
I would also like to extend my thanks to the Commission, which tabled a sound initial proposal that was gratifying to develop further.
My thanks also go to the French and Czech Presidencies, both of which demonstrated the will to recognise the problems that Parliament wished to address and the ability to meet Parliament half way.
With the Commission's proposal as a starting point, all of the compromises represented improvements on the current situation and it proved possible to resolve the most difficult issues with the French Presidency even before Christmas.
Of course, the whole preparation and negotiation process would never have succeeded without the splendid work carried out by my own able staff and that of my colleagues, the committee secretariat and the officials from the political groups.
I would like to extend a particularly warm thank you to them.
The three most important results that we have achieved are: firstly, that a multiple-entry visa not only can, but must, be issued when certain agreed criteria are met; secondly, that the Member States have undertaken to enter into an agreement to represent each other, so that no one applying for a visa need make disproportionately difficult journeys in order to reach a competent Schengen consulate; and, thirdly, that a common website is to be set up to provide a unified picture of the Schengen area and to provide information regarding the rules applying to the granting of visas.
The fact that the visa fee could not be reduced from EUR 60 to EUR 35 is disappointing.
However, this disappointment is assuaged by the fact, for example, that children under the age of six and persons under the age of 25 representing organisations in seminars, sports activities or cultural events will receive their visa free of charge.
I would like to finish by saying that this reform introduces two instruments that will be very important factors in the uniform application of the Schengen rules actually becoming a reality, namely the visa information system, which is a database covering all of the Schengen countries and which will provide the consulates with information in real time on who has applied for a visa, who has been granted a visa, who has had his or her application for a visa rejected and which visas have been withdrawn, and renewed local institutional cooperation between the Schengen consulates in different countries.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, Madam Vice-President, citizens' scepticism about the European Union can be felt very strongly nowadays, and there is a reason for that.
It is due to the policies which have been pursued over recent years and the way in which they have been conveyed to citizens.
For that reason, it is extremely important for the European Commission and other EU institutions to gear policy-making far more strongly towards the lives of citizens and to convey the impression and demonstrate to them that the European Union is genuinely doing something for its citizens.
To that end, it is also important - for example, in our analyses of what is needed - to focus more strongly on what we should be doing.
For example, a consumer scoreboard is a very important instrument which must be further expanded so that we can take better account of citizens' concerns and interests in this area.
The second point which is also important in this context is better monitoring of the impacts of EU legislation.
It is not enough simply to assess the economic impacts.
We need clear impact assessments in the social sphere as well, so that we are aware of how the legislation that we are forging is impacting on citizens, and so that we can demonstrate that what we know what we want and what we are doing, and that what we are doing can generate positive outcomes for their lives.
It is also important to grant the same rights to citizens throughout the EU.
I would therefore urge you to work on the further development of class actions and common legal entitlements.
That would send out a very important signal to citizens.
<D>
(RO) Dear Commissioner, dear colleagues, we are well aware of what the Commission reminds us: there is a huge number of Europeans who live in poverty, including extreme poverty.
Those who do not know this should accept the blame for the fact that a rich society, which is based on the principles of justice and solidarity, like ours, operates in such a way that a country of poor Europeans would have more seats in this Parliament than Germany.
Poverty is not an abstraction; it is a way of life affecting women and children in particular.
Women, including employed ones, come across increased risks given the structural salary gap, their concentration in poorly paid, weakly unionized sectors and in the informal economy, given their prevalence among single-parent families.
Poverty is inherited.
The economic poverty of parents favours the cultural poverty of children, by reduced access to education, the political poverty, by low participation in or exclusion from decision-making, the social poverty, by low participation in civic activities and isolation.
It creates deeper inequalities than those derived from the different purchasing power.
Minimum coherence between statements and actions forces us to do more than make citizens aware.
Political decisions are necessary in order to remedy the situation.
In the Union, we cannot speak of a lack of resources, but sometimes of their unfair distribution, of rules perpetuating exclusion.
It is a joint responsibility, including of companies that, for their own interest, should go beyond the stage in which the financing of a foundation for protecting stray dogs in the neighbourhood is the only expression of social responsibilities.
<D>
. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, just this once I do not intend to speak about the report itself - on which I congratulate the rapporteur - but rather on the amendments soon to be put to the vote, and I wish to say that I find the amendments proposed by our UEN colleagues literally scandalous.
(Applause)
By refusing to countenance in the report any consideration of, or reference to, the problems of contraception, the UEN is effectively refusing to recognise that women in the southern hemisphere are entitled to a decent life.
It is more than scandalous, it is irresponsible and hypocritical, when we know that the absence of proper family planning condemns millions of people across the world to unnecessary suffering, illness and death - the hardest hit being women and the children that they bring into the world, all too often against their own wishes.
The amendments proposed by the PPE-DE Group are no less regrettable.
They merely formulate the ideas differently, particularly by refusing to consider recognition of a woman's right to control her own fertility.
In the great majority of developing countries, women and girls - even young girls - continue to suffer significant forms of discrimination and quite intolerable violence.
Anyone rejecting the view that each individual woman in those countries should be entitled to full control of her own destiny is obviously refusing to regard these women as the equals of men.
Yet reproductive health should not be such an alarming subject: it simply implies enabling people to experience responsible, satisfying and safe sexuality, and giving women the freedom to choose to have children if and when they want children.
This concept of health depends on women and men being able to choose, on a basis of equality, methods of regulating fertility that are safe, effective, affordable and acceptable.
<D>
Mr President, as has already been mentioned, every year 65 000 people die in Europe from smoking-related illnesses.
The number of victims of passive smoking is also tragically high - about 80 000 European citizens die every year owing to other people's bad habit.
That is why a total ban on smoking in the workplace and other public places should be welcomed.
Our long fight against smoking has not been unsuccessful.
Ten or twenty years ago, it was natural for people to smoke almost everywhere: during meetings and even on buses in some countries.
Now it is almost an aggression to light a cigarette at social events.
The success of the anti-smoking campaign shows us that multinational companies, such as the tobacco companies, are not unbeatable.
If we have clear goals for the environment and health and we can mobilise society, NGOs and politicians - not forgetting good lawyers - then we can reach our goals, step by step.
This report is taking the right steps in the right direction.
We should of course mention that it is smoking we are fighting, not smokers.
<D>
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (DA) Mr President, I should like to briefly state the reasons for my oral amendment, and it actually concerns both Mr Corbett and Mr Leinen, who gave the size of Parliament as an argument for this change.
The present oral amendment, which I am tabling on behalf of my group, is a natural extension of the amendments that were adopted in 2002 when Mr Corbett was rapporteur.
I am therefore closely following his reasoning, which took account of the enlargement of the EU from 15 to 25 countries.
Using the same ratios for an EU now consisting of 27 countries, one arrives at a figure of 3%, which must represent one fifth of these nations, resulting in a lower limit of 22 for the number of members.
I hope that my amendment is seen for what it is, namely a compromise text.
Yesterday's negotiations made a plea for us to seek a compromise, one whose text was fully consistent with the reasoning used by Mr Corbett in 2002.
The oral amendment reads as follows.
I shall read it out in English, as I have only the English version, which was circulated among Members today.
'A political group shall comprise Members elected in at least one fifth of the Member States.
The minimum number of Members required to form a political group shall be 3% of the total number of Members.'
(DA) I would urge my fellow Members to vote in favour of this oral amendment, as it would be a compromise in which we who are opposed to the original proposal indeed remain faithful to Mr Corbett's logic.
(The oral amendment was not accepted.)
<D>
(HU) Mr President, the Commissioner summed up his expectations beautifully in his speech, but the documents available to us do not reflect that.
There is a small, tiny semantic problem: discrimination must not be called the widening of opportunities.
I have been speaking only about the segregation of Roma children for four years.
In addition to this, half our children, several million Roma children, are classified as disabled.
What is this, if not discrimination?
Omitting the topic of segregation when creating the Horizontal Directive is an unforgivable crime.
Commissioner Barrot should be involved in the work too, and Parliament's demands should not be left out either!
We want, in at least four resolutions, a Roma integration package with legislation and a budget, and a group to coordinate the Committees in the interests of implementing any future programmes effectively.
Commissioner Špidla cannot resolve this matter by himself.
Thank you.
<D>
(FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, wanting a knowledge economy is a good thing, but it is not enough.
Growth in direct or ancillary jobs relies on the sustainability of traditional forms of blue-collar work, but these industries are caught in a vice.
With their competitiveness already under threat from the increasing bureaucratic costs in our societies, they are being stifled by the absurd way in which the euro is managed, which generates a competitive additional income for countries that have no serious social or environmental policy whatsoever.
The model is back-to-front.
We are socialist within the EU and liberal outside it, yet what we need is greater protection from the rest of the world and greater freedom within.
The facts make this clear.
The Lisbon Strategy does not work because of the asymmetry in Europe's economies, growing pressure of competition and the hypermobility of the capital markets.
Let us therefore abandon the demotivating myth of a European social strategy that guarantees prosperity for all.
You cannot make a plant grow by pulling on its leaves!
The solutions will come not from Brussels, but from free cooperation and the Member States' own common sense.
It is our roots in the soil of our nations that will give us the intelligence, responsiveness, sense and strength to meet today's challenges.
In this particular case letters to Father Christmas will get us nowhere.
<D>
(NL) Mr President, this is the first time that I have spoken in plenary.
I hope to be able to represent the interests of the Dutch citizens of Europe here both now and in the future.
There was much negotiation before the drafting of this in-depth report by Mr Schmidt.
I am glad that the rapporteur and the other groups have finally reached this compromise.
The Commission proposal seeks to raise the excise tariffs in stages and so reduce the difference between the Member States.
The environmental argument has a role to play, but I believe that the increase in fuel prices is already a sufficiently motivating factor.
Moreover, the Commission uses distortion of competition as an argument for raising the minimum excise rate on diesel for professional use.
I am astonished that fuel tourism is used as an argument for raising the minimum excise on diesel for professional use, as this argument is excessively strong.
Fuel tourism is a marginal phenomenon in the transport industry, with little influence on mutual competitive positions and the functioning of the internal market.
The Commission proposes a sharp increase in the minimum rate, to 380 euro per 1 000 litres.
I believe that such an increase in conjunction with the already extremely high fuel prices will have too great an impact on the consumer's purse and on inflation.
The EP's committee eventually settled on an increase to 359 euro per 1 000 litres by 1 January 2015.
The Netherlands is already over this target.
There is one more thing.
The transport sector is rightly complaining that the steadily increasing excise is driving fuel prices steeply upwards.
The Commission proposal on the harmonisation of diesel excise has no upper limit.
Differences would thus continue to exist.
Parliament believes that the Member States must freeze the excise tariff on diesel at 400 euro per 1 000 litres until 1 January 2015.
Finally, I hope that when the finance ministers make their decision they will give priority to the interests of the consumer as regards purchasing power and limiting inflation.
<D>
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, I too am the shadow on this package and I would pick up on what Mr Díaz de Mera García Consuegra was saying about the moral duty here.
Also, when we are talking about rigorous application, as mentioned by some Members, some of us are more concerned that the application of rules is actually fair and that it does not stop people in need of protection actually getting it.
One of the points about this particular package is how we improve that and make sure that all Member States are operating to the same high standard.
In terms of the reception of asylum seekers recast, we very much welcome the Commission's initial proposal and want to maintain certain parts of it, not least those concerning labour market access and adequate income support, which we voted on earlier today.
I greatly regret that my own country, the UK, is opting out because of those two particular proposals.
That is a real shame in all senses of the word.
Access to health care is, of course, also crucially important, in terms not only of emergencies but also of ongoing health care, particularly for those who have maybe suffered torture and therefore need support for their own mental well-being.
In terms of the Dublin recast as well, we welcome the initial proposal, we support the suspension mechanism and, indeed, will vote to keep the widest possible definition of family reunion.
<D>
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, I spoke at the plenary in June and emphasised the need for Europeans to tackle this crisis together through an effective and impartial mechanism capable of allowing emergency measures to be adopted at Community level.
We European socialists are pleased that the problems in this sector have received a response at Community level and that the proposal includes measures which we Members of Parliament, who have debated them here on various occasions, and the governments of the Member States most affected have been demanding for so long.
We trust, Mr Borg, that the measures which you are proposing will help to highlight two problems which European fleets have been facing for a long time: excessive fuel dependency and the need to improve the marketing of fisheries products.
We agree, as you might expect, with the financing measures, and with some more than others, as for example the temporary cessation of fishing activities and changes to engines and fishing gear; we are also very pleased that the aid is being extended for the first time to shore-based workers, something which socialists have called for on many occasions.
We also welcome your own announcement that other, wider-ranging proposals are in the pipeline such as those intended to improve marketing and also the price-setting mechanism, with a consequent increase in the de minimis regime, which, as you said, depends on the outcome of an economic impact study.
As you are well aware, we in the Party of European Socialists have foregone the opportunity to amend the proposal so that it can be approved unopposed at tomorrow's meeting, as you requested, with a view to its adoption by the Fisheries Council in March next year.
<D>
Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Madam President, Mrs Kósáné Kovács, ladies and gentlemen, I wish first to thank Mrs Kósáné Kovács for her report that contributes to the joint efforts to promote the social inclusion of the Roma.
The Commission shares your analysis, Mrs Kósáné Kovács, as to the main underlying reasons for this exclusion: the social segregation they suffer, the obstacles they face trying to access education, the discrimination that prevents them from fully participating in the world of work, that prevents access to goods and services, and above all - and you have highlighted it very well - the prejudices and stereotypes with which they are saddled.
The Commission also supports the European Parliament's proposals for sustainable solutions, in particular your emphasis on child development from the preschool phase, the development of microcredit to strengthen entrepreneurship, self-employment and the targeted implementation of structural funds.
For the Commission, the implementation of effective, sustainable solutions requires the action of all the key players, including, essentially, the Roma themselves, to develop, implement and monitor the policies that affect them.
In addition, the Commission considers that it would be better to use Community instruments and policies to achieve the inclusion of the Roma, that there must be an exchange of best practice, such as the ACCEDER programme in Spain or the desegregation efforts in Hungary.
To be effective, the policies must be targeted and respect the specific situations of the Roma communities to achieve the goal of social integration.
In the spirit of your report, Mrs Kósáné Kovács, the Commission will continue to support the social inclusion of the Roma by reinforcing the protection of the individual rights of all the Roma, in particular women and children, taking into account the problems of the Roma in the framework of policy coordination at European level, in particular as relates to employment and social inclusion, via a more active implementation of the structural funds and the European Social Fund, and, finally, by reinforcing the institutional capacities of Roma civil society.
I wish to thank you for your report, Mrs Kósáné Kovács.
I can tell you that my colleague, Commissioner Špidla, and I are very aware of these problems.
I would add that our Fundamental Rights Agency is to give us two reports on the situation of the Roma that I hope will allow us to propose and promote what you have just explained to us so well.
Thank you, Mrs Kósáné Kovács, and thanks to Parliament for its support.
<D>
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FI) Mr President, Commissioner, once again it is that time of the year when the Court of Auditors gives a negative opinion on the legality and relevance of the previous year's expenditure.
In the spring it will be time for Parliament to grant discharge in respect of the parties concerned, despite the negative report.
At least that has been the practice in recent years, except for one year when there was an election.
I would like to draw your attention to Diagrams V and VI in the Annex to the Court of Auditors' report, which are for calculating Member States' net contributions.
Member States' tariffs, including those charged on goods shipped to other Member States, have been included under traditional own resources.
This gives a misleading picture of the actual net contribution made by some Member States, particularly the Netherlands and Belgium, especially when the unreasonably large 25% tariff commission is taken into account.
It is also hard to accept a method of calculation, which apparently originates with the Commission, which does not include administrative expenditure in the Union's expenditure in this context.
The audit numbers purely and simply do not tell the whole truth on the use of resources, therefore: they also comprise political elements.
It is a positive sign that the country which has not applied the monitoring and administration system for agricultural expenditure properly is mentioned by name, i.e. Greece.
The examples of the misuse of agricultural payments the President of the Court of Auditors cited in his presentation speech need to be corrected.
The problems were not just about golf clubs, Commissioner Kallas.
A good example of the positive influence the auditors' recommendations has had is the attention given to the remuneration paid to Members' assistants.
The revised rules are plainly far too strict, but better that than permitting neglect.
(Applause)
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, just one year after the declaration of independence, the situation in Kosovo, and in the whole Western Balkans region, is overall stable and under control, in spite of some incidents.
The European Union presence in Kosovo is progressively materialising, taking over from the United Nations.
The EU special representative is residing in Priština, and the EU's Rule of Law Mission (EULEX) is deployed throughout Kosovo and will be fully operational at the end of March.
A stable and multi-ethnic Kosovo is a key priority for the European Union.
The best way for Kosovo to move towards European integration is by creating a democratic and multi-ethnic society, with full respect for the rule of law, cooperating peacefully with its neighbours and contributing to regional and European stability.
This includes extensive measures to safeguard the future of all communities in Kosovo, thereby creating a basis for sustainable economic and political development.
The Commission's progress report of November 2008 was considered by the authorities to be an objective and fair assessment of what was achieved and of the challenges ahead.
The Kosovo authorities have committed themselves to working and cooperating with the Commission in meeting these challenges.
We allocate significant funding to Kosovo under the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (EPA), as part of the overall pledge of EUR 1.2 billion reached at the July 2008 donors' conference.
In 2008, the Instrument for Pre-Accession supported projects worth EUR 185 million in Kosovo, a three-fold increase compared to the previous year.
We will allocate a further EUR 106 million in 2009.
The management of this funding is the exclusive responsibility of our Commission Liaison Office in Priština, which is now fully operational with all relevant control systems in place, and takes over from the European Agency for Reconstruction.
The Commission welcomes the draft resolution being discussed here today in the European Parliament.
It touches on many issues that we agree are of crucial importance, such as the preservation of Kosovo's cultural heritage, the improvement of its public administration capacity, better integration among its communities, the importance of multi-ethnic education, and the plight of Roma families in lead-contaminated refugee camps in the north.
The Commission takes all these issues very seriously.
Perhaps I can say a few words on each of them in turn.
Since 2004, the Commission has financed the reconstruction of religious and cultural heritage sites - its programme with a budget of EUR 10 million - with the close involvement of the Council of Europe.
In 2008 and 2009 funding is continuing, with EUR 2.5 million more for further projects.
We consider this a very important aspect of reconciliation and have supported the establishment of Kosovo's cultural heritage database.
Graveyards could also be included in this debate so as to ensure their proper restoration and preservation.
I would like to express our gratitude to the European Parliament for the additional amount of EUR 3 million, within the 2008 EU budget, for cultural heritage reconstruction in the war-affected areas in the Western Balkans.
The Commission has allocated half of this amount - EUR 1.5 million - to Kosovo, in a joint project with the Ministry of Culture, in the multi-ethnic town of Prizren.
We are grateful for the additional amount under this heading which is also allocated in this year's budget.
Under the 2007 Instrument for Pre-Accession, the Commission is implementing projects to facilitate the return and reintegration of internally displaced people and refugees in Kosovo, for a total of amount of EUR 3.3 million.
We have envisaged further funding -EUR 4 million under the 2008 Instrument for Pre-Accession, and EUR 2 million under the 2009 Instrument for Pre-Accession.
This money will also contribute to improving the local capacity to reintegrate returnees into the local social and economic environment.
Gender equality is high on our agenda as well.
The Commission has provided technical assistance to the Kosovo Gender Equality Agency.
It has also supported the activities of several local NGOs working in the field of gender equality and women's rights through the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights.
As regards public administration capacity, the Commission monitors the implementation of Kosovo's public administration reform strategy and action plan.
We have stressed with the authorities the urgency of adopting the Civil Service Law.
Through our involvement in setting up the regional school for public administration we also cooperate with the Kosovo Institute for Public Administration.
Special attention is paid to the Ministry of Local Government and Administration, with a support project for almost EUR 1 million.
The Commission is making significant efforts to help reform the education system in Kosovo.
Our financial assistance is comprehensive.
It aims at improving both material conditions and the quality of teaching at primary, secondary and tertiary levels and in the vocational sector, as well as strengthening the multicultural aspects as a basic condition for reconciliation.
Following the July donors' conference, a multi-donor trust fund was set up by the World Bank for the broader social sector, including education.
With EUR 5 million, the Commission is among the main contributors to the fund.
Altogether, EU assistance to education in Kosovo, over the period 2006-2010, amounts to EUR 30.5 million.
The opening of a multi-ethnic European university college will receive our support once all local stakeholders reach an agreement to make this effort a sustainable project.
The plight of Roma families in lead-contaminated refugee camps in the north is an issue of serious concern.
The Commission is actively assisting in finding a swift and sustainable solution acceptable to all.
We have repeatedly called on all parties to refrain from politicising the issue, and to act only with the best interests of the Roma families in mind.
Finally, Kosovo also benefits from our multi-beneficiary programmes, covering the Western Balkans and Turkey, which fund the process of civil registration of Roma people.
Our support for Roma in Kosovo also includes education.
Together with the Council of Europe, we support quality education for Roma children, including in their mother tongue.
In my view, all this is very much in line with your proposals.
I thank all honourable Members of this Parliament very much for their attention and look forward to your questions.
<D>
in writing. - (SV) If the EU partnership agreement were to be terminated with immediate effect, that would have serious consequences for several developing countries and for the many people affected.
We cannot therefore simply say 'no' to the agreements which the EU has with other countries on fishing.
However, we take scientific reports showing that the seas are being fished out very seriously indeed.
We therefore want to change the EU's fisheries policy so that it will lead to a recovery in fishing stocks.
This must form part of a major review.
We do not see EU fisheries agreements as a viable means, in the long term, of combating poverty and supporting development.
We therefore want to support sustainable development in those countries for which current fisheries agreements with the EU are a major source of income by making changes to the EU's trade and aid policy and through various forms of partnership.
The vessel owners should be accountable for the costs arising under the agreements from which they themselves draw benefit, and we want to see continued change in that direction.
We therefore voted for Amendment 8, although that change should take place in a wider context.
<D>
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, the decision that we are about to take is a very important one.
The Socialist Group is in favour of postponement for four reasons of principle.
The first is the credibility and the role of our own Parliament.
It is very important to say, from the outset, what Parliament can and cannot do.
What it can and must do is control democratically the accounts of the Council, too, notwithstanding the gentlemen's agreement that has been put in place.
The second reason is interinstitutional equilibrium.
It is important that we do not do something that we cannot do as a Parliament, but it is also very important to say that it is our right to have a view, to have an opinion on the Council's accounts, when these accounts are operational and where these operational accounts must be accounted for.
This is the democratic principle and this is what we are about to do.
So we are not saying we want to do something else.
We are saying we want to do our duty.
The third reason is the respect and the preparation for the Lisbon Treaty.
You know very well, colleagues, that, with the Lisbon Treaty, the common external policy acquires much more depth and much more momentum.
It is a much more important common policy and we cannot from the outset say that Parliament will not have a bearing on that policy at all.
We must have the opportunity now to say what the role of Parliament is.
The last - and probably the most important - point is transparency vis-à-vis the citizens.
Our role as a Parliament is accountability vis-à-vis the citizens.
We cannot, and we must not, say to the citizens that the big common policies, like the external and defence policy, will lie outside the democratic control of our Parliament.
So for those four important reasons of principle, we believe that we must vote in favour of postponement.

on behalf of the IND/DEM group. - (FR) Madam President, let's hear it for Mrs Gomes, but I would also like to ask a general question.
I would like to ask who the Chinese government are trying to kid.
Well, I have an idea: I think that it is trying to kid everyone.
It has made a laughing stock of the European Commission, which I must say was extremely naive and lenient in the textile quotas episode.
It is making a mockery of the rules of international trade - if there still are any - by constantly failing to check whether its exports are manufactured in accordance with the quality and safety standards of importing countries, particularly when it comes to toys, thus proving the absurdity of free trade.
It is making a laughing stock of France by organising anti-French demonstrations in Paris because it was upset by French protests about the mistreatment of the people of Tibet, which it continues to oppress.
It is making a laughing stock of the whole world, because it knows that the world is market-led and that it covets the Chinese market.
Therefore, it does exactly what it wants.
Its domination will be all the more complete since, through political cunning, the Chinese government has managed to outmanoeuvre Europe, Mr Michel, to get to Africa, thus gaining control of our staple commodities.
Who can blame it?
It is only profiting from our weakness, not least of all the stupid and dangerous disengagement of Europe, and France in particular, from a continent which will become increasingly important to us in the 21st century.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, let me start with the next steps, which are more concrete.
Following the Rio meeting, consultations will be held in Geneva next month to collect views on the outcome of Rio and the preparation for the next meeting in New Delhi.
The Commission participates in the advisory group which assists the UN Secretary-General in the preparation of the IGF.
As has been our practice since the World Summit on the Information Society, we will of course inform Members of the outcome of this meeting.
I would now like to answer some of the specific questions raised by MEPs, starting with Ms Trautmann.
We welcome the fact that Ms Trautmann addressed, in her speech at the opening session, the issue of the 'Internet of Things' and the possibility of bringing this up at the IGF next year.
With regard to the second part of Ms Trautmann's speech, regional IGFs have emerged in a number of places, and this appears to be a useful way to focus on questions of internet governance that are of particular importance for a specific region.
The Commission strongly supports this idea.
Moving on to Mr Savi, we could not agree more with his statement, and this is why the Commission is committed to the development of the e-application with the broad programmes and legislation.
To Mr Czarnecki, the Commission is committed to all the initiatives on child protection.
We promoted the item on the IGF agenda and we are about to propose a renewed programme on child protection on the internet.
<D>
Madam President, I would like to come back on what Mr Watson said.
He, too, has played his part.
Though you are not a member of our committee, you have still had an impact on our committee and helped us to reach a compromise.
Of course, the staff who have helped me to reach this agreement have also played an important role.
I can only reiterate what Commissioner Verheugen said.
The Commission has been clear throughout the process, at least with me, that if the Council and Parliament had reached a more far-reaching compromise involving a total ban, the Commission would have accepted it.
There has been no lack of clarity between the Commission and me in relation to this issue.
I would just like to illustrate this chemical to you all.
If I were to open a single one-kilo pot here and now, spread it over the benches and paint it out, we would, in fact, somewhat exceed the safe limit throughout this exceedingly large chamber.
That is how very toxic this particular chemical is.
I can only conclude this debate by appealing to the Commission to ensure, now, that those Member States which apply for a derogation for professional use have that derogation revoked if these new, stricter rules are regularly broken.
We know, everybody knows, and all the studies show that, if dichloromethane is used correctly in such a way that the health of the workers involved is protected, this substance is both uneconomical and unecological.
If DCM is allowed to behave according to proper market conditions, which is to say if the legislation is complied with, its own uncompetitiveness will very quickly mean that DCM will be completely abandoned to be replaced by the alternatives.
I will take this opportunity to appeal to the Commission to ensure that the regulations are complied with.
If this is done, DCM will phase itself out sufficiently quickly.
<D>
(RO) I partially agree with the rapporteur.
I wish to say that in order to achieve the EU 2020 strategy objectives, we need knowledge and innovation.
We are not talking about purchasing knowledge, but about investing in an education system which is adapted to market requirements.
At the moment, universities in the European Union offer researchers and students less attractive conditions than the colleges in the United States.
One of the main reasons for this is the lack of money.
As was also emphasised by the President of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso, Europeans are competing against each other to attract the best footballers.
However, they are losing their researchers to the Americans.
It is therefore absolutely necessary to revamp Europe's universities so that they can play a decisive role in society and in an economy based on knowledge and innovation.
One solution to assuage the discontent of employers, who believe that university education does not take into account the requirements of the labour market and does not prepare students to face the current climate, is for university programmes to offer students opportunities to carry out practical work placements in SMEs.
<D>
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, I am very pleased to say that the UK is excluded from this regulation because it is not part of the Schengen zone.
However, the British Government has said that it will keep in step with the regulation to ensure that its documents are not perceived as second class.
This implies that it thinks the proposals are first class and then it will be bound by the substance of the regulation anyway.
But, as this report shows, all kinds of issues are raised concerning the authenticity of biometric data and its verification.
What kind of originating documents are used for the initial identification of the applicant, and how can it be sure that they are authentic?
Once a passport has been issued, it is not of much use unless the data on it can be checked against the identity of the holder on some kind of national or centralised identity database.
The report acknowledges that there should be highly secure storage mediums for keeping such information, but we all know from experience in Britain that there is no such thing as a highly secure medium for storing such data.
Personal and highly sensitive information for literally millions of people has been lost or disclosed from government databases over the last few years.
Everyone in the UK knows that their personal information is not safe in the hands of our government.
This report does not speak about the reliability of biometric data itself.
In fact the UK Passport Service's biometrics enrolment trial in 2004 showed a failure rate of 1 in 3 for facial recognition, 1 in 5 for fingerprints and 1 in 20 for iris scans.
Biometric identification is an attractive idea, but it is not the fail-safe mechanism we all might imagine.
The UK Independence Party will therefore be voting against this report.
<D>
Thank you very much, Mr Chairman, and I also thank Mrs Angelilli for her report.
I welcome the fact that the Slovenian Presidency chose as one of its priorities the question of children in armed conflicts, which was also one of my topics.
My opinion on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs also deals with the need to register children at birth.
Children who are not registered are invisible and therefore often become victims of sexual abuse or trafficking; they are imprisoned along with adults and are used as active combatants in the armed forces, because it is impossible to establish whether or not they are already adults.
The birth certificate of a child guarantees the child his name and nationality as well as access to medical care, for example.
I regret, however, that the report is only being adopted in January: the majority of the opinions were voted on and submitted to the committee before the summer and the report could thus have been adopted earlier.
A solution to this issue of children rights is needed urgently.
One illustration of this is the recent case of the transfer of more than 100 Chad children to France.
The aim of the action was to help the deserted families in Darfur; the children - orphans - would be looked after by foster parents in Europe.
The UN confirmed, however, that in the majority of cases the children were not orphans and did not come from Darfur, but from Chad, the neighbouring country.
Finding an urgent solution to the issue of children's rights is not only a necessity for developing countries: it is a necessity for us too.
<D>
(FR) Mr President, this has been a very fine French Presidency.
There have been very few discordant voices disagreeing with that conclusion.
The 27 Member States have overcome their differences and have reached a series of exemplary decisions.
On the energy and climate package, Europe is taking its first step, and it must be said that this first step is a huge one.
It now has the means to assume its environmental responsibilities without, however, sacrificing its economy.
It may now take the lead on the issue and carry the other continents with it along the road of sustainable development.
Additionally, Ireland is proposing a way in which it can escape from its isolation.
Our Irish friends will once again take a decision on the Treaty of Lisbon, but this time with all the cards in their hands, since practically all the other Member States will have made their final decisions.
The current crises show us that the European Union needs, now more than ever, the best institutional tools in order to be effective.
The European Council has adopted a massive, coordinated economic recovery plan, based on long-term investment in production and support targeted at the most severely affected industrial sectors.
President Sarkozy has raised the issue of the reduction of certain VAT rates, and I fully share his views.
Let us hope that the Ministers for Economic and Financial Affairs will in March reach the agreement that appeared impossible for the Heads of State or Government last weekend.
The challenges facing Europeans offer the EU an opportunity to demonstrate to citizens that they are more united, more responsive and more anxious to protect them.
We are grateful to the French Presidency for having instigated this new dynamism.
We, like Mr Sarkozy, hope it will be a long time before we see again the Councils of yesterday, which lasted till four in the morning and hardly succeeded in negotiating anything.
During the last six months, Europe has completely changed in terms of outlook, scope and credibility.
For this we ought to thank the French Presidency, and we are well aware that this is a role with which it is not entirely unfamiliar.
<D>
Mr President, I would like to welcome President Sarkozy again to Strasbourg and to congratulate him on engaging with Parliament, for being real with regard to ideas, even though he knew there would not be general agreement across the House with regard to those ideas.
For too long we have been hoisted with the petard of failed ideologies of the past, the failure to look to the new frontiers which come before us and to meet those challenges head on.
We have played safe by falling back into the comfort zone of either past imperialistic ideals or post-fascist commands or even, dare I say it, new 20th-century thinking with regard to human life and human rights.
Because the complexity of the world today is very different and far more varied than what can be offered by any one single ideology or any one single plan.
And rightly you mention the importance of engaging with other governments around the world: with China to solve the problem of Chad and of Sudan, ensuring that the problems with regard to Africa and the developing world are met head on.
We are already commemorating today the lives of seven peacekeepers in Sudan who have lost their lives under a United Nations mandate, simply because of a failure of governments to intervene properly and put pressure on the authorities in Chad and in Sudan to protect the lives of refugees and asylum seekers.
It is all very well to speak woolly words here in Parliament about the importance of immigration and allowing the free movement of people.
It is better if we allow people to stay at home.
I come from Ireland, a nation that had to export 12 million of its people over a hundred years.
None of them wanted to leave Ireland.
They were forced to leave Ireland.
If we give people the opportunity to remain in their own countries, give them support through the mechanisms of the policies that we set up, whether in trade or other areas, then we can do it.
Finally, Mr President-in-Office, you spoke earlier about how you felt the legitimacy of your position in bringing the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty before the parliament was the only way to do it.
I agree with you.
That is right for France.
But equally legitimate is the right to have a referendum and that should always be protected.
It is not an either/or.
There are problems and difficulties with regard to the result in Ireland, but that is not just a problem with regard to Ireland's relationship with Europe.
It is reflective of a deeper malaise for the people and Europe.
<D>
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) The EP motion for a resolution on East Timor is entirely appropriate.
It explains the tragic situation of the people of that country and the powerlessness of national authorities, international institutions and the peacekeeping forces.
The internal conflict is still continuing, despite many efforts and substantial international aid.
People are losing their lives, livelihoods are being destroyed and cultural heritage damaged.
There is widespread poverty affecting almost 80% of the population, unemployment, disenchantment and illiteracy.
All this is having a negative effect on the people, leading to despair and inciting revolt.
The people of East Timor want to live in peace and harmony.
They want to work, learn and develop their country's economy.
For this to happen, the democratic authorities in the country must be strengthened, and aid from international institutions increased.
The authors of this resolution therefore rightly call for East Timor to be assured political, technical and financial support.
They also recall that both the European Union and the United Nations have made public commitments to supporting independence, democracy and rule-of-law governments.
The Union for Europe of the Nations Group will support this resolution.
<D>
Thank you, Madam President.
I imagine that Mr Reynders will also be thanking you when his turn comes.
I would like to thank Parliament for its incredibly constructive approach during these rather lengthy negotiations, as evidenced by the debate that we have just had.
Mr Klinz spoke earlier about 'more transparency'.
I have always believed that transparency is an essential feature of responsibility within the entire financial services sector.
Which is why, in that very sector, we are now working together to create transparency, putting people under the spotlight who are probably unaccustomed to the glare.
Unlike Mrs Andreasen, I do not think that this transparency will hamper the finance industry's competitiveness.
I think it will have quite the opposite effect.
Back on 13 January, I explained to you that Europe is attractive to the financial industry: that is where we have the competitive edge over other regions of the world.
The financial sector has an interest in gradually, piece by piece - because, ladies and gentlemen, we have not yet finished - creating healthier, more transparent and more trustworthy foundations.
In fact, in my view, those foundations will often be a little more ethical.
As Mr Balz reminded us, this is the first time that we have introduced European rules for this key sector.
These rules will play a vital role in achieving a range of ambitious objectives and making real progress - the word used by Mr Bullmann earlier to describe the work done by this Parliament in conjunction with the Council and Commission.
Progress means improving the supervision of systemic risk; it means greater protection for investors, as Mrs Bowles pointed out.
It means a great deal more transparency in the private equity industry.
Mr Hökmark has stressed the importance of that industry.
And lastly, it means creating a real single market for alternative investment funds for institutional investors.
Mr Kamall has reiterated his concern, which I share, that there should be no discrimination.
Instead of discrimination, we now have a set of simple requirements.
I think that is the right solution.
I would like to remind all those who hoped to go further, that this is a compromise, a dynamic compromise.
We do not live in a perfect world, as Mrs Regner reminded us just now.
That is true.
We might have wanted to see a lot more progress than is found in the compromise text on which you will be voting, but it is a dynamic compromise and the review clauses mean that legislation will be able to evolve in the years to come.
I can tell Mr Giegold and Mr Klute that there will be further discussions and that we will be returning in particular to the question of passive marketing and the role of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA).
The latter was a point raised just now by Mr Karas, while Mr Goebbels rightly reminded us earlier of the importance of the ESMA.
Mr Goebbels, you mentioned 72 specific powers, within 11 different categories.
This means that the ESMA will have real powers, and we owe this largely to Parliament's efforts.
So let me thank each and every one of you.
Earlier, almost all of the speakers, from across all the groups, even those who are unlikely to vote in favour of this text, paid tribute to the rapporteur, Mr Gauzès, for being so receptive, for his expertise and for the quality of the relationships he has built.
I do not think that he will have time to take parental leave, because there is a lot more work to be done in the coming weeks.
Nevertheless, I would like to express my thanks to the whole Commission team who worked with me and are here this evening, and I would also like to add my voice, both personally and on behalf of the European Commission, to the chorus of thanks and gratitude addressed to the rapporteur, Mr Gauzès, in honour of his excellent work.
(Applause)
<D>
President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, I would like to thank Parliament for giving us the opportunity to address, during this session, the issue of the relationship with Russia.
As you certainly know, the Council discussed the relationship with Russia in depth some time ago, when we established the grounds and the rationale for the new EU-Russia agreement, and thus we consider it important that the negotiations for the new agreement are back on track.
After all, Russia is our biggest neighbour, one of our key partners and an indispensable player on the international scene.
Nowadays, when the economic crisis is hitting both of us equally hard, it is clear that confrontations will make neither of us any stronger.
Constructive, rational and mutually beneficial cooperation and fulfilment of international commitments by Russia, on the other hand, certainly could.
Moreover, a dialogue and a constructive engagement are important means of defending our interests and promoting our values vis-à-vis Russia.
This, in a nutshell, provided the main impetus for our decision to resume the negotiations on the new EU-Russia agreement, despite what happened in Georgia last August.
The crisis and its implications continue, certainly, to overshadow our relations.
The negotiations in no way legitimise Russia's conduct in Georgia, including in the territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and the EU has its red lines clearly set in this respect.
Our support for the territorial integrity of Georgia is clearly one of them.
We continue to expect Russia to behave responsibly and to honour all its commitments.
This in particular means that we will pay special attention to our common neighbourhood with Russia throughout the entire negotiation process.
The crisis in Georgia has demonstrated how unresolved conflicts can remain volatile even after many years, and that military action is not a solution.
We have to remind Russia that it has much to gain from behaving constructively towards its neighbours, and that it has much to lose if it continues on the path of confrontation.
Russia has, after all, already proved that it knows how to behave towards central European neighbours that are now part of both the EU and NATO.
We will continue to insist that Russia must abide by its international commitments and respect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Georgia and other eastern European countries that make up its common neighbourhood with the EU.
Full cooperation will also be expected from Russia as much as from Georgia at the Geneva talks.
I do not intend to set out in detail the current state of negotiations with Russia on the new agreement.
The Commission as the negotiator for the agreement will certainly be in a better position to update you on the process.
I should also recall that we are only at the beginning of the process, which could take some time.
We should not be discouraged if it only moves slowly at first.
I am sure, however, that by the end of our Presidency we will have greater clarity on what both sides want the new agreement to cover.
We are grateful to Janusz Onyszkiewicz for his report and the recommendations made in it.
In general we share many of your concerns as well as objectives.
I would now like to make a few remarks on the external security part of the new agreement, where the Presidency also plays a role in the negotiations.
It is of the utmost importance that the new agreement should contain provision to ensure effective dialogue and cooperation with Russia, and should be based on common values, compliance with the existing international commitments, the rule of law and respect for democracy, human rights and fundamental freedoms.
This is particularly important in relation to our common neighbourhood.
Indeed, it is essential if we are to see a solution to long-standing conflicts.
Conflict prevention is also an important objective.
It needs to be pursued through both political dialogue and joint initiatives.
There is already some movement with Russia on the scope of the political dialogue and external security part of the new agreement.
But of course the devil is in the detail.
The most interesting and challenging part of the negotiations is now beginning, as we begin to discuss concrete text proposals.
Given that negotiations are ongoing, it would not be appropriate to give you the details here.
I can, however, assure you that we will seek to obtain substantial provisions on strengthening dialogue on the international scene, on the fight against terrorism, on arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation, on human rights, democracy and the rule of law, on crisis management and on civil protection.
It was agreed at the EU-Russia summit in Khanty-Mansiysk that our shared aim was to conclude a strategic agreement that will provide a comprehensive framework for EU-Russia relations for the foreseeable future and help to develop the potential of our relationship.
This remains our objective and one that the Presidency, as well as the successive Presidencies, will continue to work towards.
We stand ready to keep this Parliament informed of the progress and are grateful for the input which you have provided, in particular through the text of your resolution.
<D>
I wish you, Lady Ashton, and the new EEAS, on which we are pinning great hopes that yet another European dream will come true, every success, and hope that Europe will address the world with a strong, authoritative single voice.
This is what a huge section of our Parliament wants.
You can be sure that we will help you.
I wish to explain why I abstained from voting on the amendment to the Staff Regulations of Officials of the European Communities.
I think that indicative targets for geographical balance are beneficial to the new institution.
We need a highly qualified diplomatic service which has people from every Member State so that they can enhance the representation of the EU in the world.
I am sure that the service will be a success if it can benefit from the experience of all Member States.
I realise that the number of Member States has increased more than fourfold since the start of the European integration process.
It is understandable that the countries recently admitted lag behind at this stage in terms of level of representation.
However, there must be determination and clearly defined legislative texts to overcome this.
I believe in your desire and determination, which you have expressed to us on numerous occasions, to work towards genuine, suitable geographical representation for the new service so that you can be the High Representative of the whole EU.
We will follow its activity closely.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I welcome this opportunity to explain where we are in the economic partnership agreement (EPA) negotiations.
I am glad to note that the strategy proposed by the Commission in its communication of 23 October was endorsed by the Council last week.
As Commissioner Mandelson said to Parliament's Committee on International Trade last week, we have turned a corner in these negotiations.
These negotiations are moving very quickly.
Let me give you a sense of where we stand at this moment.
In East Africa, a stepping-stone agreement has been initialled with the East African Community: Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and Tanzania.
We are very close to an interim deal with the Indian Ocean countries in the context of the Eastern and Southern Africa grouping.
In the Southern African Development Community, we have initialled a stepping-stone agreement with Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland and Mozambique.
Angola will join as soon as it is able.
South Africa and Namibia will decide on their participation in the next day.
Regarding the Pacific region, we are working in parallel on an umbrella agreement for the region as a whole and specific agreements on market access to safeguard the immediate interests of those countries which account for the region's trade with the European Union.
I expect agreement on those to be announced very shortly.
In the remaining regions, the picture is less clear.
For West Africa and Central Africa, meetings are taking place with so-called 'subgroups'.
It is possible that we will be able to conclude interim agreements on goods with the countries most affected, which could then be enlarged to full EPAs with the whole region in 2008.
That will, of course, depend on the wish of those concerned to take this route and to present WTO-compatible market access agreements.
In the Caribbean region, we have an agreement on nearly everything but, crucially, not on trade in goods, where the region's proposal falls well short of what can be defended in the WTO.
Negotiations are continuing, but we now need a clear political decision from the region to unlock the negotiations by producing a WTO-compatible market access schedule.
In all regions, we are taking a pragmatic and flexible approach to achieving what remains our objective for these agreements: full EPAs with four regions.
This will modernise our trade relationship and put it at the service of development, so full agreement with four regions is our objective.
We have made significant progress in recent days, but we cannot today guarantee that there will be an agreement including new WTO-compatible trade arrangements with all ACP countries.
WTO compatibility is the essential component of all agreements, whether they are full EPAs, stepping-stone agreements, or even goods-only deals.
Without this, we can only offer the generalised system of preferences.
Next week, the General Affairs and External Relations Council will decide on the EC regulation to implement the market access which has been offered to the ACP.
It is the best ever offer in a bilateral agreement: full duty/quota-free access, with transition periods for only two products - sugar and rice.
We will continue to do everything possible to reach agreements.
Our offer is on the table and the moment any ACP state provides a WTO-compatible offer to complete a deal, we can move quickly to propose to the Council that it should benefit from the EPA market access regulation.
We have indicated our willingness to work with subregions, if that is what the ACP states wish.
We have agreed to continue negotiating beyond 1 January 2008 on other issues, like services, investment and other trade-related areas, which are such an important part of the development component of these agreements.
We have delivered on our commitment to provide trade arrangements equivalent to or better than Cotonou to any country reaching an agreement with us.
We have offered to open our markets fully and match the goods trade offer with generous services offers.
What we cannot do is extend the Cotonou trade regime while we continue negotiations.
In the absence of an EPA, we have made clear that we cannot and will not propose solutions which are illegal or insecure.
Our ACP partners will need support to implement the agreements and make the necessary adjustments and reforms.
This is why the Commission is working to ensure that the European Development Fund will make 'aid for trade' in the context of EPAs a priority.
It is why we are working closely with Member States so that they bring additional money in the context of the newly-adopted EU aid-for-trade strategy.
We know that concluding these negotiations means taking difficult political decisions, but we welcome the leadership shown by those ACP regions and countries which have decided to join us in initialling EPA agreements.
We will continue to support them as they implement the commitments they have made and as we work together to ensure that this is a trade relationship that genuinely contributes to their development.
<D>
(PL) Mr President, history tends to repeat itself.
Three years ago the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe was signed.
The leaders of the EU Member States were greatly pleased and sure that the document would enter into force.
However, two nations expressed determined opposition in referendums.
The Heads of Government are now signing an almost identical text and count on being able to avoid referendums this time round.
Clearly, they underestimate this fundamental instrument of democracy.
The time publicly designated as a period of reflection was wasted.
Instead of being devoted to consultation, social dialogue and discussion, it was spent in devising machinery for manipulation.
It must be emphasised that the so-called Reform Treaty is a very high-ranking document, since it leads in fact to restrictions on the sovereignty of the Member States.
It transfers many of the prerogatives hitherto reserved for nation states to EU institutions that are not subject to real democratic control.
I am convinced that if the nations of Europe were given a voice, the treaty being signed tomorrow would share the fate of its predecessor.
<D>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to make a point of praising Stavros Dimas.
He tabled a very reasonable proposal.
It is a shame that Environment Minister Borloo did not give Mr Dimas strong support against the diehard reactionary Heads of State from Germany and especially Italy.
It was Mr Berlusconi and Mrs Merkel who made sure that we now have a directive which will result in 2012, when the rules in this directive have been exhausted, in higher average emissions from the new European car fleet than we have today.
Whatever happened to ambition?
Mr Langen, I asked you last time to bring me proof that you are capable of this sort of basic calculation.
I, at any rate, come on balance to the conclusion that this directive will not exert any pressure to innovate because, apart from the unambitious regulation of limit values, it recognises no penalty mechanism and because the limit value for 2020 was not made compulsory.
The current crisis in the automotive industry in Europe was caused by the automotive industry itself.
It slept through and sat out decades of pressure to innovate.
It failed to respond to the need to protect the climate or to the demands of the energy crisis and we are again passing up an opportunity to ensure there is constructive pressure here until well into the next decade.
Unless agreement is reached tomorrow on a binding long-term target, my group will be unable to vote for this directive.
I am sorry, Mr Dimas, that it should be so.
We must make an example of this directive.
We must ask ourselves if Europeans really are serious in their ambitions to protect the climate, if they are not more daring with their gas-guzzling cars and cars as status symbols than we are in this directive.
<D>
in writing. - I voted in favour of this report as I support the gradual decommissioning of nuclear power plants.
community decided could not be upgraded to meet minimum safety requirements for an economically reasonable cost.
The accession negotiations were used to get the three nuclear power plants closed by a set date and subsequently dismantled.
2.7 billion euro was set aside for this over the 1999-2013 period.
At the end of 2009, EUR 1.8 billion of this had already been allocated.
Despite this, there have been considerable delays in the implementation of the dismantlement programmes.
The European Parliament fears that these delays will lead to risks for the environment and human health.
I am satisfied with this report, not least because this House backed my amendments, which were tabled in the Committee on Budgetary Control and called for the funds to be managed and their resources to be used with absolute transparency.
The European Parliament also adopted my proposal to have the Commission report annually to Parliament and inform us of whether its forecasts that the resources set aside will be absorbed over the next three years prove accurate.
This report forms the basis for very close monitoring of this process and that is a positive thing from a wide variety of points of view.
<D>
in writing. - I voted in favour of this report as it contains many good ideas on how to progress our tourism policy.
However, I want to highlight the importance of industrial heritage and how this can help regenerate old industrial areas and still provide us with culture and history.
The preservation of our industrial heritage is just as important as the preservation of ancient artefacts or geographical phenomena.
I come from the region that gave birth to the Industrial Revolution, a revolution so fundamental to the lives of so many that it deserves recognition as part of our unique European culture.
Yet resources given to industrial heritage both at national and European level are small compared to other tourism sectors.
For example, the European body for Heritage and Museum Railways 'FEDECRAIL' leads the world in the area of railway preservation and yet receives little help from the European Union
The European Union should recognise the importance of industrial heritage and prioritise this particular branch of tourism so that young people can understand the significance of our industrial past.
Surely the time is now right to recognise the potential for industrial heritage to play a major role in any future European tourism policy.
<D>
Based also on my own personal experience obtained during a meeting of a delegation from the Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee in China between 16 and 21 March 2008, I voted for the Corien Wortmann-Kool report on commercial and economic relations with China.
Trade between the EU and China has increased dramatically since 2000.
The EU is China's largest trading partner and China is the second largest trading partner of the EU.
Although China enjoys significant advantages as a result of its membership of the WTO, European firms must overcome major obstacles in trying to gain access to the Chinese market, the main ones being breaches of patent rights and an ambiguous system of standards.
I welcome the intention of launching a 'Gateway to China' programme aimed especially at establishing training programmes for managers in China with a view to supporting access to the Chinese market for European SMEs by 2010.
The report provides recommendations for improving trade relations between Europe and China which must be based on principles of reciprocity, sustainable development, respect for environmental limits, contributions to global targets on combating climate change, fair economic competition and trade that is in accordance with our shared values and with WTO rules.
I welcomed the amended proposal in which the EU regards Taiwan as a commercial and trading entity and supports Taiwanese participation as an observer in relevant international organisations.
<D>
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development. - (CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, I would like to introduce a territorial dimension into the discussions on the Treaty of Lisbon.
It is a fact that individual local authorities, municipalities, and regions must cope, on a growing scale, with the impact of European law and European policies.
In connection with this, a survey by Utrecht University has shown that Community bodies annually adopt more than 100 regulations with an immediate impact on local authorities.
Seventy per cent of the legislation and measures we produce must actually be implemented in regions, towns, and local communities.
That is why the controversial Treaty of Lisbon may be perceived positively from the perspective of local authorities.
In actual fact, the Treaty of Lisbon contains a subsidiarity protocol, in other words a protocol under which the adoption of a norm at a higher level, in this case the European level, can be justified only when such a measure is demonstrably more efficient and more necessary.
Under the treaty, more effective consultations with local and regional authorities and their associations are required.
Another provision that would be introduced is the obligation of the European Commission to minimise the financial and administrative burden of each new legal regulation.
These measures should ensure that Brussels will be more attentive to the real problems confronting mayors and better prepared to solve them.
I would also like to stress here that this is quite definitely not the last change to primary law that we will be discussing.
Therefore, we should start thinking carefully about the changes that have to be made in order to render the EU's legal foundations comprehensible, firm, and beneficial to all citizens.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would not like to judge the positive and negative aspects of the Treaty of Lisbon here.
You all know that the Czech Republic's view is critical yet realistic.
This has been corroborated by today's debate in the Senate of the Parliament of the Czech Republic, which then approved the treaty later in the day.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - While the Commission cannot comment on the extent of the alleged practice referred to in the question, it shares the concerns about the impact on the European industry of the United States tax subsidy.
The subsidy appears to benefit all bio-diesel exported from and, by the way, sold in the United States, whatever its source.
According to the industry data, the US exports to the European Union rose from 100 000 tonnes in 2006 to 1 million tonnes in 2007, which is equal to about 15% of the European market.
My colleague, Commissioner Mandelson, has raised this on a number of occasions with his US counterpart, Trade Representative Susan Schwab.
He has advocated a change in the US legislation, for example restricting the subsidy to goods sold in the United States as a possible solution to the problem.
So far there has been no movement from the United States side and the tax credit remains in force.
The Commission would be prepared to consider an anti-subsidy investigation upon receipt of a properly documented complaint from the European Union industry containing sufficient evidence of countervailable subsidisation and injury.
The honourable Member asks whether the sustainability scheme proposed by the Commission in its proposal for the directive on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources, adopted by the Commission this January, will solve the problem created by the trading practice referred to in the question.
The sustainability scheme provided for by the Renewable Energy Directive is about ensuring the sustainability of biofuels.
It is designed to promote the use of sustainably produced biofuels while discouraging the use of poorly performing ones.
You will remember the 35% discussion.
The sustainability scheme would therefore not be able to address trading practices such as the one referred to in the question from the honourable Member.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I am really happy - and that is not just a diplomatic phrase - to be here today to speak on the occasion of this opportunity to boost Europe's innovations.
I think that Parliament's vote will be very important.
As Mr Paasilinna mentioned, we have come a long way since the beginning, but I would just like to remind the House that there was a lot of scepticism, reluctance and hesitation about the proposal to boost innovation by such an establishment and I am glad that we have been able to shift these original positions into a consensual and supportive position on the part of Member States, Parliament, the Institutions and partners.
I recall the efforts of the Finnish, then the German, Portuguese and now the Slovenian Presidencies.
In particular I would like to express gratitude here to Parliament's rapporteur, Mr Paasilinna, because he was very instrumental and supportive, and also to the chairwoman of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, Ms Niebler, as well as Mr Böge, the chairman of the Committee on Budgets, and the rapporteur of the Committee on Culture and Education, Ms Hennicot-Schoepges.
Without these efforts and contributions we would not have been able to arrive at this moment.
I think this is an opportunity to show that Europe has the capacity and also a strong commitment to improving its innovation capacity in the globalised world.
Technological innovation is the key to growth, jobs and competitiveness, and this is the basis for the social wellbeing of our citizens.
We are proposing to fully integrate the three sides of the knowledge triangle - education, research and innovation - by the cooperation of partners from business, research and academia.
These will work together in so-called knowledge and innovation communities.
I think that now is the time to set the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) into motion after all the preparations.
We have already taken some steps, as you know, and I have informed the committee that we have launched a procedure for the identification of the governing board.
There is a special high-calibre, independent identification committee which is now preparing criteria.
We will then try to set up a group of 18 persons to start as the governing board.
The identification committee works totally independently and autonomously.
I think this is essential for the success of the EIT and the legitimacy of the governing board.
Parliament and the Council will be kept fully informed of the selection procedure and the outcome.
The Commission will draw up an interim report after completion of the first step of the selection procedure and a final report once the procedure is finished.
Parliament and the Council will then have one month to take note of the proposed members of the EIT governing board.
Their excellence, their undisputed reputation, total independence and ability to represent their interests from the sectors they represent - universities, research and business - will, I think, be an essential ingredient for the credibility of the Institute in the short and the long term.
Allow me to underline an element of the utmost importance.
I would like to formally state that the European Commission is fully committed to respecting the principles of the autonomy and independence of the board, which are enshrined in the regulation, and it will not have any role in the EIT's strategic decision-making.
On this basis the Commission will provide administrative and financial support to the board at its request and to the extent that is necessary in the kick-off stage.
There must be some assistance at the beginning.
Such support is intended to enable the board to select the first Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs) within the 18-month deadline and will in no way pre-empt its strategic decision-making.
It is in our common interest to see the EIT operational within the timeframe foreseen in the regulation.
I am really looking forward to the successful establishment of the EIT and once again I would like to express my deep gratitude for Parliament's commitment and contribution.
<D>
Mr President, I also supported the Auken report.
I supported it because many of my constituents in the north-east of England are among the petitioners who petitioned Parliament about this disgraceful and flagrant abuse of property rights by the Spanish Government and local authorities.
Indeed they were recently the subject of a TV documentary by ITV North East, where some of these heart-rending cases were brought to life and were examined for the public of the north-east to see.
I hope even now, at this late stage, that the Spanish Government and Spanish MEPs will right some of the wrongs that have been done and will give some restitution to some of these people who have been unlawfully denied their property and recognise that, actually, what has gone on here is a scandal.
It is a corrupt scandal.
Many of the deals involving property developers and Spanish local government are, frankly, the result of corruption.
We serve nobody by failing to recognise that essential point.
The Spanish Government needs to act.
I am, frankly, appalled at some of the abuses that have gone on in this Chamber by Spanish MEPs seeking to cover up these practices.
<D>
(ET) I would like to make a statement concerning my vote on the Working Time Directive.
It has to do with the fact that my voting machine malfunctioned in the vote on amendment motions 34 and 35.
I voted in favour of those motions, but the machine showed a red light.
I continue to hold the opinion that all on-call time, including inactive time at certain points, is working time.
Why do I think this?
It does not depend on the doctor or the fire fighter (who is required to be at work by his or her employer, who specifically requires a service to be provided), whether a patient needs a doctor or whether a fire breaks out.
That does not depend on those people.
They are at their workplace, this is working time, and I would request that my voting status on these issues be corrected in the minutes.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - It is clear that we have had very many challenges in the last couple of years.
However, regarding North Africa for instance, I must say that - as was just mentioned - what started in Tunisia was, among other things, triggered by the increase in food prices there.
I think that the world saw that climate change is not the only reason why we have increases in food prices, but climate change is a threat multiplier.
It makes other kinds of threats worse.
It is not an 'either/or' situation.
However, I think that in many respects it is dawning on ever more countries, governments, businesses and sectors that there is a link between how we address climate change and how we provide security for people.
Subject: Costs of cutting CO2 in the European Union
The European Union is planning to cut CO2 emissions by 20% by 2020.
This ambitious target cannot be attained without affecting the economies of the Member States.
Firms are already moving their production out of the EU as they are unable to afford the cost of European climate policy.
Has the Commission carried out any simulations to show how cutting CO2 emissions will affect the economies of the EU Member States?
Which countries will be hit hardest by this move and how will it affect their GDP?
What would be the costs to the Member States' economies of a target to cut emissions by 10 and 15% by 2020?
<D>
Madam President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and, through her, my colleague, Mr Mavrommatis, but, of course, especially the Ombudsman himself on another successful year.
Three hundred or so complaints a month is a huge workload and equates both to rising interest in the system but also to rising concern at aspects of EU maladministration.
Whilst many cases are dealt with by cooperation, the Ombudsman refers to the increase in critical comment that he is forced to make.
This must improve, or Parliament will have to find ways of compelling the Commission to be helpful and responsive and, equally, to act upon the conclusions produced by the Ombudsman.
He makes telling comments.
I want to pick out one: 'I am not sure that the citizen can easily reconcile the statements often made by the institutions that they want to get "closer to the citizen” with the fact that the very same institutions frequently fail to take up the opportunities offered by the Ombudsman to improve relations.'
The services of the Ombudsman should, and do, work hand in hand with the Committee on Petitions, but the Commission must develop a culture of service rather than the avoidance of problems, and Ministers and permanent representatives must understand the vital importance of responding positively to grievances from constituents and citizens, voiced either through the Ombudsman or the Petitions Committee.
Finally, may I make a brief reference to an outstanding special report by the Ombudsman, namely that relating to a complaint against OLAF.
As the Petitions Committee rapporteur for this issue, I give notice now that, the judicial process having been completed on this case, I will not allow the issue of the special report to be swept under the carpet.
It will be reconsidered as soon as is practically possible.
May I conclude with thanks, again, not only to you, Madam President, for delighting us with your presence, but also to the Ombudsman and the Commissioner for being here as well.
<D>
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the waste problem in Campania is no longer just a health and environmental disaster, but is becoming an economic and institutional whodunit.
While the judiciary will shed light, we hope, on the economic whodunit, we need further enlightenment as regards the institutional whodunit.
On 11 September 2007, the Commission, in reply to a question from me, said it was concerned but hopeful that the urgent measures taken by the Italian authorities would help to resolve the situation and also said that it would take the measures set out in Article 226 of the Treaty if the investigation under way brought to light infringements of the law.
On 2 January 2008, however, the Commission's spokesperson said that infringement proceedings against Italy had been opened in June 2007.
Where does the truth lie?
In what was said in reply to me on 11 September or in what was said by the spokesperson?
Why did the Commission make no mention of these infringement proceedings in its reply?
The fact that some European political groups, close to the Prodi government, have come out against a joint resolution on the health and environmental disaster in Campania which should have concluded our debate opens up another whodunit.
When there are more coincidences than might normally be expected, it is highly likely that an interest is being defended, and when the political interest, however unconsciously, espouses other interests, which coincide, moreover, with those of the 'eco-mafias', the question is no longer one of left or right or merely of political incapacity.
We strongly suspect that the European institutions have been intentionally misled for reasons connected with partisan interests.
The high levels of dioxin in the area, the persisting illegality of the situation, the keenness for Parliament to abandon its responsibility for a joint resolution, are bound up with the political choices of the Italian Government, the Region of Campania and the Naples local authority which, coincidentally, come from the same political mould.
We call for urgent action by OLAF to monitor the use of the funds appropriated up to now and to ensure that future funds are correctly managed.
We call on the Commission to explain to Parliament, within thirty days from now, where the responsibility for this disgraceful and tragic emergency that is no longer regional, but national and European, lies, and to whom it can be attributed.
<D>
in writing. - (PT) The European Parliament 'gives its assent to the conclusion of the agreement' ...
Behind these nine words are 65 pages of an 'agreement' which, among many other negative aspects, is ruled by the euphemistically termed 'principles of free market economy'.
In addition to some worrying political aspects, the primary objective of the agreement is the integration of Bosnia and Herzegovina within the European internal market, as a way of ensuring that the EU's major transnationals have control over its economy.
The agreement is littered with the terms 'free trade', 'free movement of capital', 'liberalising the establishment and supply of services' and 'liberalisation of transport' (air, maritime, inland waterways and land).
Its aim is to ensure that, within six years, Bosnia and Herzegovina has 'properly implemented and enforced' the Community acquis on free competition in the internal market and also 'other trade-related areas'.
Obviously, we support the further development of friendly relations with other countries, but this must be in response to their real needs.
These relations must be mutually beneficial and contribute to reciprocal development and the principle of non-interference and respect for national sovereignty must be observed.
However, this agreement is contrary to this principle.
<D>
(PT) In the context of this very serious financial and economic crisis, it is absolutely essential to make progress in concluding the Doha negotiations.
At a time of crisis, there is always a tendency to give way to the temptation of protectionism.
Protectionism is actually a kind of neurosis which tends to affect societies and states at times when they are faced with serious crises, such as the one we are experiencing.
We must therefore clearly fight against the possible emergence of this protectionist temptation, because we know from history where that leads us.
It leads to the general impoverishment of the world community and in no way contributes to solving the grave problems that confront us.
One thing, however, is protectionism, which is to be criticised absolutely and should be resisted, and another, quite different thing is the need to guarantee the protection of legitimate interests in the various areas of the world into which we are divided.
That is where the European Union also has an obligation to uphold the interests of Europeans, and not just the interests of Europeans as consumers, but also the interests of Europeans as producers.
That is why it is important to proceed with the multilateral Doha negotiations.
Whilst we know that protectionism is in fact a mistake, we also know that uncontrolled liberalisation of international trade inevitably leads to very serious disasters from an economic and social point of view.
The only way to avoid such uncontrolled liberalisation is by possibly establishing an agreement in the appropriate forum, that is, the World Trade Organization, a multilateral agreement that establishes rules to safeguard the legitimate interests of all the parties concerned.
The role of the European Commission and of the European Union, in this case too, is precisely to restore Europeans' confidence.
There is also a crisis of confidence in Europe today in terms of the capacity for defence and political regulation of those who represent it, whether the Member States, the European Commission or the European Union as a whole.
Therefore, the challenge we face is precisely that of helping to put an end to this crisis of representation and confidence by ensuring that we are advancing along the right path.
The right path, in this case, is to guarantee a multilateral agreement which safeguards all our legitimate interests.
<D>
Yesterday I mentioned during the debate that I consider the present compromise to be an honourable one and that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance in the European Parliament will be endorsing it.
I wish to stress, however, that, in order to reach agreement with the farming lobby and the pesticides industry, we had to make a few concessions.
Whichever way you look at it, what was achieved in terms of the cut-off criteria is a watered-down result when compared to the EP's position at first reading.
Derogation options were expressly created for 12 substances.
We also had our reservations with regard to the zonal approach.
The idea of three zones across such a vast expanse strikes us as problematic because the environmental circumstances within any of those zones can vary enormously.
What is positive, though, is that the legal basis is founded on agriculture, the internal market and public health, with the concern for public health being given top priority in the relevant recitals and in Article 1.
Equally, the cut-off criteria for substances that have unacceptable effects on bees are a welcome addition.
The requirement to replace dangerous products with safe alternatives more quickly was also complied with.
Whilst the outcome could have been better, we voted on an acceptable compromise.
<D>
President of the Commission. - As you said, it is correct that EUR 200 billion of investment is needed for gas infrastructures and power grids up to 2020.
It is estimated that EUR 100 billion of this total investment need will be delivered on time by the market alone, whereas the other EUR 100 billion will require public action on permitting and leveraging the necessary private capital.
That is why we are now proposing, for instance, unbundling.
We are proposing many measures that will make this private investment more rational and more useful.
We will also take a closer look at tariff regulation practices in order to liberate adequate cost allocation principles.
To fill the remainder of the gap, the Commission proposes a new financial instrument to support projects of European interest for the new financial perspective after 2013.
Beyond grants, innovative market-based solutions may be proposed such as equity participations, guarantees and public-private partnership loans.
As you know, I already spoke about European funds through project bonds specifically designed for this kind of project.
<D>
(NL) Bosnia and Herzegovina is in actual fact a pocket-sized Yugoslavia, a federation in which different peoples must choose between living together peacefully or battling out internal conflicts over the territory.
Since Yugoslavia fell apart in 1992, attempts have been made to turn Bosnia and Herzegovina into a unitary state, but to no avail.
I expect this will not be possible in the near or distant future.
Agreement among the three peoples and their political leaders on effective governance is possible only when nobody feels threatened any more by the others or by the outside world.
Only when the EU's High Representative and foreign soldiers have withdrawn from this country will a compromise be possible.
Until then, the stagnation will persist.
Therefore I am not voting in favour of the proposed resolution on this country, which can only lead to the continuation of the protectorate and thus of stagnation.
We must bear in mind that Bosnia and Herzegovina is inhabited principally by three peoples, none of whom constitutes a majority in that country and some of whom feel connected to Serbia, a part with Croatia, while others want to stress a specifically Bosnian identity.
We must take that into account.
<D>
in writing. - I welcome this report as a necessary adjunct to the type approval for the general safety of motor vehicles legislation approved earlier this year, which is mainly concerned with environmental and safety standards for tyres.
We need tyres to be safer, more fuel efficient and quieter.
Traffic noise, of which tyre noise is an important component, is a major cause of ill health.
Reducing fuel consumption will be of great benefit to the consumer at a time of increasing austerity but it will also reduce CO2 emissions and contribute to the EU's ambitious goals in climate change reduction.
With the labelling process consumers will be able to make an informed choice when buying tyres but also when deciding on which car to buy.
We must monitor, though, how effective the labels are.
We must ensure that consumers really do understand them, otherwise the whole exercise will be meaningless.
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Madam President, the American continent as a whole is the closest to Europe in terms of values, ideals, vision of the world and individuals, their dignity and their rights.
What we call the West to my mind clearly includes Latin America.
In recent years there have been some positive trends in Latin America as a whole, bringing it ever closer to Europe: pluralist elections and democratic consolidation, growth with more balanced and open economic policies, regional integration processes and very important agreements with the European Union.
However, there are exceptions in this positive panorama: in addition to the traditional one of Cuba, that of Venezuela is now emerging.
This country is going through a process of increasing authoritarianism in which freedoms are being restricted, the opposition is being harassed and fear is being created among the people who even suspect that their vote is no longer secret.
In this House we regret the closure last May of Radio Caracas Televisión.
On Sunday a constitutional referendum will hurriedly be held which aims to introduce an authoritarian and exclusive regime and which proposes to establish what is being termed 'Socialism for the 21st century'.
An until recently very close associate of President Chávez has even termed the process a 'coup'.
I regret that an election observation mission from the European Union has not been officially invited.
What is more, this referendum is being held in a climate of violence and tension which has even cost the lives of students who also reject the plan.
In recent years, physical and legal insecurity, kidnaps and land occupations have also increased.
As a result, for example, many of my Galician compatriots have left the country at the average rate of one thousand people per year since President Chávez came to power.
Emboldened by high oil prices, President Chávez is looking for followers and allies in other countries, he is making a lot of noise in international forums and he is intervening in the sovereign affairs of his neighbours.
As President Uribe has said, President Chávez wants to set the continent alight.
His attitude is a problem for the democratic stability of Venezuela and for harmony and integration processes in Latin America as a whole.
He is also disrupting the relations which have been expanding in the last decade between countries on that continent and the European Union.
Bearing in mind the next Lima Summit, the attitude of President Chávez represents a serious challenge which must be carefully considered by the European Union and its Member States.
<D>
Mr President, Georgia is not a simple episode in international politics.
It is the beginning of a chain reaction with important consequences.
First, it indicates Russia's military comeback, which will have to be reflected in the new European security strategy under preparation.
Second, this apparent reconquista indicates Russia's desire to use its newly acquired energies in making good its losses from the 1990s and pay back for the accompanying humiliation, rather than willingness to contribute to the shaping of the future world.
Third, it highlights the weak position of Europe due to increasing energy dependence on Russia and the delay in ratification of the Lisbon Treaty.
Fourth, it can either restore or further damage transatlantic unity.
Fifth, it demonstrates that international legality needs to be strengthened both in concept and in respect.
Sixth, it makes clear that the Black Sea area needs much more attention and involvement from the EU and therefore that it requires more than a simply synergy.
<D>
(NL) Mr President, we are having this debate today because citizens and governments are worried about the construction of this pipeline.
They are worried because the environment in the sensitive Baltic sea area is at risk.
The debate has, however, become hugely politicised.
Everyone agrees that we have to respect all of the international and environmental conventions, certainly when it comes to the sensitive Baltic Sea area.
Mr President, the politicisation that is happening here has nothing to do with that.
We have to admit that we need the energy, that domestic production, in the Netherlands as elsewhere, is continuing to fall and so we need the gas from other sources.
That gas comes from Russia.
It would have been much better to transport that gas over land but that has been made impossible.
Now we have to go through that sensitive area.
My first point, therefore, concerns respect for all international and environmental conventions.
My second point - and I hope that not everyone has been deaf to this - is that a satisfactory environmental impact report has to lead to the issuing of permits.
These permits would have to be issued by Germany, by Denmark, by Sweden and also by Finland.
We will have to pass judgment on this later on another occasion, at the end of the year.
Another point is that we also need a certain degree of reciprocity.
We are dependent on Russian gas and the Russians are dependent on our willingness to purchase it.
I hope that this reciprocity will soon be properly regulated in the partnership agreement, without all the political emotions triggered by this project.
Then we will be able to resolve a great many problems.
<D>
in writing. - (RO) Mountains cover one third of the area of the country that I represent, Romania, and the inhabitants of mountain areas are disadvantaged compared to other people living in rural areas.
The proposals contained in the Ebner report are welcome and I strongly believe that a coherent EU strategy on mountain areas, which is essential and urgent, would contribute to a great extent to an improvement in living conditions in these areas.
At the same time, I would like to stress that better regulations are required, with equal urgency, as regards community funding for rural development.
For instance, Romanian authorities have launched various EAFRD-funded programmes supporting small enterprises and tourism.
Small enterprises and boarding houses are particularly important for boosting mountain areas.
The guides for applicants for these measures, involving complex paperwork, were made public one day before the launch of the session, although they had been written in August.
This is a clear breach of the principle of providing fair and transparent information to potential beneficiaries.
I believe that EU legislation should provide for the avoidance of such situations, which render the EU's financial effort useless.
<D>
Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, I should like to thank the honourable Members, the rapporteur and the members of the Committee on Budgetary Control.
The discussion on discharge has been very intensive this year, and the Commission has made several commitments to follow up Parliament's observations and recommendations.
We will continue this intensive process, starting in May, when there will be a discussion in the Committee on Budgetary Control about our plans for next year.
This is an intensive process, and I would like to assure Parliament that we take our commitments very seriously and are going ahead with the proposals and ideas we have in common on increasing accountability, on cooperation with Member States and on increasing the responsibility of Member States in shared management issues.
That is our common line, and we will work seriously on all those action plans and proposals.
There are different types of agencies.
Firstly, there are executive agencies, which are clearly the responsibility of the Commission, and for which you give discharge to the Commission.
We have some executive agencies, but have decided to have a moratorium on the establishment of new executive agencies.
What are the concerns surrounding traditional agencies?
The problem of governance is a serious one, and there are several weak points as regards how to administer and handle those agencies.
We should probably hold serious discussions on governance issues, but we should also not underestimate the political observations on their work - what they are doing and what the real benefits are - and Parliament has a very important role to play in evaluating and assessing how successful they are.
Neither should we underestimate the positive aspects of both decentralisation and of having European bodies spread across Europe.
That is not such a bad idea, if everybody considers his or her own country.
I should like to thank you once again for all your contributions, remarks, debates and discussions.
We will continue with our commitments and action plans.
<D>
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by taking up what Mr Schulz said.
I would emphasise once again that we are not making an honest assessment of the Lisbon Strategy if we ignore the fact that, while Europe is indeed a major winner from globalisation, the winnings are very unevenly distributed.
In addition, employment growth has by no means resolved the problem of the working poor; on the contrary, despite increased employment and increased growth, we also have increased poverty caused by job insecurity.
We in the European Parliament called explicitly in our resolution for the issue of sectoral minimum wages to be addressed by the Commission and the Council, and for the Commission to assess the results of the Lisbon Strategy differently in view of the problem of growing social marginalisation.
This poverty indicator is an integral part of our resolution, and I find it regrettable that neither the Council nor the Commission has so far responded to these decisions of the European Parliament.
(Applause)
Turning to the subject of climate and energy, quite frankly I was shocked when a German Government representative declared in Brussels, just a few days before this spring summit, that environment policy ought to steer clear of industrial and economic policy.
This pronouncement was made by a State Secretary in the German Ministry of the Environment, Mr Machnik, who is no doubt known to my German colleagues.
Germany's Environment Ministry obviously has no real understanding of what sustainability actually means.
It is hardly surprising, consequently, that the German Government continues to oppose CO2 limits on vehicles, that it is not in favour of the single market for energy as proposed by the Commission and that it is attempting to organise an alliance against the 'new definitions of emissions trading'.
I note with regret that, in these negotiations, Germany has partially forgotten what was signed and sealed at last year's spring summit.
Some of its current policies are totally at odds with the outcomes of last year's summit.
I am not certain, for example, that the new priority attached to renewable energy - which appears so uncontroversial - really is sufficient to ensure sustainability in the field of energy and the climate.
The Mediterranean Union also raises questions in my mind.
One sometimes gets the impression that, just like those major gas deals with Russia - I mean North Stream and South Stream - this Mediterranean Union is further proof that a uniform EU policy on energy and security of energy supply is simply not possible.
If the Council fails to tackle this problem, it will fall short of its obligations.
(Applause)
<D>
(PT) This crisis is the result of too much liberalism and has put an end to the illusion that democracy and the market could solve all the world's problems.
The question that the next Council must answer is this: has the European Union done everything it should have done and at the right time?
I hope the Council has the courage to make the decisions that the people expect.
Fine words are not enough; we need good decisions.
What is the use of talking about supervision, regulation and sustainable growth if we do not get rid of tax havens and the casino economy?
Good intentions are not enough; we need results.
The EU 2020 strategy will be of little use if there is no real economic governance of the Union.
The future of the Union is in our hands.
It cannot be dependent on credit ratings issued by agencies that serve the interests of speculators.
The Union is an extraordinary instrument, but we have not known how to make proper, thorough use of it.
<D>
- (EL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to talk about the tragic political situation in Lebanon and the role that the EU is urgently called upon to play.
Today is all too typical of this crisis, because once again the election of the President of the Republic has been postponed.
Regional power squabbles affecting Lebanon have deepened the rift between political groups.
As a result, the people are being held hostage, there is a risk of civil war and the whole area is unstable.
The EU, which is in partnership with Lebanon, is following an action plan determined by its Neighbourhood Policy.
The EU and its Member States contribute 40% of international development aid.
The Union has met its responsibilities in the strengthened peacekeeping force.
Yet all this is useless unless a national agreement is reached to avert the crisis.
The way ahead is difficult, if not impossible, owing to the failure of the presidential election.
The Union must play its part as an effective negotiator and initiate real dialogue.
We have no time to dither; we cannot just wait and see.
<D>
Madam President, high oil and gas prices are here to stay and I doubt very much whether we will see the price much below USD 80 per barrel ever again.
The West was caught on the hop and underestimated the rise in Chinese and Indian consumption, the under-investment in exploration and extraction technologies, the inability - or unwillingness, perhaps - of Saudi Arabia to turn on its taps as a swing producer, and the geopolitical risks of countries like Venezuela, Nigeria or Iraq.
What is the answer, in my view?
We must, of course, consume less, invest in renewables and new technologies like hydrogen-fuel-cell cars and look at whether biofuels, in terms of their overall effect, are good or bad in terms of global emissions and in food inflation for the developing world.
Those in this House, particularly on the Left, who believe it is all down to speculation are wrong, as you cannot hoard physical oil in large quantities as a speculator and take delivery.
Only the United States of America has the facility to do that.
Lastly, I welcome Italy's decision to build a nuclear reactor, which I hope other EU Member States will follow.
<D>
Mr President, my report is in line with all the previous documents on multilingualism, whether they came from this House, the Council or the Commission.
The alternative tabled is an attempt to bring into the European Parliament certain nationalist disputes that are ongoing in Spain.
Just yesterday the Spanish newspaper El País reported that the Spanish Supreme Court decided three months ago that a box should be included on pre-enrolment forms asking parents in which language they want their children to receive their education, and also that the Catalan authorities are not complying with this decision.
The signatories of the alternative do not want this right to be recognised for parents in countries with more than one official or regional language.
They do not want to recognise the vital need for education in the mother tongue, not only for educational success in general but also in particular for the learning of other languages.
They do not want to ensure full mutual intelligibility between the languages spoken in a country in this situation, especially in relation to senior citizens and to the legal system, health, administration and employment.
They do not accept that, in these countries, one language should not be promoted at the expense of the rights of speakers of another language or other languages.
This contradicts everything that this Parliament and the other European institutions have upheld.
As a result, paragraphs 11, 12, 14 and 17 of my report are omitted from the alternative.
Looking at these paragraphs, such negative positions clearly clash with our fundamental rights and freedoms and patently infringe the principle of subsidiarity.
My report does not attack or harm so-called minority languages.
It respects these and recognises their value, but it also tries to lay down general and basic principles.
This House cannot be an instrument of extremist nationalism nor of regional or local hatred or aversion.
It is our responsibility as MEPs that is at stake.
I therefore urge you to vote against the alternative and in favour of the report that I have authored.
<D>
Mr President, this House must promote statesmanship, which sadly today it is not doing.
Ten million homeless people is an enormous disaster - the worst in the world.
We saw a people-concerned, people-centred Chinese Government and leadership in action in an area which has one of the biggest populations, including more than one million Tibetans.
Unlike in Burma where the rulers did not and do not care, the Chinese Government demonstrably cares for its own people.
This was self-evident to anyone who saw the relief effort.
Human rights in China cannot be decided by other countries, powers, organisations or people in the rest of the world.
It can only be decided by the 1.3 billion Chinese population for themselves.
We well know that this population can be articulate, can demonstrate and show their anger, and they do show it when something is wrong.
The human rights situation in China is improving and can be improved further.
Parliament and my colleagues shouting about it is not going to make any difference.
We are, as usual, deluding ourselves about how important we are.
It will be the Chinese people who, having been lifted out of poverty, will ask for themselves greater democratic expression.
Four hundred million people have been lifted out of poverty - a remarkable achievement.
But the Chinese people are afraid.
By turning our backs on them as we did over the Olympic Torch, we only infuriate the people of China, not their government.
This distinction is important and should be understood.
<D>
The main objective yet to be achieved is a global agreement which is legal and ambitious and aims to keep the temperature increase below 2 °C, or even 1.5 °C, above pre-industrial levels.
The measure of agreement reached in Cancún is a step in that direction.
I agree with those who say today that we have a lot to do yet.
The governments must build on that achievement now.
The gaps must be filled.
The difficult issues on the agenda must be tackled, and targets must be set now that are much firmer, clearer and binding.
The deadlines between now and COP 17 in South Africa must be adhered to.
My thanks also, therefore, to the Council and the Commission for what we have achieved, but we still face hard work ahead.
In Europe, we must agree immediately to a reduction of at least 30% in CO2 leakage in Europe, not only for the sake of international agreement but for our own sake.
<D>
Mr President, if one thing has come out of the debate it is that there is concern about effective combating of trafficking in human beings - and, in particular, trafficking in children - amongst a large majority in this House.
That is the greatest use of this measure that we will adopt and I am delighted by the fact that almost all the speakers have touched on this.
I would like to once again thank all the shadow rapporteurs for their collaboration, and that is not idle praise.
It is fair to say that my colleague Mrs Roure played a crucial role in securing the agreement, to which Commissioner Barrot and the French Presidency also contributed a lot.
I particularly wish to thank Commissioner Barrot for the Commission's readiness to give institutional backing to invigorating the fight against trafficking in children, as well as its readiness to collaborate in the three studies which we requested: on the reliability of children's fingerprints, on breeder documents and on false rejection rates, which are some of the concerns that we have in relation to the implementation of these rules.
Finally, Mr President, Mr Brejc raised an issue: he asked if we are able to say that the issuing of passports is secure.
To be completely honest, I have to say that this varies from country to country.
Some countries have more rigorous systems than others, and that is another reason why the study on breeder documents is very important.
I know that Europe has no jurisdiction over this area - the issuing of passports is a national prerogative - and that is why I was very happy when Commissioner Barrot agreed to having the European Commission collaborate in this study on breeder documents.
It makes no sense for us to have passports that are very secure if this security might be sabotaged during the issuing process.
It is a case not of imposing measures on Member States, but of sharing best practices so that we can guarantee that the European passport is a secure reality on our external borders.
Thank you very much to all of you for your collaboration.
<D>
Mr President, this evening Parliament is doing something new.
I think that all the speakers, starting with the Commissioner, have highlighted the somewhat abstruse nature of comitology.
The proof of this is that we do not have anyone from the public following this debate this evening, and if I had to explain to my electorate what I am doing here tonight at eleven o'clock, it would be very hard work.
I think that the various speakers have mentioned this difficulty, and I think that, with our concern to make the EU institutions a little more attractive, we will need to find some sort of procedure for explaining to citizens what we are actually discussing.
Of course, the package of measures that we are considering is quite broad.
As the Commissioner said, there are four omnibus packages.
We are only looking at the first and the third, and article by article we are seeing the problems that arise from the point of view of implementation.
As the rapporteur and the other speakers said, this is a necessary exercise, but obviously we should try to clarify it.
Perhaps it is worth mentioning some of the subjects.
For example, Council Directive 76/160/EEC concerning the quality of bathing water or Council Directive 91/271/EC concerning urban waste-water treatment.
The procedure adopted will have practical consequences for citizens, but the question is how to make them aware of it.
I think that Mr Szájer has done a good job, that in Parliament we have tried to act with a sense of responsibility, that we are going to continue doing so and that the only thing that is going to remain for us to do is this part, which is conveying to citizens what we are really doing here, and this is quite difficult.
I think that this will be our challenge, and, continuing what we have achieved and what we are doing this evening, I think that we will have to do that second part in the future so that the parliamentary debate then will not be as bleak as the one we are having this evening.
<D>
rapporteur. - (SL) This report concerns everyone - the sick and the healthy.
Health is one of the key social and political issues on which the future of the European Union hangs.
The importance of health to the economy is clearly stated in the Lisbon Strategy.
Health is one of the most important assets of human life.
Due to worrying health trends, especially the rise in cancer cases, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and obesity, and despite the improvements in curative medicine, this asset is under increasing threat.
In addition, there are new challenges such as ageing population, climate change, rising food prices and globalisation.
There has been talk of pandemics and bioterrorism.
On the one hand the World Health Organization has forecast an epidemic rise in cancer cases in future years, and on the other there are ever-stronger demands for patients and medical workers to have freedom of movement.
Health systems and their financing are coming under increasing pressure.
In recent years the cost of medicines has been rising faster than overall health costs, giving rise to public concern about equality of healthcare and the sustainability of health systems.
Citizens are worried that there will not be sufficient healthcare for all.
They are not interested in debates about competences; they are primarily interested in the best way to be healthy.
They are also concerned about equality of healthcare, which is considerable among the Member States, as also within the countries themselves.
As far as cancer is concerned, differences in survival rates between the new and old Member States are such that we could justifiably talk of an iron curtain in health.
All this is a reason for health to be afforded greater importance in the European political agenda.
We are not talking about Any Other Business but about Survival.
That is why we need a common strategic approach.
At the end of 2007 the European Commission adopted a health strategy entitled 'Together for Health'.
This strategy is a product of the commitment by the Member States and the Union to respect the common values and principles of health policy when ensuring the conditions for realising citizens' rights and responsibilities in their personal healthcare throughout their life, in their active involvement in decision-making and the adjustment of healthcare to patients' needs, in reducing inequalities in healthcare among different social groups, Member States and the regions within them, in understanding the investment in healthcare as a condition of economic development, and in the consistent inclusion of health in policies at all levels.
It is clear that the health sector really needs a long-term strategic and comprehensive approach, which will require all the main actors in the Member States and at European Union level to work in cooperation.
If we want to improve cooperation we need to determine which forms of interinstitutional cooperation can enhance the effectiveness of our joint efforts.
We need a key strategic shift in the area of disease prevention.
Although the importance of preventing disease has been highlighted for many years, only 3% of the health budgets of the Member States is devoted to that purpose.
At the same time we know that it is precisely a prevention policy that would help us to achieve much better results.
Forty percent of diseases are linked to unhealthy lifestyles, and a third of cancers are also preventable.
One of the main messages in this report is the call on the Commission to prepare an ambitious plan of preventive measures for the entire five-year period.
I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, the Commission and everyone who contributed to the consensus opinion on what needs to be done to improve health.
<D>
Mr President, it can be a fine line between transparency and infringement of privacy.
Many farmers - in my view, quite rightly - will resent the details of their single farm payment being posted over the internet because of the distorted perception of free hand-outs which it creates.
The reality, of course, is that for most the single farm payment is in fact subsidising our cheap food policy.
Take the beef sector.
A task-force report in my constituency demonstrates that in that small area beef producers are losing EUR 260 million per annum.
Only their single farm payment keeps them going by subsidising production.
So, when it is publicised that a farmer has received EUR 20 000, it misleads for there is no mention that at the same time he is losing EUR 40 000 or more in his production operation.
To be fair, publication should be accompanied by typical profit-and-loss statistics from the commodity sales in each sector.
<D>
(SV) Madam President, many, like me, are concerned about the growing anti-Semitism in Europe.
Over the weekend, a Davis Cup tennis match between Sweden and Israel was played in my home town of Malmö.
It was no ordinary match.
It was played without spectators because the local political leadership felt it could not guarantee security, a view that many of us have criticised.
There were demonstrations in connection with the match, one of which was very violent.
Certainly, it is legitimate to criticise the policies of the state of Israel, but this criticism must not turn into hatred towards Jews in general, in other words into anti-Semitism.
Survivors of the holocaust should not need to hear that people in Europe are chanting 'murderers, murderers' when there is a gathering to show support for the state of Israel.
In the aftermath of the war in Gaza, there were a number of attacks on Jewish property and Jewish interests, including in my home town.
All democratic forces must be extremely clear on this matter.
Europe has a terrible history and this must never happen again.
<D>
(PL) Mr President, it would appear that all agreements reached in Lisbon are doomed.
The Lisbon Strategy and the Lisbon Treaty have both ended in a fiasco.
Last week Ireland rejected the Lisbon Treaty in a referendum.
This means the document is now dead.
The forthcoming summit will have to determine whether there is any hope of reviving the Treaty.
The European Parliament should send out a clear signal that it accepts the rules of democracy even though some Members may be unhappy with the outcome.
Insulting and coercing the people of Ireland is unacceptable.
One way of exerting acceptable pressure would be to continue the process of ratifying the Treaty in other countries.
The extreme and irresponsible comments raising the possibility of excluding such a supposedly arrogant country from the Union are cause for alarm.
We hope that the European Council will consider a new and more democratic formula for the European Union.
<D>
The next item is Question Time (B6-0382/2007)
We are already starting late so I will ask colleagues to keep to the time and I would invite you as we did on the previous occasion to please come to the front of the Hemicycle.
Please come to the front.
Nobody is going to tell you off for sitting in other people's seats!
It will make it much more friendly and more interactive if you all come to the front.
The following questions are addressed to the Commission.
Part one
Subject: Effects of the value of the euro on competitive tourism
Given that the increased value of the euro has led to a loss of competitiveness for Europe's tourist industry, what measures is the Commission planning to strengthen the industry and uphold Europe's standing as a tourist destination?
<D>
(EL) Madam President, let me mention the Sterckx report on vessel traffic monitoring and congratulate both Mr Sterckx himself and the Council Presidency on the good progress made in consultations.
At this second reading, the most important point for me is the provision made for vessels in distress to be accepted at designated ports of refuge.
Many accidents causing environmental disasters could have ended very differently had suitable refuge been offered at the right moment.
In order to reach agreement with the Council, there was, on the one hand, a need for an independent committee to take decisions on places of refuge.
On the other hand, it was necessary to agree on a satisfactory system of compensation for ports of refuge in the event of any consequences.
A balanced agreement here is a self-evident requirement.
There has also been a favourable development as regards the Automatic Identification System (AIS) within the scope of the SafeSeaNet.
To conclude, let me repeat here that shipping in some Member States contributes substantially to GDP.
As an industry it has a worldwide influence.
For this reason, efforts by the EU to make the seas a safe environment for people and for the ecological system must apply to everyone, not just to EU vessels.
There should be no unfair competition at the expense of European shipping.
<D>
rapporteur. - (DE)
Mr President, it has in fact been fun.
In terms of content, it is an important report, but I did not want to comment on it now.
We have not had any discussion, so it was agreed that I should comment briefly.
This report concerns the codecision-making procedure.
We had disputes with the Council on comitology procedure.
In the codecision procedure we quite naturally wanted - as you negotiated - controls in the regulatory procedure we wanted Parliament to be able to intervene in the event of a change to the administrative procedures.
The Council wanted to refuse us this.
We have had a few altercations with the Council but have held sway in the end.
If the Treaty, which was once called the Constitution, enters into force, there will have to be a further revision of the comitology procedure.
We shall then have to ensure that what the Council has already been practising does not happen again and that we basically do not lose influence here.
I say this so that the groups will also occupy themselves with this matter.
<D>
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, various figures have been quoted this evening, and in the report by Mr Foglietta.
I would like to point out that behind these cold statistics there are, first and foremost, human tragedies.
I was head of a psychiatric hospital for some years and many of our patients were alcohol-dependent.
Paragraph 26 of the report states that we need to know the causes.
We have not talked enough about that this evening.
If we want to decide on the right action to be taken with young people, old people, men and women, we have to know the causes.
I am therefore urging that, in any action that is taken, more research is done in each of the Member States and in the European Union as a whole to find out more about why these young people feel the need to drink to excess.
Why, too, do old people, isolated at home, drink too much?
Why do men drink at work?
Until we have found out the real reasons for this over-consumption, we shall not be able to provide proper answers.
<D>
The Roma struggle with discrimination in Europe on a systematic basis and have to fight exclusion, violations of their human rights and stigmatisation.
By voting for binding EU minimum standards today, I hope that the 10-12 million Roma will have better access to jobs, education, housing and healthcare.
It is a positive that the report calls for the best measures to be sought in collaboration with the stakeholders.
The report further highlights the primordial role of regional policy.
The Member States, after all, do have access to funds to assist the Roma with integration, but barely use that money.
It is thus up to the Member States to face up to their responsibility.
Another positive in this report is the idea that the Commission will have to introduce award criteria in favour of compliant Member States and penalties for non-compliance.
The only minus point is the reference to the Roma's 'prolonged dependence' on the social welfare system.
This is a very conservative, preconceived opinion that marginalises the Roma community once again.
I hope that the Commission integrates this report into its own proposal, which is likely to be presented on 5 April.
It is scheduled to be adopted by the Council before the summer.
The integration of the Roma is one of the priorities of the Hungarian Presidency.
<D>
Mr President, this directive is part of the defence package, the context of which is, and I quote, 'the strategy for a stronger and more competitive European defence industry'.
The principal guideline, as with so many things, is the free market for defence-related products too, in other words weapons, and weapons are for killing and waging war.
The aim of the directive is to improve the efficiency and competitiveness of the arms industry in the EU.
Mr Swoboda spoke plainly in the previous debate.
He said that we need better initial conditions for the European arms industry in view of the competition, in particular from the United States.
In 2005, the EU Member States jointly became for the first time the top arms exporter in the world.
Of these exports, 70% come from the four large nations of France, Germany, the United Kingdom and Italy.
The main importer states are those of the Middle East.
Our concern should not be for a more efficient arms industry, but rather for disarmament, and unlike the efficiency of the arms industry, for this there is no directive.
It is very clear what this is really all about.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - (SK) I have already explained the essence of the Commission's mission in my introduction and I can only confirm once again that we are both ready and willing, which is also a factor.
If the European Commission is willing to assist in this process, then I have already mentioned the next stages, which would involve completing studies of various methods and mechanisms of Member States in this area and submitting the awaited report next year.
However, I also have something to add which is rather at the margins of the debate.
Some speakers have made the point that it is the 20th anniversary of the collapse of Communism, the fall of the Berlin Wall and of the Iron Curtain in Europe and that a lot of time has passed.
In my opinion it is never too late and it would be remiss of this Parliament, this recently expanded Parliament, not to make a statement about the crimes of totalitarian Communism and not to initiate a discussion, because this is an experience that many people have brought to this place and indeed a majority of those in the debate were from the new Member States.
I too lived most of my life under the totalitarian system in Czechoslovakia and it is from the personal and general experience of all concerned that we should create a European memory, a European fellowship, and at the same time bolster the processes which prevent the return of totalitarianism and the trivialisation and denial of its crimes, or denial of the truth.
The denial of these crimes actually amounts to a relativisation not only of the truth but also of ethics and morality, leading to further and further problems and to the idea that eliminating people means eliminating the problem.
The idea that problems can be eliminated by eliminating people is one of the principles of Stalinism.
I view the expansion of the EU in a broader sense and precisely for that reason I am able to identify the different forms of totalitarianism that have been mentioned, the different forms in different countries.
We have a responsibility to identify them, to remember and to take adequate steps from the standpoint of restitution, rehabilitation, establishing justice, upholding the supremacy of truth, respect for human dignity and everything else that stands for freedom and democracy.
I would also like to say that we often feel as if threats come from far away and from outside, and that the dividing lines of today's world have nothing to do with religion or civilisation or culture, but rather with respect for life and human beings on the one hand (defined through human rights) and fanaticism of whatever kind on the other.
There are many different kinds of fanaticism.
We are familiar with them even in the world of today and that is precisely why the education mentioned by Alexander Vondra is so important, so that both the young and also the not-so-young will be able to distinguish human respect from extremism, populism, nationalism or fanaticism in any of its many different forms.
I would like to end by stressing that the European Commission genuinely supports this process and that it will be looking for ways to assist it.
This debate is just one step but other matters will follow.
We must do much more at the Member State level.
I would also like to end by saying that today's expansion of the EU is possible thanks to the sacrifice of many people and that it has not happened through some kind of automated process.
Neither a united Europe, nor democracy, nor freedom nor the legal state came into being automatically but instead as a result of enormous efforts and frequent bloodshed.
We must remember this.
I would finally like to end with what was said by - I think - Mr Tunne Kelam about the expansion of the Union involving not only geography, markets and numbers of countries but also an expansion of awareness, an expansion of memory and an expansion of respect and responsibility.
If we can include this in the process that we are now celebrating, the five years since expansion, then we will be ready for further processes and for the future.
If we fail to include it then the path will be much more difficult.
Thank you very much and my best wishes for an expansion not only of memory but also of responsibility.
<D>
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Mr President, in the run-up to the coming summit, the key assumption for my Group remains that Russia and the European Union have a number of important interests in common and, despite our many differences of opinion, the European Union should continue to operate on the basis of that assumption during the coming summit.
Russia and Europe need each other to tackle problems in Europe, but they especially need each other for tackling major international issues.
Sustainable security in Europe is only possible in cooperation with Russia.
For these reasons we, my Group and I, have always supported the strategic partnership with Russia.
There is a very full agenda for this summit and the Commissioner and the representative of the Presidency have already spoken about this.
All the same we hope that at some point there will be some movement on the question of the negotiating mandate for the new partnership and cooperation agreement.
We hope that a new Polish Government will be able to cooperate with Moscow better and as a result perhaps create some room for progress.
The energy relationship is extremely important and we also think that the starting point has to be reciprocity, but we do have to realise that we are dealing with a form of mutual independence here that we should try to manage better together.
We also want more cooperation in the Black Sea area, and we hope that issues such as Transnistria and Georgia will also be discussed at this summit.
Previous speakers have already mentioned the state of democracy in Russia and, of course, that is not something that can be left out of the discussion.
We are also concerned about the run-up to the Duma elections.
We also want the campaigns to be free and fair, and that all parties have an equal chance to have their say.
That is why it is so important that we press the issue of observers in Moscow: not only observers on the actual election day, but also observers during the campaign in the run-up to the elections.
We all know how important it is to be able to form a proper judgement of the elections; a country that has ambitions to hold the presidency of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe really should also be able and willing to work with the OSCE when it comes to observing the elections.
Finally, and I reiterate what I said at the beginning, we should continue to be critical towards Russia; critical when it comes to human rights and democracy, but we should not polarise things unnecessarily.
Our starting point should still be to be a good neighbour, to cooperate, and to try to tackle issues in Europe together and not to constantly make an issue of things.
<D>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are aware of the structural causes of the crisis in the automotive sector and its subcontractors.
This sector, as was the case for agriculture and textiles, is suffering social, environmental and tax relocations and dumping.
What are we going to do when the Americans, as the dollar is falling, sell their gas-guzzling, subsidised and highly promoted 4x4s on our market, which is also under siege from bottom-of-the-range vehicles from Turkey, India and China?
There is a solution.
We must re-establish the common external tariffs abolished by the Maastricht Agreements.
Only compensatory duties at the borders of the European Union can re-establish a genuine and fair international exchange.
Let us dare to do what common sense dictates before it is too late.
However, as you know, Protocol 27 and Article 63 of the Treaty of Lisbon strictly prohibit any customs protection of the European market.
Ladies and gentlemen, let us be consistent.
Let us no longer cherish causes which are so detrimental to us.
Let us finally bury this damaging treaty and stop playing at pyromaniac firefighters.
<D>
(RO) I wish to express my support for Mr Salafranca's report.
I believe that once the Global Agreement has been implemented, we must move to a higher historic level in the strategic partnership between the European Union and Mexico.
This partnership has become necessary, bearing in mind not only Mexico's important role on the global political and economic stage, but also its very close economic ties with the European Union.
Mexico has a population of more than 100 million, is the tenth-largest economic power in the world and is a member of the G20 Group.
Against the backdrop of global challenges such as the economic crisis and global warming, cooperation with Mexico will prove to be beneficial.
It goes without saying that we want the new partnership to formalise annual summits between the European Union and Mexico, based on the model used for high-level meetings featuring in the European Union's relations with other strategic partners.
We must also support the parliamentary dimension of this partnership through the EU-Mexico Joint Parliamentary Committee and the EuroLat Assembly, which have played a particularly beneficial role in recent years.
Given that it is the European Year of Creativity and Innovation, I think that we must focus greater attention on cooperation between the European Union and Mexico in the fields of research, culture and education, as well as scientific and student mobility.
Mexicans are the largest Spanish-speaking population in the world and share common cultural values with Europeans, which includes close ties with Romania's cultural heritage, based on their Latin legacy.
For example, an exhibition staged in July 2005 at the Romanian Peasant Museum in Bucharest demonstrated the astounding similarity between Mexican popular art and numerous creative works of Romanian popular art.
I feel that the European Union's institutions should tap to a greater extent and on a constant basis the potential which culture, education and art offer in terms of bringing peoples closer together.
Last but not least, I think that this strategic partnership's contribution should also include guaranteeing the safety of European citizens who travel to Mexico.
Mexico offers exceptional tourism potential, has magnificent historical cultural treasures and is also a favourite destination of many Europeans.
However, they must not be put in danger because of the crime and corruption which are evident in certain regions of the country.
The battle against crime may become more effective through trilateral cooperation between Mexico, the European Union and the United States.
<D>
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (DA) Mr President, all legislative bodies must be subject to scrutiny at all times and must also be prepared, as we are, to carry out self-monitoring.
I fear, though, that the self-monitoring in the present report goes too far; I would go so far as to call it self-censorship.
If this report is adopted in its original form, it will mean Parliament itself proposing to restrict the right of its Members to put relevant questions to the Council and the Commission.
This of course makes sense in itself, but the report also states that it is up to the President to decide whether the respective question may be put.
Thus the President of Parliament is to decide which questions it is appropriate to put to the other EU institutions.
We are thus introducing additional self-censorship and, on top of that, permitting the President of Parliament to exercise censorship too.
I should like to remind the House that we are the only directly elected body, and thus have a particular obligation.
Our task is to exercise parliamentary control, and so we cannot on any account impose self-censorship, which is open to abuse.
Of course, we all have a moral obligation not to waste any institution's time with irrelevant questions, but we cannot accept the setting of 'objective criteria' for relevance.
There are no such things as objective criteria in politics and, if we set them, we risk them being abused.
<D>
The European Commission's proposal was very positive and it was improved by the respective changes introduced by Parliament, namely:
that the Commission (Eurostat) receive an appropriate competence framework, adequate staffing and as much independence as possible;
harmonisation of statistical data collection;
standardising of statistical and budgetary information supplied by the Member States;
elaborating sanctions within the framework of the Stability and Growth Pact in relation to the submission of misrepresented macro-economic statistics by Member States.
I therefore voted in favour.
<D>
in writing. - (FR) In the Community budget for 2009, we, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, proposed and obtained the adoption of a preparatory action for developing social tourism in Europe.
This project responds to the finding that many citizens are prevented from travelling for economic reasons and that this inequality needs to be corrected by guaranteeing everyone access to holidays.
However, it is also useful in terms of territorial planning and local development.
By combining social mixing with local development and by providing access to members of the public for whom going on holiday is difficult, social tourism makes the tourism sector more profitable.
It therefore provides opportunities to develop off-season tourism, particularly in regions in which this sector is highly seasonal, and encourages the creation of more permanent-type jobs in this economic sector.
Thus, social and community tourism illustrates that there is indeed an intermediate sector between the leisure market and the non-creditworthy economy and that economic relevance is not incompatible with providing access to as many people as possible.
The sector also helps to strengthen European citizenship by means of exchanges between European citizens.
This just shows how important this sector is, in terms both of economic returns and of public resources.
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, I would like to thank the Commissioner, both for giving up her evening to come and join us in this packed House, but also for bringing the message that she has brought.
It is an important Green Paper and it should start a major discussion within this Parliament and beyond.
She raised one or two questions during her submission just now, including her question about why more nurses and doctors are not coming forward.
If I may say so, I think that is half the question.
The other half is why so many are leaving.
The key to this will be to find ways of recruiting and retaining healthcare professionals.
That goes particularly, perhaps, for nurses, but also for doctors and for other therapists and so on.
I think we have to look at the career structures that we provide.
We have to see how promotion is seen as a potential.
We have to cut down some of the barriers within and between the professions.
We have to ensure that the work environment is pleasant.
It is going to be tough but it can be comfortable as well.
We have to make sure that research facilities are available in Europe so we do not lose people abroad.
Perhaps, above all, we have to listen to the sharp-end professionals.
Too often - I know from when I have been in government and you know as a Commissioner - we listen to the top people and we do not go down to the beds and listen to the nurses and the doctors who are actually dealing on the ground.
If we did more of that, then perhaps we would get more of our policy right.
I, of course, want to refer - as the Commissioner has referred - to my report, the Parliament's consideration of cross-border health.
We said right from the beginning that important with that were the two measures that were not coming at the same time.
One of them, of course, was patient safety and we do have a measure that has sped its way on the fast track to join us.
This one is somewhat behind.
It concerns the health professionals.
We do need to have the health professionals providing that service - that back-up - to cross-border health to enable patients to move safely and with confidence.
Indeed, standing here in Strasbourg, we think of the Strasbourg, Liège, Luxembourg example of where the reference network concept may be of great value in terms of both patients and training and research.
The Commissioner has referred to the movement of health professionals, and we need to look at ways of making that a reality without endangering patient safety.
I think that certainly includes the issue of language tests, which are not an obstacle but must be a protective measure for patients.
She has referred to the recognition of qualifications.
That clearly is important, whether you are treated at home by an incoming doctor, or you are going abroad to meet a local doctor there.
There are some professions - and chiropractice is one - where you have recognition in some countries and not in others.
We need to look at ways of bringing those ancillary health professionals into the centre of our planning.
We also, of course, need to be sure we have patient safety in terms of doctors who are disciplined or struck off - doctors, nurses, any health professionals - and in my report, I call for this to be facilitated by the Commission.
I think that is something we need to look at more.
The Commissioner rightly referred to the brain drain.
It is tragic that we are not providing enough health professionals but go and grab them from the countries that can least afford it.
If you look at the figures, we see, on average, 1 in 4 doctors and 1 nurse in 20 has trained in Africa and is working in OECD countries.
It is partly that we as countries pinch them and it is partly our NGOs who also use them and recruit them in the country concerned, pay them more than they would be paid in their own countries.
Therefore, they do not go back to work there.
All those things are important, Commissioner.
We need to look at the safety of health professionals.
We need to put needle-stick injuries and hospital acquired infections on our agenda, as well as assaults on staff.
We know from talking to midwives recently about the difficulty of getting professional indemnity insurance.
Those are some of the issues that I hope will be to the forefront in our discussions on this very welcome Green Paper.
<D>
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, according to the US intelligence report, the situation has changed.
What is needed now is a moratorium on the nuclear issue.
The case must be diverted away from the UN Security Council and back to the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran has a very vibrant civil society, in spite of all the repressive measures against groups such as the trade unions.
There are intolerable occurrences, such as the rejection of candidates for election to the Majlis, but I am strongly opposed to tighter sanctions.
They would be counterproductive, particularly for the democratic opposition.
We are still hearing threats of war against Iran, especially from the United States.
My group is very firmly against any threat of war and the preparation of any war plans.
Mr Solana, in the British Guardian newspaper, Robert Cooper, a member of your staff, is quoted as saying the following in connection with the recently mooted manifesto for a new NATO: 'Maybe we are going to use nuclear weapons before anyone else, but I'd be wary of saying it out loud'.
Does this statement relate to the situation in Iran, Mr Solana, and when are you going to dissociate yourself from it?
Let me repeat: negotiation with Iran, not escalation and war.
<D>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank my fellow Members, the Commissioner and the Presidency for their participation in this discussion which, as Commissioner Verheugen said, does not end here.
Just a few points quickly.
I would like to comment on the issue of defining priorities, which Commissioner Verheugen spoke about.
I believe this could actually be a risky exercise.
However, it has never really been done until now.
I have always been rather sceptical about the possibility of really defining priorities.
Anyway, if you really want to go along this route, take the risk of being transparent, and why not even debate these priorities?
Otherwise the suspicion could take root that the priorities have been chosen because you want to get rid of the inconvenient infringements.
I do not think this would be a good thing.
The second comment is that despite the fact that the Commission denies that it needs more resources, particularly human resources, to deal with infringements, the reality is that in almost all the meetings I have had with your fellow Commissioners, everyone has told me that they do not have sufficient resources, sufficient people, to deal with this matter.
In the debate the question came up of the number of infringements in the new Member States, and what the Commissioner and the Presidency said is probably true.
However, we should also know that, for example, on environmental matters, there are only two or perhaps three officials dealing with all ten of the new Member States, so obviously there is certainly a human resources problem.
Lastly, the issue of Parliament's role.
We are discussing internally various ways of making our role as co-legislators more effective, by following up the application of the directives we approve.
I believe there are two things we absolutely must do: the first is decisively, through a political decision, to strengthen the role of the Committee on Petitions, which as Mrs Wallis said, is our window on the world; the second is that we should systematically organise application sessions, which do, however, require the open cooperation of the Commission.
Because if we organise sessions where we discuss the application of directives and the Commission official who attends remains silent or tells us things that are of little interest - perhaps because he cannot say what we really want to know - then the whole exercise becomes pointless.
Anyway, thank you and we will undoubtedly speak about this again.
<D>
At the meeting of the ministers of NATO member states in October 2008, General John Craddock, commander of the NATO forces in Europe, stated that Russia's military action in Georgia prompted NATO to revise its basic assumption concerning the security of its member states.
Does this statement still hold true now, after the Lisbon Summit?
The agreement with Russia is an expedient political step, which could serve the reinforcement of our security.
However, it inevitably raises serious moral and strategic questions as well.
Does NATO intend to yield, for the sake of cooperation, the representation and protection of the democratic ideas on which the Euro-Atlantic alliance is based, and which are in sharp contrast to the Russian concept of democracy on several points?
It is perhaps unnecessary to give a separate reminder of the intimidation and abuse of people, and the unclear details of the deaths of journalists and lawyers in Russia.
It would also be hard not to interpret Russia's recent nomination of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange for the Nobel Prize for Peace as a provocative gesture.
Will it lessen the chances of countries intending to join NATO if Russia does not approve of their future membership?
We are faced with the question whether NATO leaders are taking into consideration the vulnerability of certain member states, as well as their open and unsettled issues with Russia that exist to this day.
The historic direction of peace-making and agreement must at any rate be welcomed.
However, we must clearly recognise the historic responsibility of NATO in what major power it legitimises as a consequence of the agreement concluded for the missile defence programme, and what it will firmly oppose, true to our common European values.
<D>
(ET) Ladies and gentlemen, personal data is sensitive information which must be handled extremely carefully.
There must be no gaps in data protection; it must work properly.
That is precisely the aim of the amendments tabled by the rapporteur to the proposal for the draft Council Framework Decision on the protection of personal data processed in the framework of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters.
I also congratulate the rapporteur on the work he has done.
The Framework Decision will have a considerable impact on one of the basic rights of European Union citizens: the right to privacy.
Since the European Parliament has always resolutely supported a strong, protective Framework Decision which would make a high level of data protection possible, the Council should give serious consideration to Parliament's amendments.
Exchange of personal data should be regulated by a standard code of practice which is easy to understand; its role must be to provide reliable protection which guarantees respect for people's basic rights.
Paramount importance must be given to how personal data are in fact to be used.
The processing of personal data which reveal a person's racial or ethnic background, political views, religious or philosophical convictions, membership of professional bodies, state of health or sexuality must be regulated as strictly as pharmacies are.
It must not be restricted only by a clause saying that it is permitted when essential and that safeguards are sufficiently guaranteed - this is too general, exceptions must be spelled out.
Access to personal data and disclosure of such data must take place within the law, security must be fully guaranteed.
To that end we need a watertight, specific, protective Framework Decision and a control system.
Our role is to safeguard our citizens' basic rights and at the same time to discourage terrorism.
Let us do both with utmost care.
<D>
Madam President, to begin with I would like to congratulate Poul Nyrup Rasmussen for his preparation of the report based on such profound analyses and excellent knowledge of the financial markets.
Both types of alternative financial instruments that we are discussing have an increasing share of assets in the global market and participate in creating new jobs.
However, the most important thing in the face of the financial crisis we have lately been observing with great anxiety and unsuccessfully trying to fight is to ensure financial stability.
In my opinion, the most efficient way to increase not only financial stability, but also fair competition between participants in the market, is to enhance supervision and transparency at the appropriate levels without doing any harm to the model based on innovative market strategies.
Some norms concerning the financial markets that have a direct and indirect application to hedge funds and private equity do exist above the national and European level.
Nevertheless, we should strive for the coherent, non-discriminatory and consistent implementation and application of those juridical regulations.
For this reason, I fully agree with the recommendations of the European Parliament, directed at the Commission, for increased activity and submission of the appropriate legislative proposals.
<D>
(FR) Mr President, what role must Europe play in countries whose regimes are being confronted by the people, but whose leaders remain deaf to repeated calls for more democracy, real structural reforms and fairer development?
That is the question being put to us.
For me, there is an initial response.
It is an urgent one.
The Union must flex its muscles by using the entire arsenal of sanctions available to it to put a stop to the repression and to obtain the immediate release of political prisoners and journalists.
It must support the introduction of an independent commission for an inquiry into the acts committed and call for a special session of the Human Rights Council.
In the medium term, I think that we must look again in depth at our relations with these countries.
The European Union must, from now on, show that it is firmly on the side of public opinion, on the side of the people and not of those in power.
To this end, the Union must establish and conduct a permanent dialogue with all the forces of civil society, with all those who want to support democracy as well as the leaders of the opposition movements.
This is, therefore, a profound change ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
<D>
in writing. - (PL) Whilst not undervaluing the importance of towns and large conurbations, it is important to keep in mind that the major part of European social and economic life takes place in rural areas.
That is why I was delighted to welcome the report by Mrs Klaß on the situation of women in rural areas.
Our debate on this subject dovetails appropriately with the general debate linked to the celebration of International Women's Day.
I support the main idea contained in this report, namely that the development of rural areas cannot be based exclusively on agriculture.
The EU's agricultural policy aims to ensure genuine sustainable development for rural areas, thus providing the local population, women included, with additional opportunities to better develop their potential.
This involves women assuming a more important role in the life of local communities, playing their part in the creation of new enterprises and becoming involved in the developing service sector.
It should be strongly emphasised that the governing principle that should dominate when it comes to defining the operation of rural areas is equality of opportunity between men and women.
One of the ways in which this may be assessed is in terms of women's access to the labour market.
Unfortunately, female employment indicators are lowest in rural areas, because women who work on farms are not always counted as part of the labour force.
Such women also have fewer opportunities for paid jobs than women in urban areas.
This unfavourable situation can only be remedied by changing the mentality of the local population and through the new financial incentives the EU is making available precisely to rural areas.
<D>
(BG) It is a challenge for a representative of Bulgaria, one of the newest EU Member States, to take part in the adoption of the 2008 budget as a full member.
This has become possible thanks to the enlargement policy pursued by the European Union and supported also through its budgetary policy.
I support the report and congratulate the rapporteurs and coordinators on the agreement they have reached with regard to the budget and its changes.
The draft 2008 budget, in its Sustainable Growth part, makes it possible even for the newest EU Member States to achieve the goals facing them in connection with their membership.
The operational programmes within the framework of the Structural Funds ensure high quality and qualifications of human resources, competitiveness, improvement of the infrastructure, strengthening of the administrative capacity in transport, the environment, etc.
Regrettably, the available resources are less than what is needed.
I wish to express my support also for the strategic increase of payments to the Structural Funds, the Social and Cohesion Funds, because this will enable them to expand the operational programmes and their capabilities.
I support also the 30-percent reserve for the administrative expenditures line because I believe this is a way to ensure efficiency of expenditures and control over spending.
The draft 2008 budget pays attention also to the new regions that have joined the EU.
In the Black Sea Region, these are Bulgaria and Romania which are also borders of the European Union.
The policy of the EU and the national governments is aimed at transforming the region into an area of security, stability and goodneighbourliness.
The region needs improvement of the infrastructure, more investment, and adequate measures to protect the environment because of its high industrialisation and its transformation into a transfer zone for raw materials in the energy sector.
The European Union with its policy and financing should guarantee both the environmental security and the stability and security of energy supplies to Europe..
The Black Sea Monitoring and the Framework Programme for the Black Sea Development is a pilot project which I am confident that the European Parliament will support; it is a right step towards good development of the Black Sea region and towards integration of the citizens of the Black Sea region into the EU membership policy.
<D>
(HU) Thank you very much, Madam President.
Every decent person was shocked by last week's natural disaster in the Far East.
It is natural that the attention of the world should be centred on these countries.
China is very much in the focus of public attention at present: the Olympic Games this summer, the Chinese Premier's visit to Taiwan, events in Tibet, the Dalai Lama's tour of Europe and how it was received, the visit to China by the European Commission; all these things have contributed to focusing attention on China.
Now is not the time, however, to speak about boycotts or about Tibet.
The earthquake, which had a magnitude of 8.0 and left the Sichuan plateau in ruins, caused the deaths of 50 000 people and rendered millions of survivors homeless, not to mention the economic damage caused.
This is why I am asking every European Union institution to make sure that we give all the human assistance we can and make humanitarian aid available to those affected by the disaster for as long as it is needed.
Let us thank the rescue teams and aid organisations for their help; they worked around the clock to improve the situation of the people living in the region, and let us assure the Chinese people of our unconditional solidarity and sympathy.
Thank you very much.
<D>
President Jacques Chirac said that the most intolerable inequality is inequality in health.
That is why I voted in favour of this report, which focuses on health and therefore the protection of consumers.
Falsified medicinal products are a scourge that has long been ignored.
While developing countries are an obvious target, because the cost of legal medicines is often beyond the reach of the majority and the controls are scarcely effective if not indeed non-existent, we are also seeing more and more falsified medicines entering the EU, particularly via the Internet.
This is a growing threat to public health and to safety in general, and it exists throughout the world.
The EU must remain vigilant and energetically pursue a purposeful policy against this unacceptable corruption.
At present, it is difficult to put a figure on its economic implications, as production has become more industrialised.
This is a moral and ethical problem that undermines the credibility and efficacy of health systems.
For this reason, the fight against falsified medicines should appeal to the conscience of political leaders around the world.
<D>
in writing. - I voted in favour of the 'Single market for Europeans' report.
It is the duty of the European institutions to facilitate a highly developed, highly competitive social market economy that will seek to create full employment and stimulate social progress.
I believe that the Single Market is one of the key drivers for European growth.
Market fatigue is a cause for concern and this must be examined in detail.
Most importantly, this report reaffirms citizens' fundamental social rights in the field of collective action, labour law, employment protection and industrial restructuring in line with primary European law.
I am in favour of the short-term strategies suggested in this report, including the enhancement of European market surveillance, the creation of a single integrated mortgage market and the removal of tax obstacles and double taxation.
Implementing a sound e-commerce policy will increase citizens' and consumers' confidence when shopping online.
I would like to also welcome the proposal to create an action plan to reduce illegal counterfeiting of goods.
This will contribute to a rapid return to growth in the goods sector.
<D>
rapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner Vassiliou, Commissioner Dimas, ladies and gentlemen, today we have the result of many discussions and negotiations, which were, at times, conducted with great emotion, and we will have the opportunity to vote on this tomorrow.
We have not made it easy for ourselves.
We have struggled to find the right solutions in our negotiations with the Council and with the Commission.
We have established that science does not always point us in the right direction with clear findings.
Further scientific support will be necessary in order to analyse the effects of this new legislation.
First of all, therefore, sincere thanks to all those who contributed to this positive result with constructive proposals, my fellow members here in Parliament, the European Commission, the French Presidency of the Council - it is a pity that the Czech Presidency of the Council is not here this evening - but thanks also to the staff.
With the current Directive on the Sustainable Use of Plant Protection Products we are taking a giant step towards more commonality in European environmental and consumer protection.
Sustainability as the overall concept for European agriculture will guarantee healthy food and a healthy environment.
For the first time, the handling of plant protection products will be harmonised at European level.
The basic principle 'as much as necessary, as little as possible' assumes comprehensive, sound knowledge.
Plant protection products are, in fact, medicine for plants.
They must be used correctly in order to be effective - the right product and the right dosage at the right time.
This also includes the consideration as to whether chemical plant protection is necessary or whether mechanical measures would be better.
The selection of the best technology and tested application equipment will protect the environment and the user and contribute to the success of the operation through good harvests.
The Member States will establish measures in their national action plans to reduce the use of plant protection products.
Risk reduction is the primary objective.
The use of the general basic principles of integrated plant protection will become mandatory for the entire European Union from 2014.
Compliance with the stipulations of the Water Framework Directive is top priority.
The Member States will establish buffer zones adjacent to bodies of water, which must be adapted to the conditions of the soil properties and geographical circumstances.
The use of plant protection products by local authorities and in protected areas will be minimised or stopped, if necessary.
There are regulations for checking equipment and regular maintenance intervals will be set.
Risk reduction means that professional users must obtain sound and ongoing training in the use of plant protection products.
Private users, who have no specific training and can cause damage in private gardens through incorrect usage, must be informed by well-trained salespersons on the use and risks when purchasing plant protection products.
This directive will mean that previously differing regulations in the individual Member States will be adjusted to a high, common level.
The proposed measures will benefit the environment, consumers and users.
Identical conditions throughout the European Union will guarantee identical safety standards and identical production conditions.
Substances that are proven to be detrimental to health will not be licensed, on that we are in agreement.
However, a ban must be based on scientifically sound findings and not on political dogmas.
Exposure must also be taken into consideration because with pesticides, like many things in life, it is the dosage that creates the poison hazard.
A headache tablet is a blessing, but if you take 20 it becomes dangerous, even life-threatening.
We have reached a good compromise.
It will harmonise the environment and economic policy and I hope that we can emphasise our requirements in a unanimous vote tomorrow.
I will allow myself just one more technical point, which is to say that an error has crept into Article 14 Paragraph 4.
Reference is made to the Internet portal mentioned in Article 4 Paragraph 3; but there is no Paragraph 3 in Article 4.
This should be rectified.
<D>
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, at this point, I can but offer my sincere thanks for the broad support for this proposal from all sides of the House.
What we have, of course, is a compromise, and there is always scope to want a little bit more in such cases.
I can also say that I, personally, and the Commission would have been prepared to go a step further.
What we have now is what we were able to achieve, however, and it represents a major step forward.
In particular, I would like to emphasise once again what Mrs Rühle said.
Politically speaking, the crucial thing, especially in this situation, is to improve European vehicles in areas that will be crucial in future.
One thing is quite clear, and that is that the crisis in demand is not just the result of the general economic conditions and the economic uncertainty but also has something to do with the fact that the vehicles that European manufacturers are offering have perhaps failed to meet the requirements of the European market in recent years where fuel consumption, environmental friendliness and safety are concerned.
That is why it is so important that this is now quickly rectified.
Please allow me to say something about the issue that Mrs Doyle mentioned.
I am aware that there is an erroneous interpretation of the requirements pertaining to type-approval in a number of Member States - as you have just quite correctly pointed out - but it is an erroneous interpretation, one which is not in line with the legal framework that is in place.
The Commission will ensure that the necessary clarifications are issued and that the negative consequences that you have highlighted, Mrs Doyle, will not occur.
<D>
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Goebbels is quite right that there is massive speculation in oil prices, and indeed Mr Borloo and Mr Piebalgs have said the same.
The Greens, the Socialists and the United Left have all tabled amendments aimed at ensuring that our resolution takes this issue into account and those on the Right who today applauded the idea of measures to combat wild speculation in the oil market - and I am delighted about that - will, I hope, be voting for our amendments tomorrow.
It would be ridiculous if this House were to vote for a resolution that did not deal with the subject of excessive speculation in the oil markets.
The second important matter is the social aspect.
We have to help the poorest members of our society to overcome this situation.
I for my part would recommend targeted aid.
It would be better to give poorer households EUR 100 than to float so-called good ideas such as reducing VAT.
This notion, so dear to Mr Sarkozy, will clearly be rejected tomorrow by Parliament, for we would rather side with Mr Borloo, who is for encouraging the bonus-malus system, by giving citizens access to services and appliances that consume less energy.
Let me just make two final remarks.
Firstly, we shall only be able to deal with the issue of the allocation fund by making progress in the area of energy management and renewables management.
I would therefore ask the Commissioner if the Commission is once again set on looking foolish by presenting a strategy document on energy and energy security that fails to deal with the issue of transportation?
In all the drafts that I have seen there is no mention of transportation.
This is ridiculous, for Europe is most heavily reliant on oil, not on gas, and there is nothing about this in your documents.
Now a final remark to Mr Borloo: today Coreper discussed renewable energies and I for my part no longer comprehend the French Presidency.
You are undermining things with the rendez-vous clause, including the 20% target.
Thankfully, this proposal was today rejected by the majority of the Member States.
I would therefore appeal directly to the French Presidency: stop jeopardising this directive, for it is a very important document.
<D>
author. - (ES) Mr President, in the light of events, I feel that the situation in Zimbabwe certainly deserves our consideration at this urgent sitting.
I therefore add my voice, how could I not, to the voices of those who have already condemned the violence on the part of government forces against opposition groups, journalists and human rights supporters
I also hope that this resolution will at least help to support those who are trying from inside and outside the country to restore democratic process to the situation.
However, there is one particular point to which I would like to draw attention and it concerns the famous case of the Chinese vessel An Yue Jiang, carrying 77 tonnes of arms and munitions destined for Zimbabwe, which was forced to leave the South African port of Durban after dockworkers refused to unload the cargo and a court ruled that the arms could not be transported through South Africa.
According to my information, the vessel is now seeking another port at which to offload its cargo, although it seems, in view of the opposition in the area to accepting the shipment, that the vessel might return to China without accomplishing its mission.
Once again, it is clear that the vessel should never have been allowed to sail and that all governments need to get together to devise an international treaty on arms transfers as soon as possible because, unfortunately, there are many places in the world like Zimbabwe, which should never be allowed to receive arms or munitions of any description.
Let this example act as a spur towards the negotiation of a forceful and legally binding ATT (Arms Trade Treaty), which so many NGOs in the IANSA network have been calling for for years, as indeed has this Parliament.
<D>
Relations between the European Union and Belarus depend on both parties.
If there is common good will, then dialogue will be possible, as will a suitable neighbourhood policy and an Eastern Partnership.
Partnerships cannot be built on prohibitions and orders, which is why I welcome the European Commission's recent initiative to improve relations with Belarus.
Objectively speaking, we must admit that Belarus has also done a lot to foster understanding.
Examples of this include registration of the 'For Freedom' movement, permission for the publication and distribution of opposition newspapers, and openness to the Eastern Partnership initiative.
The European Union has greater expectations.
There are, of course, good reasons for this.
However, there are also good reasons for many of Belarus' expectations.
There is a need for symmetry and understanding between the partners in many fields.
For example, since we are calling on the Belarusian authorities to stop issuing exit visas to their citizens, especially children and students, why does the European Union not take steps to simplify and liberalise visa procedures for the citizens of Belarus?
These problems are particularly important to those of us who live in border regions, which are linked by both cultural and family ties.
In addition to cultural matters and the issue of nationality, the economy and trans-border cooperation are also important.
Here, too, the Commission and the Council could, and should, do more.
<D>
(PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is not common for a single topic to combine, at the same time and in a positive way, the three very important issues of health, culture and economics.
The Mediterranean diet achieves this in full.
From the health perspective, it appears there are no remaining scientific doubts about the advantages to human health of a diet based on fresh and natural food.
As already mentioned here, this includes cereals, rice, legumes, nuts, fruit and vegetables, frequent consumption of fish, olive oil as the main dietary fat and moderate consumption of wine.
From a cultural point of view, the systems of production and the processing and consumption of these products are associated with ancestral techniques and traditions that go back further than Greco-Roman culture and that, in many respects, are still present in the practices, customs and techniques of the communities of the Mediterranean basin.
From the perspective of the economy, the activities connected, in particular, to the agriculture, fishing and rural tourism sectors, which are so important in preventing depopulation and maintaining the vitality of the rural and coastal zones, continue to have a very considerable socio-economic impact.
At the same time, and curiously in the case of agriculture, they represent the most competitive forms of production in the European Union, and have always benefited from the least financial support under the common agricultural policy.
For all of these reasons, the initiative of the Spanish authorities to have the Mediterranean diet recognised by UNESCO as Cultural Heritage of Humanity deserves to be warmly welcomed, and I think it is the duty and obligation of the European Union to do what it can to influence this decision, because it is not in the specific interests of one country or group of countries; it is in the interests of the whole Union.
<D>
(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, the Transatlantic Economic Dialogue comes in a context which is marked by a triple crisis: the global banking and financial crisis, to which we still cannot see an end, the crisis in food prices, and finally, the ongoing crisis in oil prices.
All these shocks have appeared against a general background of global warming and climate change, which calls for cycles to be reversed and certain dogmas on which we have based the prosperity of Western society to be challenged.
Could strengthening our transatlantic relations serve this objective?
I do believe so, though it will be difficult, complex and not without conflict.
This resolution sketches out a few responses that chime with the demands and aspirations of European and American public opinion.
Firstly, it is not a matter of lowering our sights merely to the creation of a transatlantic free trade area, but of making sure the development of our trade serves other more laudable objectives, which promote social and environmental standards.
From this point of view, the resolution we will be voting on tomorrow is well balanced.
It recognises that the so-called obstacles to trade between the European Union and the USA are often laws with a specific social, environmental, cultural or public health purpose, and that these obstacles cannot be removed without a democratic decision and positive legislative action to protect these objectives.
The text also encourages the European Union to draw inspiration from certain bilateral trade agreements signed by the USA, containing detailed provisions on labour law.
It is for these reasons in particular that I believe this resolution is useful for the transatlantic dialogue.
<D>
Madam President, I have been participating in debates in this House since the original Lisbon Strategy and I am also part of the Lisbon Coordination Group in this Parliament.
One of the things I have been consistently calling for is for the Commission to sharpen its focus on the Lisbon Strategy and set out a clearly defined list of priorities.
I do not think anybody has mentioned this so far or complimented the Commission on actually doing this.
We now have a Community Lisbon programme with 10 priority actions.
I have to say, somewhat to my regret, that, as a member of the group, I think Parliament's resolution has gone in entirely the other direction.
This resolution before us today seems to me to be rather more long-winded and ambiguous than previous ones.
I suspect the Commission will be disappointed, because I note in the Community Lisbon Strategy with its 10 priorities, which I am sure all of you have read, that one of the top demands from the Commission is as follows: 'It is essential that the European Parliament, the Council and the European Commission agree on the strategic reform objectives and actions'.
I certainly agree with that.
I hope that the Commission can extract that from this resolution, because I believe most of it is in there.
Nevertheless, I think that one of the lessons for our work with the Commission is that, for our next work on this strategy, we have to focus on these priority actions, because I am pleased to see that the Commission is going to work on these, keep them stable and move them forward.
Part of the problem we have is that we get piles of papers - different communications on different aspects of the strategies and revised priorities.
This set of revisions, this set of 10 priorities, is different from the ones we had last year.
Frankly, that is no way to move forward.
Last week, I participated as a rapporteur in the meeting with national parliaments.
I just want to echo what many colleagues have said: the action on Lisbon is shifting from here to the chambers of national parliaments, because that is where we need to engage them on delivering these 10 priority objectives, and that is something we need to reflect on as well.
I particularly welcome the Minister's attendance here to show the importance the Council attaches to it.
<D>
in writing. - (FR) I voted for the resolution that urges Turkey to accelerate the pace of its reforms.
We have to call on Turkey to do more: to ensure civilian control over the military; to have zero tolerance of torture; to provide protection for women and minority groups, and to recognise the Armenian genocide.
The handling of the Kurdish issue also has to be used as a criterion for assessing the reform process.
The report that we have voted on urges the Turkish Government to launch a political initiative aimed at finding a lasting settlement to the Kurdish problem.
It also deplores the violation of Iraq's territory, while at the same time, of course, condemning the violence perpetrated by the PKK.
This is not about targeting Turkey as such, it is about recalling that we cannot have double standards, that we cannot sell off cheaply the values that we hold dear.
It would also be disastrous to continue to ignore public opinion, which was again expressed in a poll carried out by Notre Europe before the Lisbon Summit.
The people of Europe are concerned about ill-prepared decisions on any future enlargement and about the EU's capacity to absorb any more countries after the huge wave of new accessions that took place between 2004 and 2007.
<D>
in writing. - (DE) I did not vote for the human rights report, for the following reasons:
1.
Human rights are inalienable, indivisible and universally applicable.
Nonetheless, social and economic rights, and the massive violation of these rights worldwide, barely feature in the report.
The fact that millions of people are deprived of their most basic rights, the fact that - partly as a result of the EU's highly problematical policies - they have less and less food available, and that hunger, disease and a lack of decent housing are their cruel reality, that many people have no access to education, and that workers' rights are being trampled under foot: all this is largely ignored.
2.
The report fails to make any mention of the human rights violations that are occurring in the EU itself and in which the EU is involved around the world, partly as a result of its military and armaments policy and its ever-expanding military missions.
Only the human rights violations taking place outside the EU are criticised; the EU's own omissions and responsibilities are ignored.
The internal and external effects of the EU's neoliberal policies, with their negative consequences for human and fundamental rights, are not mentioned in the report.
3.
The report adopts a highly selective approach to the voicing of criticism, as the choice of countries selected for criticism and the scope of this criticism demonstrate.
Human rights policy cannot be based on political exigencies, however, if it is to retain any credibility.

(FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this report proposes nothing more and nothing less than to give the European Police Office, Europol, a new status by modifying its existing legal bases.
Indeed, the intention is to replace the Europol Convention concluded in 1995 between the Member States with a Council decision converting the agency from an intergovernmental body into a European Union agency financed from the Community budget and applying the Staff Regulations of officials of the European Communities.
The reasons given for this radical change of status are the extension of the mandate of Europol's activities beyond just organised crime and the Member States' inability to meet these new and very extensive objectives adequately.
These objectives will obviously be better met at European Union level, the Council assures us.
But this is all smoke and mirrors.
The reality is that we are already engaged with the requirements and application of the Treaty of Lisbon, which transfers almost all of justice and home affairs policy to a qualified majority of the Council of Ministers.
Until now, these fields of judicial and police cooperation have required unanimity.
The reality is that our national and European leaders are in the process of imposing on us institutional reforms that all work towards a more deeply supranational and bureaucratic model.
It is these same reforms that are in the Treaty of Lisbon that were rejected by the French and Dutch in the referendums of May and June 2005.
The people have been duped, misled and treated with contempt.
Europe cannot be built contrary to its people and contrary to national realities, and it is high time that our pro-European political class realised this and finally left Europe to construct itself from the nations' and people's rights to identity, sovereignty, freedom and security.
<D>
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Vice-President, looking around this House I somehow have the impression that the occupants of the constitutional ivory tower have been invited to continue their discussions in the plenary sitting of this House.
That was not the agreement.
What had been agreed on was a major debate of the European Parliament on the consequences of the Treaty of Lisbon.
Would it not have been nice if this Parliament had discussed the treaty this morning at the same time as the Czech Senate and had made it clear to the citizens of the European Union that the treaty was the work of the European Parliament, starting with the Convention and continuing right through to the present day, that this reform had not been imposed by an EU of elites, but that it was a major piece of work resulting from a collaborative effort?
When something fails, my 15 years of experience tells me that the failure is usually down to governments and not to parliaments.
Now, we are all covered in scars and bedecked with decorations.
I am giving my last speech after 15 years.
We have come a long way.
It has been a great honour.
I was also invited - along with Mr Duff - to be a rapporteur for this House, both on the Charter of Fundamental Rights and on the Constitution.
I am bound to say - and I think I also speak for the other members of the Convention - that we always felt supported by the approval of the European Parliament.
We stuck our necks out, dared to have visions that provoked much shaking of heads, resistance on the part of governments, many a veto, almost the collapse of the Convention.
But there is, in fact, no denying that the driving force, the visionary force in this process was the parliaments.
As such it was also a first victory for the citizens of the European Union.
Allow me to, perhaps, take a look into the future.
We know what we all think of the progress made by this treaty.
When the Intergovernmental Conference attacked the results of the Convention, abolished the Legislative Council, re-introduced laws made by the Council and added on the third part - and all these things that really upset us today - I had the idea of a First Amendment of the Constitution in a far and distant future.
One of the important cardinal elements of this treaty is the European Parliament's right of initiative, its right to propose motions for a Convention to be formed to amend the Constitution.
And we have not yet come to the end of the road.
When we fought for our visions, we were often told in the Convention: 'Ah, you with your comparison to the Philadelphia Convention, Europe needs a major crisis.
Without a major crisis you will never manage to create a real European democracy, a real political community.
We really do need a major crisis'.
They were clearly thinking of the next hundred years.
But we have it.
We have this crisis.
And now, suddenly, the citizens are asking why we do not have any economic governance.
They are asking why we do not have a minimum of common European economic law, at least with regard to the key aspects of fiscal policy, corporate taxes and transaction taxes.
People are also asking for a social Europe.
Yes, we did not dismount from the barricades, the governments simply said Njet.
Today, the whole of Europe is asking where are the powers of the European Union to defend the social market economy, a fair distribution?
In the meantime billions of euros will be spent into the next generation.
And we have no democratic power, no legal basis to develop a social Europe.
Every day I am asked what the situation is with regard to military action in the name of Europe.
A couple of nation states are taking military action in the context of cabinet politics as practised in the 19th century.
Should we not reflect on the fact that this House has to agree before military action can take place in the name of Europe?
And the citizens' initiatives?
There too constitutional changes were excluded.
Why?
Why can there not be a Citizens' Initiative calling for the treaty to be amended and for the further development of the European Constitution?
I think there is still a long way to go.
The timidity and shyness of this Parliament before the Council is a huge obstacle.
(Heckling)
I believe we should be more militant.
I hope that this House will really claim the rights to which it is entitled under the Treaty of Lisbon with tremendous selfconfidence and with great loyalty to the citizens of the European Union, assert them and then consider how the whole thing can be developed a lot better towards a European democracy and a social order.
Mr President, I am not giving up on my dream.
(Heckling)
I am not giving up on my dream to enable my children and their children to at least say: "Vive la République d'Europe!”
(Applause)
<D>
rapporteur. - (FI) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the European Parliament has now to deliberate upon the Council's proposal for next year's budget.
Right at the start I wish to thank the country holding the presidency, Portugal, for its excellent and transparent cooperation.
It has worked splendidly in collaboration with the European Parliament and its Committee on Budgets, in particular.
The debate has gone extremely smoothly.
Although the Council's proposal gives cause for comment, the work of the Presidency gives us good reason to assume that we will achieve an excellent end result.
The Council's budget proposal is a frugal one.
Compared to the preliminary draft budget, commitment appropriations have been cut by EUR 717 million, with the margin for the multiannual financial framework at EUR 3.9 billion.
Payment appropriations have come in for an even bigger cut, having been reduced by EUR 2.1 billion, meaning they are a good EUR 10.3 billion under the financial framework, which is to say just 95% of the EU's GNI.
When we recall how, after long and hard talks, the financial framework was adopted only a year ago, we have to regard the level of payment appropriations, and these especially, as unrealistically low.
It is regrettable that budget headings 1a (competitiveness for growth and employment) and 1b (cohesion for growth and employment) should have been made the target of particularly drastic cuts.
In the first case payment appropriations have been reduced by more than EUR 500 million and in the second by EUR 498 million.
Both of these headings concern a key priority of the European Union, the Lisbon Strategy, one now made weaker by a cut of more than a billion euros.
There are also fundamental problems for the budget in connection with heading 1.
Last year the European Parliament warned the Council that financing for the European Galileo navigation system was too inadequate.
Now there is a shortfall of EUR 2.4 billion, because the private sector did not get involved.
Under its resolution, the European Parliament is supporting a project using Community funds coming out of the Union's budget.
This is the simplest procedure, the least bureaucratic and the most democratic.
Such a huge sum of money, EUR 400 million a year, is nevertheless impossible to find, given the current financial framework, and so we need a joint decision by Parliament and the Council.
We can rescue this important European project, but it will have to be done in the context of this budget procedure.
Another problem is the European Institute of Technology, the EIT.
If we do want to set it up it will have to be financed sustainably.
It cannot be based on hopes and assumptions, but needs realistic decisions.
The idea that the EIT would almost certainly receive cash out of EU programmes based on free competition is just a dream.
What if it were to come true, though?
That is why we need realistic solutions.
There is a special problem concerning next year's budget, and that relates to the Structural Funds, the Cohesion Fund and rural development funds.
Only a few of the Structural Funds' Operational Programmes have been approved.
Just 20% of the 335 Programmes under the European Regional Development Fund and Cohesion Fund have been approved, but the figure for the European Social Fund is just less than 10%.
Most worrying is the situation concerning the Rural Development Fund, where just two of the 96 Programmes have been approved.
In June the European Parliament and the Council adopted a declaration which focuses attention on this, and they promised to monitor the Commission's actions here.
Parliament for its own part promises to enforce this declaration.
Finally, I want to emphasise the importance of good management.
The European Parliament wants to promote activity-based management and budgeting.
We, together with the Council, passed a declaration which stresses the importance of a cost-benefit analysis and accountability when new agencies are being set up.
We need to insist on this.
The theme of next year's budget is the Budget for Results.
The purpose is to emphasise the notion that it is the appropriations that need to be used to achieve the desired results.
Management is not the main issue here: it is results.
I firmly believe that we, along with the Council and the Commission, will succeed in establishing such a budget for next year.
<D>
(PL) Mr President, I would like to express the hope that the Knowledge and Innovation Communities that make up the European Institute of Technology will be spread evenly across the European Union.
This is particularly important because the Institute should be an instrument that mobilises the whole of the Community uniformly, and should boost competitiveness and technological progress, with the corollary of economic development for all the European Union, not just the old Member States.
I would also like to use this opportunity to give my firm support to the Polish proposal to locate the offices of the Institute's Governing Board in Wrocław.
This is a rapidly developing city on the boundary between old and new Europe, on the borders of four states: Poland, Germany, Austria and the Czech Republic.
It is a city with some excellent higher education institutions and nearly 150 000 students.
Both the national authorities in Poland and the Wrocław local authorities, as well as the Polish academic world, are fully prepared to put this task into effect.
I would like to stress that locating the Institute's Governing Board and the Knowledge and Innovation Community in Wrocław will not in any way clash with the fundamental criterion for the EIT - the criterion of excellence; in fact quite the contrary.
Polish research and academia is at a high European level, and in many instances is leading the world.
The Institute must become an instrument that promotes higher levels of innovation throughout the European Union.
This is the only way for us to have a chance to meet the challenges of a global knowledge-based economy.
<D>
Mr President, thank you for clarifying that.
Greece joined the European Union in 1981 and membership has brought many benefits to that country, of which I am extremely fond.
Almost 30 years later, however, Macedonia naturally wants to join the European Union and share those same benefits.
It is therefore only right that Greece, as a neighbouring Balkan state, expresses its firm solidarity and works to help a small country like Macedonia to achieve its aspirations.
But because of its own province named Macedonia, Greece objects to the use of the name 'Republic of Macedonia' on its own, insisting instead on 'former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia', or FYROM.
For the sake of consistency, why does Greece not therefore also insist on calling Estonia the 'Former Soviet Republic of Estonia' as a formal title?
I therefore regret that Greece is now considering applying its veto to Macedonia's membership over this issue.
I fear that Greece risks bringing itself into ridicule and I urge the Government in Athens to soften its line.
I am known in this House and in my constituency as a strong philhellene and a friend of Greek and Cypriot MEPs alike, but I am also a member of the newly formed EP Friends of Macedonia.
Let us resolve this outstanding issue promptly and sensibly.
Also, I call on Parliament to send a delegation of MEPs to observe Macedonia's forthcoming presidential election and help legitimise the outcome.
As regards Croatia's imminent EU accession, it is regrettable that border disputes with Slovenia remain outstanding.
As in the case of Greece and Macedonia, these difficulties must be solved bilaterally rather than being dragged into the EU accession process.
Slovenia joined the European Union while it still had outstanding issues with Italy, which did not stand in its way and try and block its accession, so I see no reason why Croatia should be held back in turn.
In a similar vein and in future, I would never countenance Croatia vetoing Serbia's admission because of territorial disputes.
Of more immediate concern to my electors who are suffering from enlargement fatigue is the scale of organised crime and corruption in Croatia, which the Government must truly make it a national priority to eradicate.
<D>
(EL) Mr President, our children have independent personalities, they have an inviolable right to the protection of their fundamental rights, which means no degrading treatment and violence, no inhuman working conditions, no exclusion from education, no poverty, no sexual exploitation and abuse, no child soldiers at war.
And children have greater need of these universal values than adults do.
Firstly because they are, by definition, young and vulnerable.
Secondly, because the parent or teacher or priest and all those with whom they come into contact are always in a position of authority towards them; and thirdly, because if anything goes wrong during childhood, this ultimately has a decisive effect on a child's future life.
These are the rights which we are called upon to support today.
I shall focus on two:
Firstly, the children of immigrants are perhaps the most vulnerable.
Those who are born amongst us, at least, must immediately acquire the nationality of our country.
They should not be stigmatised from birth, and should of course go to school regardless of their parents' status, and should not be condemned to social exclusion.
Secondly, protection of children on the internet: children who often go online and surf unsuspectingly and talk to strangers, and children who may be victims of sexual exploitation - commodities in a very profitable business.
Mr President, the internet is the new village square.
Just as parents warn their children not to talk to strangers in the village square, so they should be educated and made aware that similar concern and advice are needed when it comes to the internet.
Europe should play its part in providing such education as well as helplines for parents and children faced with such situations.
<D>
Mr President, I think we have reached the end, and we should all be very pleased that we have arrived at this moment after such a long journey.
If the codecision procedure is ever justified, I think it is in the case of this package and the way it has been handled.
The key to this package lay in the need to bring the Commission, the Council and Parliament to an agreement.
Parliament did very well to take the lead - it can be seen to be justified now more than ever - and in pressing to have this package considered absolutely essential.
Right from the start, we would not accept any kind of split or separation, so as to achieve a whole that could guarantee safety at sea.
I think we can be confident that there are guarantees for the future that ad hoc political measures will be superfluous.
We will thus save ourselves from disgraceful situations in which certain people in power criticise the positions of some governments and have to praise the positions of others.
In future, therefore, the major decisions will be in the hands of independent committees, who will make rigorous, authoritative, immediate and capable use of decision-making tools.
That will ensure that the decisions made are rigorous, right and fair.
That is because we have had to balance many different things here in this package: classification societies have had to be brought together with marine equipment; all interests have had to be put clearly on the table; and, above all, Parliament has had to show leadership.
We should be pleased at the fact that Parliament has shown this leadership.
It can now proudly say loud and clear that the European Union has not waited for the IMO - the International Maritime Organisation - but that we have taken the lead.
It was our duty, and we did not need to wait for anyone.
I think we can feel pleased and have hope for the future, trusting that mistakes will not be repeated and that we have learnt the lessons of the past.
<D>
Mr President, coming from London I in no way minimise the terrorist threat.
Indeed, we Londoners have endured it for decades, including when it was Irish Republican terrorism part-funded from the United States.
The moral high ground is a precarious location.
Europol tells us that there were almost 500 terrorist attacks in the EU last year.
Of course it is a major criminal threat, but so are drug smuggling, people trafficking and corruption.
Where is the Council action to insist that all Member States sign and ratify the European Convention on Human Trafficking?
Where was the Council protest when the UK Government terminated a major corruption probe in January against 'national champion' arms manufacturer BAE?
Just because Liberals question the effectiveness of the liquids ban compared to its inconvenience, or challenge the mass collection of personal data, does not mean that we are soft on terrorism.
No area of policy should escape democratic accountability.
I was proud to be Vice-Chair of the European Parliament's Enquiry on Extraordinary Rendition and I share the outrage others have expressed on the complete silence of the Council in the face of our findings that many Member States were complicit in massive human rights abuses, of abduction and torture.
The Council would do well to look in its own backyard before it gobbles up the civil liberties of EU citizens.
MEPs have had no information on the implementation of the Framework Decision on Terrorism passed over five years ago.
Has every Member State fully transposed it?
How many cases have there been?
How many investigations or convictions have been recorded?
We know that agencies, even within one state, will not share information because of jealousies, power struggles and turf wars, let alone through cross-border cooperation.
Why not make that a priority instead of frenetically legislating to take away our privacy all the time?
There is also a lot of inconsistency when it comes to tackling radicalism.
This is an important subject, but it also implies the integration of the vast majority of moderate Muslims, and yet there are parts of the EU where great difficulties are placed in the way of the building of mosques.
Why not look at that?
Mr Szymański expressed an extreme right-wing view that we cannot pay too high a price for security.
I could not disagree with that more fundamentally.
Is it not what the Communists said to justify their repression?
Instead of trading too much liberty for security, let us look at what really works: targeted investigations and intelligence-led policing.
That is the way to keep public confidence and cooperation.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, I welcome the review of the transposition of the first railway package and the planned recast.
I believe that this review is long overdue.
However, I regret the fact that the Commission is receiving no, or only insufficient, information from the Member States.
That makes an efficient and honest assessment extremely difficult.
However, it is not only necessary to make an assessment.
We also need to urge the Member States to actually implement the necessary steps.
In any assessment, it is essential that importance be attached to the subject of safety.
Have we learned from the recent negative experiences and will these be taken into account?
That is my question.
On this issue, the Commission is far too reticent towards the public, who are extremely concerned.
This applies to quality, too.
I would like to ask the Commission to consider how generally binding quality criteria can be set.
A great deal has been said about inadequate quality, but it is not possible to measure this reliably.
The lack of investment, which you have already mentioned, Commissioner, is also regrettable.
Despite Cohesion Fund cofinancing, in most countries, investment in roads is still significantly higher than in the rail system.
I would like, in this context, to mention ERTMS - this system categorically must be introduced across Europe for the network, but also for the rolling stock, in order to improve route safety.
I would warn against further steps in the direction of the planned liberalisation of national passenger transport.
The initiatives already taken in this connection have shown that there are still many hurdles to be overcome and that the Commission would do well to first of all carry out a complete technical harmonisation and ensure the thorough transposition of the directives adopted.
<D>
(HU) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our policies for industrial development and the manufacturing sectors can help the European economy become a leader in competitiveness, knowledge and sustainability, in line with the Lisbon objectives.
Lisbon stands for growth in employment rates, significant increase in the employment of women, demand for the provision of proper conditions for the employment of female employees, and wide-ranging support for equal opportunities - over and above the positive role of women in the economy.
Equal opportunities must be underpinned in every area of industry: in employment, pay, promotion, the provision of vocational education and training, the availability and monitoring of different forms of flexible work, and the reconciliation of work and private life.
Overall, decent working conditions must be provided for women in industry and proper representation in the organisations whose job it is to safeguard their interests.
These areas do not constitute an exception from the requirements of ensuring gender equality and the principles and practice of gender mainstreaming must be applied consistently here too.
It is important that we have the right information about actual work relations in the many, essentially different sectors of industry and the differences between the sectors themselves.
A wide range of statistical information is required for shaping and drafting strategies and concrete proposals.
Innumerable international management research projects have shown that the special leadership qualities of women can make a big contribution to business success.
Europe must not lose this opportunity.
Thank you.
<D>
- (SV) Mr President, there is an issue that concerns a large number of European citizens today.
It is increased unemployment and the wider gaps that it entails.
They must have been extremely disappointed with the results of the most recent summit.
Absolutely no strategy for dealing with rising unemployment was established at that summit.
They say that they have already done what needs to be done.
They also say that the summit that should have taken place at the beginning of May will no longer be a summit.
It will now be a troika meeting.
This is a clear signal to citizens that the EU's leaders do not see employment and combating unemployment as a priority.
The European Parliament is not involved at all - one month before the European Parliament elections.
Mr Barroso has called for discussions today, but the Council's conclusions do not even mention the European Parliament.
I would like to say something briefly about automatic stabilisers.
GM, the United States and Sweden have been mentioned in the debate today.
It is true that we, in Sweden, have better social insurance systems, but the reimbursement rates have fallen from 80%.
Car workers who become unemployed will currently receive a pay-out of something in the region of between 50% and 60% of their pay.
Thus, it is not quite so wonderful any more.
Finally, I would like to say a few words about mobility.
Mobility is important within the EU and so is the fight against protectionism.
However, the Commission and the Council need to take responsibility and ensure that equal pay for equal work applies throughout the EU.
Then we can also work to promote increased mobility and to combat protectionism.
<D>
President of the Commission. - I was very reassured by yesterday's commitment by Prime Minister Papandreou to cut public deficits and reduce the Government's debt through permanent expenditure cuts and revenue increases.
We believe the current budget for 2010 that is now being discussed in the Greek Parliament and Prime Minister Papandreou's statements are steps in the right direction.
I have been following the situation very closely with this government and with the previous government, namely the question of public finances.
We were also very impressed by the candid presentation made by the Prime Minister of Greece in the last European Council.
He is fully aware of the problem and he has shown us his determination to address it.
Greece will submit to the Commission in the course of January an updated stability programme, as foreseen in the Stability and Growth Pact.
I trust that this programme will include concrete measures to strengthen fiscal adjustment in 2010 and to ensure lasting consolidation of public finances.
Naturally, the Commission will continue to monitor very closely the macroeconomic and fiscal situation and the implementation of the measures in Greece.
Having said this, I do not consider it appropriate at this stage to elaborate on possible scenarios.
We believe that Greece is now taking appropriate measures and that we should support Greece in the enforcement of those measures.
<D>
(ES) Madam President, I should like firstly to congratulate Mr Siekierski on what I consider to be an excellent report, which has garnered a lot of support within the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
As we all know, the Community's intervention stocks have been used to provide food aid to those most in need for more than 20 years.
The problem, Mr Stevenson, is that successive common agricultural policy reforms have been greatly reducing the stocks.
I would also like to point out here that if we suppress or attempt to suppress this programme we would send out a very bad signal at this very delicate moment in time, when many Europeans do not have enough to eat.
In this respect, it is clear that when the stocks run out, and as I have already said they are gradually becoming more depleted, we will have to turn to the open market.
I would like to highlight here something that I see as a very positive element in the report, that when we turn to the market, there should be an obligation that the products be EU produced, locally sourced, and fresh.
It would also seem appropriate to me that the scheme should remain 100% EU funded, since I feel that at times such as this the aid cannot and should not be dependent on each Member State's capabilities, if we do not wish to go into those capabilities in detail.
Likewise, it would seem to be a good idea to extend the programme duration to three years.
Finally, I would like to point out that the European Commission still has time to use the interventions wherever they may be necessary or possible, and that more than one farming sector would appreciate it.
I am thinking in particular of the dairy producers in my region, Galicia, for whom such an intervention would help to solve the difficult situation that they are facing, and would at the same time help to provide food for the most deprived.
<D>
(DE) Madam President, I would also like to say that Mr Peterle has produced an excellent report.
We should be clear about one thing: the freedom-loving people of central Asia are among our most important partners.
This region has often been dominated by foreign powers.
For the first time in a long time - for centuries - it is again free.
We should exploit this opportunity to establish a real partnership of the free.
I heard talk earlier of crime.
Of course, we must work together to combat crime, but first we should look at the culture in these countries and understand that these are ancient trading nations.
They do not just trade in drugs; they trade in goods which were always important for Europe and the world.
We should therefore say that this is about partnership, not paternalism.
<D>
in writing. - I support this Report which was initiated by the Socialist Group.
The report is about worker's information and consultation rights.
It calls on the Member States to better implement the 2002 framework directive, in particular, by:
introducing effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions
making sure that information is sent in due time so that workers' representatives can react before any decision by central management
extending workforce size thresholds regardless of age or type of employment contract to cover all workers
It also calls on the Commission to start infringement procedures against Member States that fail to implement this legislation and make sure that all information and consultation directives are coherent and where necessary propose a revision.
We must give a stronger voice to workers in the decision making process of their company.
This is even more important during the times of crisis, in order to mitigate or avoid job losses.
<D>
(PT) Madam President, difficult times require brave political decisions.
That is exactly why we do the jobs we do, and also why I would congratulate President Barroso on the ideas he has told us about here.
The European Parliament has also already taken clear positions in a number of reports on the issue of the euro and the need for stability, as well as on the problem of growth.
We cannot just look at one side of the argument.
Emerging from the crisis requires, for example, that the workings of the permanent fund take into account the specific situations of Member States that are currently paying increasing interest rates on their public debt.
This is a policy that must also be committed to competitiveness, to better credit, to a tax policy that can be positive for attracting investors; in essence, to anything related to wealth creation.
However, it is also for this reason that we need more European institutions.
The European Parliament's positions have been set out clearly and not via the media.
This is not the time for ideological decisions, but to think of the public.
What they demand of us is sensible and quick decisions.
<D>
(SK) First of all, allow me to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work on this report.
I think that thanks mainly to Mr Rübig this Parliament has managed to find a compromise that is acceptable to both the Commission and the Council and should result in adoption of this proposal at first reading.
I believe that the EUREKA initiative concerning a research and development programme for small and medium-sized enterprises is very much welcomed by the business community.
The fact that so many countries participate in this initiative confirms that prior to this programme there had been a lack of interest in solving the problems of small and medium-sized enterprises.
In spite of the European Parliament's efforts, the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Development has not solved the problem of how SMEs approach the funds provided to support their research, development and innovation activities either.
It is thus extremely encouraging to see that this bottom-up initiative has met with so much approval in all the relevant European institutions.
Although there is no doubt that some progress has been made, the fact is that some questions still remain unanswered.
I am thinking here of the eligibility criteria for the SMEs, in particular the proportion of time and annual turnover dedicated to research activities.
Personally, I am of the opinion that when setting these criteria we should be more broadminded and consider opening the Eurostars programme up to smaller enterprises with substantial innovation and development potential in spite of their size.
In conclusion I want to say how pleased I am that my country, Slovakia, is also involved in the cooperation: this should improve the situation of small and medium-sized innovative enterprises whose development has to some extent been lagging behind until now.
<D>
(EL) Madam President, I think that this evening's debate is very important because, with the consent of the European Parliament, with the resolution that I imagine we are going to unanimously support tomorrow, we shall again give momentum to the implementation of the decent work agenda which we all supported last year.
Convention 188 is nothing more than a part of the application of this agenda to the fisheries sector, which was not covered by the standard contract on seafaring work and, as previous speakers said, it is very important that we also have a minimum coverage at global level in this sector too.
The countries of the European Union will, I imagine, all ratify this Convention by 2012, as provided for.
Eight Member States have already ratified it, meaning that the Convention will start to apply and all of us living on the coast will therefore be able to take pride in the fact that our fishermen have coverage and will not have competition from third countries which may have social support for their fishermen.
I would reiterate that Parliament has already voted in favour of protection for women working in or connected with fisheries.
Female employment in fisheries, both direct and indirect, is very important, because if women in coastal areas did not stand by fishermen, these areas would be much poorer and much more sparsely inhabited, because needs are met by people, not just legislative texts.
We are therefore contributing to a culture of coastal areas, a social culture which will make use of the cultural elements of Europe linked to the sea and coastal areas.
From south to north, every area has its peculiarities; however, the Convention which we adopt for ratification by the Member States provides cover in every instance and for fishermen's every need.
In particular, we must support measures for their education and care in old age.

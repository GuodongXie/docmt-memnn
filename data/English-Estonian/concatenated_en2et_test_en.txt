Qimonda is a paradigm case in the current context of global financial and economic crisis.
It is a company that uses cutting-edge technology, employs highly qualified workers and promotes research.
Qimonda meets the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy.
The Portuguese Government has been doing everything to find a solution that makes this company viable, but the solution is also dependent on the involvement of the German Federal Government and the state governments of Bavaria and Saxony.
The Portuguese Government has already decided to make EUR 100 million available for this purpose.
As I said, it has been doing and will continue to do everything it can, as was, in fact, recognised by Qimonda's German workers during the recent official visit by the President of the Portuguese Republic.
The European Commission and the Member States have been taking steps - and rightly so - to save many banks and to support certain industries such as, for example, the automotive industry.
Why not also support Qimonda?
Leaving Qimonda to its fate will have extremely serious consequences.
Not only will thousands of workers in Germany and Portugal lose their jobs, but invaluable European intellectual property and a lot of Community funds that were invested in Qimonda will also be lost.
Keeping Qimonda going in Germany and in Portugal is of such strategic importance for Europe that European Union support is well justified.
Commissioner, we must be consistent and, if we are to be consistent, we will do everything to save Qimonda.
Qimonda is not just any company!
<D>
(PL) Mr President, in speaking of the European Neighbourhood Policy we must remember, first of all, to support those governments that respect basic freedoms and human rights, and to encourage those rights in countries where they are not respected.
This is of fundamental importance for the stability of the European continent.
The list of countries included in the ENP is a long one.
I would like to draw your attention to two countries, Ukraine and Belarus, which may be included in the ENP.
Ukraine must be a priority for us, and current negotiations with that country should lead to the conclusion of an association agreement and then make it possible for that country to become a member of the EU.
Such a policy should provide us with an insurance policy against Russia's developing ambitions and yet another attempt to make Ukraine a vassal state.
Finally, Belarus - the Commission's initiative to invite Belarus as an observer to the ENP conference would seem to be premature.
We should bear in mind that this country is still under the dictatorship of Lukashenko, breaching human rights and the rights of ethnic minorities.
The EU would do better to provide more effective support for the people and the opposition within Belarus.
A reduction in the cost of visas for Belarussians, and particularly for students, could be a positive signal in this direction, and the Commission should introduce this without delay.
<D>
on behalf of the PSE group. - (RO) The Research Fund for Coal and Steel was established after the expiration of the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community, the first treaty upon the foundation of the European Union.
Europe possesses important coal deposits, but we need to invest in new, cleaner processing solutions.
Steel is a product still used by many industrial sectors, but research is necessary in this sector as well in order to identify cleaner and more efficient solutions from the energy point of view.
The importance of this research is even greater since the two sectors entail a large number of jobs that must be kept and whose working conditions need to be improved.
This research should also result in better working conditions for the employees of the two sectors.
In Romania, approximately 34 million tons of coal are extracted every year and approximately 8 million tons of steel are produced.
In these two industrial sectors, the number of directly or indirectly employed people is several hundred thousand.
This is why I believe this document is extremely important.
<D>
- Mr President, I add my thanks to Mr Florenz for his report but I think, amidst all the congratulations to the rapporteur and to the committee for its work, we need to face some cold facts: the EU is still doing too little, too late.
I do not expect to be popular for saying so, but we need to be measuring the EU's progress not against what other countries are doing, but against what needs to be done.
Against that measure we are still failing.
We are failing in not bringing sufficient ambition to this debate.
The latest science tells us we need to be reducing emissions by around 9% year on year.
The targets set out in this report and in the EU's climate package are simply not ambitious enough.
We are failing in not bringing enough urgency to this debate.
If we are not well on the way to a zero-carbon economy in the next eight to ten years we will have lost the opportunity to have halted the worst of climate change.
We are failing in not being consistent.
Today, we speak of renewables and energy efficiency.
Yesterday, a majority in this House adopted the Laperrouze report which proudly upheld the role of coal in Europe.
We are failing in giving the impression that the climate change debate is all about giving things up, about doing without things.
We need to get much better at showing real political leadership and demonstrating that action on climate change will bring us a better quality of life.
It is not about shivering around a candle in a cave: it is about a future that can be more positive and attractive than today's.
So I commend to you the idea of adopting a green new deal for Europe, a way of addressing both the economic crisis and the climate crisis, with a major investment in energy efficiency and renewables, to create millions of new green jobs in Europe.
But that is not about kick-starting economic growth in a 'business as usual' direction.
It is about an urgently-needed transition not to a Europe based on the ever-increasing consumption of natural resources, but to a steady-state economy for Europe; not more aggregate quantitative growth, but real qualitative development.
That debate urgently needs to be begun, and the EU is very well placed to start it.
<D>
(ES) Mr President, Commissioners, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I wish to start off with the European Strategic Energy Technology Plan and congratulate Mr Buzek, and thank him for including amendments that my group felt were essential.
We are satisfied with the way in which we dealt with finance together, a common concern within such an important plan.
We must also make some mention of human resources, not only because they must be increased, but because the Plan also involves other aspects such as training, mobility and coordination.
One extremely important objective has been achieved in that a more significant role has been allocated to technologies that increase energy efficiency and to research in general, deploying the full potential of the European research area.
The report enhances research and basic sciences that are essential for progress to be made in energy technology, and calls for the private sector to invest more in research and assume greater risks to make the EU a frontrunner in this sector.
Improvements must also be made to technology transfer, a task to be undertaken by the new European Institute of Innovation and Technology, and there must be greater cooperation with the Member States and other Community instruments to bolster research, development and innovation capacities in those areas.
Coordination has to extend to all fields which, owing to their multidisciplinary nature, play a part in energy technology research and development, especially information and communication technologies.
In relation to gas, it simply ought to be said that LNG facilities and their storage infrastructures, provided they have interconnections with transport networks, operate as complementary facilities which play an essential role by guaranteeing access to new operators and speeding up the creation of a genuine internal European market.
It would thus seem logical to apply the same treatment in this area.
Within this context, operating on the basis of the 'one-stop shopping' principle upheld by this House, a combined operator of independent infrastructures emerges as the most effective option.
Using a single operator gives users access to gas infrastructures, since they will encounter similar contracts and codes, the same level of transparency and the chance to arrange services in groups.
This is the reasoning behind the three amendments we are tabling in plenary, and I ask my colleagues to vote for them.
<D>
Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating my friend and colleague, Mr El Khadraoui, who, it is fair to say, despite appearances suggesting the contrary, has actually proved himself capable of producing a very sound and workable report.
I am happy to add my support to it, and indeed to the underlying principle that the polluter should pay.
On this side of the House, we attach great importance to air quality, about which we are all very concerned, and we all know that lorries pollute.
As Mrs Lichtenberger put it, 'there is documented evidence'.
Now Mrs Wortmann-Kool, who has left, spoke about the obstacles to the internal market and Mr Jarzembowski, despite his report on the greening of transport, also expressed reservations about the Eurovignette.
I would say to both of them that the biggest threat to all markets will be if we get overtaken by pollution.
I do not believe that an extra 2-3% will be a huge burden, but it will show that we are taking serious steps to counter pollution.
Mr O'Neachtain expressed reservations and concerns about Ireland and other peripheral countries.
He seems not to understand that this is optional on Member States.
It will only apply in Ireland if his government actually decides it.
I think he, and probably Mr Bradbourn, will have learnt one lesson this afternoon, which is that it is dangerous - and makes you look rather foolish - to speak on a report that you either have not read or that you clearly do not understand.
On another point, as an aside, I believe that we should, and could, do much more to encourage freight off the roads onto the waterways, where one barge can carry as much as 15 lorries.
I therefore think that we should support the initiative of our erstwhile Belgian colleague.
<D>
in writing. - (RO) The purpose of revising this directive is to create a homogenous and coherent legislative framework, connected with the objectives of the Strategy on the prevention and recycling of waste so that Europe becomes a recycling society with an increased level of efficiency in using waste resources.
The following shall be established:
• A 5-step waste management hierarchy: prevention, reuse, recycling, energy recovery and waste disposal (including storage);
• Measures/plans for the prevention of waste generation;
• Mandatory recycling targets for municipal waste, as well as construction and demolition waste;
• Increased responsibility of the manufacturer to supply information to the public regarding the possibilities to reuse and recycle products.
The actions to be taken in the Member States in order to achieve all the above-mentioned objectives should encourage the modernization and creation of new units for waste recycling, conditioning for reuse, namely "the green industry”.
I voted for the revision of the Waste Framework Directive because all these measures shall contribute to the creation of new jobs, safer and more durable waste management, rational use of national resources and adjustment to climate change (development of non-ETS sectors).
<D>
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, President of the Council and President of the Commission, together with my Irish colleague, Kathy Sinnott, I have made a proposal for a new protocol to be amended to the Lisbon Treaty before its final approval.
It will outlaw a revolutionary decision by the European Court of Justice dated 18 December 2007.
A Latvian company wanted to build a school in Sweden with Latvian workers being paid much less than Swedish workers for similar jobs.
Swedish trade unions established a blockade.
This action has now been deemed illegal by the European Court of Justice.
They will only allow the Treaty principle on free movement of goods and services to be moderated by the other fundamental principle of the right to strike if there is a risk to public security, order or health.
A normal salary does not count.
Collective bargaining does not count.
The Scandinavian flexisecurity model, the voluntary cooperation between trade unions and employers, can be scrapped.
Foreign workers in foreign companies in Ireland may now work for the Irish minimum salary of EUR 9 an hour.
It is illegal for Irish trade unions to act against this Court judgment except in relation to the minimum wage.
It is even worse in my country, where we do not have a minimum wage.
This Court judgment is a disaster and must be annulled by a new wording in the Treaties or a legally binding protocol.
You can see our proposal on my website.
I urge the Slovenian Presidency and the President of the Commission to raise the question at the summit.
I have a question for the Commission and Council: When will we have a consolidated Treaty so that we can understand the content?
<D>
(FI) Mr President, the President-in-Office of the Council said that human rights issues should be taken into account in all policy.
That is true, and that is what should happen in foreign affairs, but the EU should also take a look in its own backyard.
Are foreign workers within the EU treated in a way that takes account of everyone's human rights?
There is much poverty here.
In fact, that does not come under the EU's official policy.
It is outsourced to the Church and charities.
The EU must take a more determined stand on human rights; only deeds mean anything, not words.
Finally, I would like to raise the issue of the humanitarian crisis in Iraq, which is about to reach catastrophic proportions.
Some 4.5 million people have had to leave their homes, and the Iraqis last year represented the largest group of asylum seekers in Europe.
The EU has responded to the crisis by allocating EUR 4 million to the work of the UN Refugee Agency and the Netherlands Red Cross, and a further EUR 11 million is planned for the country's health services and schools.
Is this sufficient support, however, from a rich European Union for these 4.5 million people who are, through no fault of their own, in such a plight?
The Iraq crisis is now one of the world's worst.
<D>
Mr President, to answer Mr Mitchell on this serious issue, the EU still has serious concerns over Iran's nuclear programme and the country's lack of interest in responding fully to the concerns raised by the possible military dimension of this programme.
In December 2007 the European Council declared that it would be unacceptable for Iran to have a nuclear military capability.
In this respect, the Council has on numerous occasions condemned the fact that Iran has not fulfilled its international obligations, which are laid down in Resolutions 1696, 1737, 1747 and 1803 of the United Nations Security Council, specifically the obligation to suspend all activity linked to uranium enrichment, which is crucial if we are to have the necessary framework to begin negotiations and move towards a long-term solution.
The EU has always supported Iran's right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy, and if Iran wants to rebuild the confidence of the international community in the peaceful nature of its nuclear programme, it must suspend sensitive activities involving the nuclear fuel cycle.
The proposals made by Mr Solana in June 2006, repeated in June 2008 on behalf of the six most closely involved countries, still apply and must be used to break the current deadlock.
The EU strongly regrets the fact that Iran suspended the provisional application of the Additional Protocol in February 2006.
As a result of this - as underlined by the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) - the IAEA knows less about certain aspects of the Iranian nuclear programme.
In addition, as we were recently reminded once again by the Director General of the IAEA in his report of 15 September, Iran is still refusing to answer specific questions that the IAEA has put to it about activities linked to the design and production of nuclear weapons.
As the IAEA Director General said - and I cannot draw a different conclusion - this situation is a source of grave concern for the EU and the international community.
<D>
I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution because I believe that the EU should continue to lead by example in the fight against climate change.
It is worth noting that the EU has surpassed the goals drawn up in Kyoto.
I believe that the Copenhagen agreement should be binding.
In this regard, I have tabled an amendment to Parliament's resolution on this matter, requesting an international set of sanctions to be included in the final text.
I believe that the agreement should be global, ambitious and with a clear timeline.
If we are not ambitious, we will end up with a token instrument that will be even less effective than the Kyoto Protocol, which already provides for international sanctions.
Let us therefore hope that there will be effective regulation and that the agreement will include a review clause so that it can be easily updated.
I also believe that China and India cannot be exempted from all responsibility when they produce a large percentage of global emissions, while our industries are going to great lengths to reduce their emissions.
The US has a great responsibility for ensuring the success of this summit.
I hope that the President of the United States, Barack Obama, will show that he deserved the Nobel Peace Prize, because combating climate change will contribute to peace and happiness for all nations.
<D>
(SV) We know that more and more people are hiding within the EU's borders.
We know that, in the near future, the EU will need rising numbers of immigrant workers.
We also know that thousands of people every week are trying to find a better life in Europe.
Many of them die on their way to our continent.
We know that many people without documents are exploited and live in miserable conditions.
This is not worthy of the European Union.
The universal values that the EU wants to spread throughout the world include the right of every person to a dignified life.
There is a shameful paradox here.
The fact that the EU is to have a common asylum and migration policy is reasonable, but it must not mean that those countries that want to take a harder line and hunt down people in various ways should be the ones making the decisions.
This will reduce the chances of finding a decent life in Europe.
At the same time, it is important that the devious employers who exploit people in a vulnerable position know that punishment and sanctions can be meted out anywhere in the EU.
I admit that the report is a difficult balancing act and I can sympathise with Mr Catania's reasoning with regard to his reservation.
However, the compromise is a step in the right direction, even if I have certain opinions on, for example, the extent of the employer's reporting obligations.
I would like to say to Mrs Segelström that we do not have a conservative government in Sweden.
We have a four-party government with strong liberal elements.
<D>
(PT) Mr President, the European Parliament is represented before the Court by its President and, in controversial cases, the President first consults the plenary.
This is what happens with proceedings.
The new report extends this system to other procedural acts where the President represents Parliament and, in controversial situations, consults the plenary.
Yet there is something new in the report in the way it brings in the Conference of Presidents as an intermediary decision-making body between the President and the plenary.
This solution is not problematic in itself, yet it would be good to take this opportunity to stress that the European Parliament must never lose sight of the traditional parliamentary principle of concentrating all final decision-making power in the plenary.
The plenary is sovereign in all things, as it embodies the legitimacy arising from the ethics of representation.
It is true that institutions that govern complex and broad areas, as the European Parliament does, often cannot avoid the temptation to surround their own democratic power with red tape.
This temptation is often impossible to avoid, yet the fact remains that we have to steer clear of wrapping democracy in too much red tape, as the efficacy of good governance must never mean losing the space for politics, still less abdicating space for politics to quasi-administrative forms such as committees and, sometimes, conferences.
This is because, to borrow Mirabeau's expression, these are not a real 'cross-section of the population'.
<D>
(PL) Mr President, Prime Minister, Madam President, just as it did seven years ago, the Portuguese Presidency faces some major tasks and major challenges.
I am convinced that the European Treaty will be adopted in a good atmosphere and with consent, providing a basis for effective and efficient management of the EU.
This is the most important matter today; because only then can Europe gradually become a political power and have a positive impact on the fate of the world.
But economic power in the EU is always something essential, and today this is even more true than it was seven years ago.
We are faced with the challenges of globalisation and we wish to become, and I quote 'the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth, with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion'.
But today we know how difficult that is.
So a social Europe increasing employment and also battling against climate change, which it was not seven years ago, must be a Europe of a completely free market.
An open market, a market free of protectionism and monopolies.
We owe this to our citizens, if we wish to act on the principles of the Lisbon Strategy in the sphere of competition, innovation and progress.
Let us also remember that management of the Strategy's guidelines from a free-market position has worked much better than management from Member State level.
And lastly, a third matter - our success depends to a large extent on relations with our neighbours.
I congratulate the Portuguese Presidency on the far-reaching rapprochement on the EU's southern borders, but we should not for a minute forget the eastern dimension, especially as the results of fair and free elections in Ukraine have presented us with the chance of a democratic, free-market and pro-European stabilisation of the eastern border of the European Union.
Elections were held just two and a half weeks ago, and it is worth proclaiming this in the European Parliament.
<D>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this directive is a disgrace and an insult to Europe's legal culture.
It is totally unacceptable and liable to cancel out the culture of welcome we have had for thousands of years, and the deep roots of a European identity that has been forged through the practice of hospitality.
The directive is yet another monument to Fortress Europe, the materialisation of a reactionary utopia seeking to obstruct the freedom of movement of men and women.
The right to mobility cannot be checked by shutting men and women up behind barbed wire or inside a foul detention centre.
Mr Mate, we are talking about 18 months - the maximum detention period - not 6 months, as you said.
That is 18 months without having committed any crime!
I would like to refer to the words of Archbishop Agostino Marchetto of the Council of Migrants of the Italian Episcopal Conference, when he said that a person cannot be detained for a mere administrative infringement and also that persons cannot be kept in inhuman and degrading detention centres such as those visited by this Parliament's Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs.
Furthermore, this directive is an inhumane directive because it makes provision for return to a country of transit.
Libya is likely to become a mass deportation destination for migrants.
It makes provision for the detention and expulsion of unaccompanied minors, it lays down a re-entry ban, thus systematically infringing the right to asylum, and provides for discretionary legal aid.
That is the true nature of this directive.
What is more, the directive is being imposed by governments.
In this Chamber we have been party to the dictatorship of the Council, which has said to Parliament: 'like it or lump it', even issuing threats against the idea of any sort of continuation of the debate on immigration.
The European Parliament is passively submitting to this decision.
I appeal to the dignity of European Parliament.
This is not co-decision.
What we are looking at is giving assent to the Council.
The truth is that governments want to activate immediately the EUR 700 million allocated by the Return Fund.
That is the true nature of the directive.
What we ought to do, though, is to listen to society, to those outside this Parliament, the heads of state of third countries, Amnesty International, the churches, the European Episcopal Conferences, the trade unions and the Council of Europe: all of them are telling us not to adopt this directive.
Even the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which according to the Treaty of Amsterdam should be consulted on all matters relating to asylum and immigration dealt with by the European Commission, is telling us not to adopt this directive.
Repressive policies like these are the real cause of the European Union's greatest tragedy: deaths at sea.
Yesterday 150 died, and over the last ten years there have been 12 000 such deaths.
The European Union is staining itself with an unacceptable crime and this directive makes it further complicit in these killings that have turned the Mediterranean into a graveyard.
It would probably be a good idea, as a tribute to these martyrs, not to adopt this directive.
<D>
on behalf of the UEN Group. - Madam President, first of all I want to pay tribute to the Council and congratulate them for their efforts, particularly with regard to Russia and the situation in Georgia.
It took a lot of strength and courage and great diplomacy to find a peaceful solution to the difficulties which we faced.
It proved - if anybody needed further proof - that collectively and with strong leadership we can achieve an awful lot more than mere military might or economic wealth can bring to us, simply by the example that we give and the tactics that we employ.
Secondly I think it is important to make sure that bringing the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership to life is on the agenda for the upcoming Council.
Never at any stage in our history is it more required that we bring together our partners at the Mediterranean level to guarantee that we can bring about not just economic development but also the peaceful coexistence of nations.
In particular we should follow the example of the Egyptian Government in their ongoing peace negotiations with regard to Sudan, Chad and other areas.
I have two further points.
It would be wrong of me not to mention the situation with regard to Ireland and the Lisbon Treaty.
Member States have already given Ireland a period for reflection - for which we are thankful - but this is no different to the period of reflection which both France and the Netherlands got when they rejected the Constitutional Treaty.
It takes time to put forward proposals and ideas as to how these difficulties can be resolved.
It behoves us in Parliament to ensure that we do not try to put the gun to any country's head regarding whether or not it will ratify the Treaty - in particular because it requires a democratic vote of the people to guarantee the ratification of that Treaty.
Secondly, regarding the present financial crisis, I do not blame or point a finger at any particular person.
I congratulate the Council for getting their act together and taking decisive action.
I once again congratulate the Commission for actually standing up and saying what needed to be said before the Council acted and for ensuring that credibility was put into the market by saying that we are capable, able and willing to take action, either through the ECB, Ecofin, individual Member States or whatever else.
But let us not make the mistake of saying that everything that went on in the last two weeks is wrong and that everything that comes in the future is going to be right.
Our history must teach us that, over the period of time that we have been living in this world, there have been alterations and changes.
Those alterations and changes bring horrors of hardship on people.
We must first of all guarantee to protect the ordinary person.
The banks have got a bail-out.
The banks have got a guarantee.
With that guarantee also comes the responsibility for banks to now start lending to businesses and to people, to allow the economies to pick up again.
It is not only about cutting the wages or salaries of executives; it is about ensuring that the economic cycle can get back to where it is supposed to be.
The deposit guarantee is only a small aspect of this.
<D>
(CS) Mr President, Commissioners, I would first of all like to thank all the rapporteurs involved in our debate for their efforts.
Two reports dealing with the market in natural gas are in favour of liberalising this market in Europe.
The legislation offers an alternative to full ownership unbundling, using the ISO model.
The positive features include, in particular, the duties of national authorities to include renewables in transmission networks, guidelines for third-party access, setting up tariffs for access to networks and imposing sanctions for discriminatory behaviour.
The creation of the European network of transmission system operators for gas, i.e. the body active in the area of cooperation, and of the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators is also valuable.
These institutions are a precondition for creating a natural gas integrated market.
However, we should add that the advantages of market liberalisation can only bear fruit where a diversified supplier market already exists today, and that means most of the countries of Western European.
In contrast, natural gas suppliers in most of the new Member States have almost a monopoly.
Paradoxically, these countries may in the end suffer as a result of the liberalisation package because the proposed legislation will weaken the position of transmission operators who have contracts with producers with monopolies.
The so-called third way is better suited to this economic relations model.
I support market liberalisation, but when it comes to natural gas, in most of the new Member States we must first do away with the market monopolies and introduce more suppliers; only then can we proceed (for example) with ownership unbundling without any risks.
To conclude, let me say a few words about the European Strategic Energy Technology Plan.
It is closely linked to energy consumption in the Union, to reducing CO2 emissions, to Europe's energy dependency.
However, as the rapporteur points out, little attention is paid to economical production, co-generation or poly-generation, savings by end users and industrial energy efficiency, and the budget for the established goals is very small.
Funds are also lacking when it comes to technology demonstration, for example carbon capture and storage.
It would be nice if the sweeping European gestures and statements about energy research were accompanied by the corresponding budgetary sources.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - (DE) Mr President, honourable Members, I would like to start by thanking Mr Onyszkiewicz most warmly for this valuable report.
We have consistently emphasised that we value Parliament's opinion, and I am of course happy to provide you with further information on the course of the negotiations.
Mr President, Russia is and will remain an important partner for us.
Our shared interests are complex and overlapping, from economic contacts to, for example, our shared work as partners in the Middle East Quartet or, like yesterday, in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
Of course, as we are all aware, we also have major differences of opinion, regarding the territorial integrity of Georgia, for example.
Time and again tensions have arisen over the strengthening of our role in the neighbourhood we share with Russia.
In this context, it is often wrongly asserted that we are dependent on our large neighbour.
When it comes to trade and energy, we are, rather, mutually dependent or, to put it another way, we have each become an indispensible partner for the other.
These, then, are times in which our relations with Russia are hugely important, and in which a unified, visionary EU strategy is absolutely vital.
Tomorrow, President Obama will meet President Medvedev for the first time, in order to press the reset button, so to speak, for the USA's relationship with Russia.
This new approach is certainly to be welcomed, but we must not start again from scratch.
We do not need to reset our relations; instead we should constantly fine tune them.
This is right at the top of our list of priorities.
As the Commission noted in its communication of 5 November, the complex and extensive nature of our relations and the many areas in which we are mutually dependent mean that we need to engage consistently with Russia, and I would also say that we need to be sober and results-orientated.
The negotiations over a new agreement are without doubt the best way of putting forward a unified EU position that defends our interests, with the aim of reaching an agreement on the most important areas.
As I am talking to you right now, the fourth round of negotiations is underway in Moscow.
We have now agreed on a general structure for the agreement that should form a legally binding basis for all aspects of our relations in the foreseeable future.
At the same time, however, we have not set any artificial deadlines for the negotiations: in my opinion, we should take as much time as is needed to achieve a satisfactory result, because the current agreement will remain in force until that point, and there is therefore no desperate need to proceed with great urgency.
We do not therefore need to wait for the new agreement before we can deal with current issues.
So far, issues of politics, justice and security have been discussed, such that there is now a better understanding of our respective positions; we have now started to discuss economic issues.
It should, in any event, come as no surprise to us that the two sides have very different approaches in some areas.
While Russia has big ambitions for cooperation on foreign and security policy, for example, it is currently less ambitious when it comes to economic matters.
Naturally, it is in our interest, in the EU, for our trade and economic relations to include legally binding, enforceable provisions, in order to make sure that Russia accepts a system based on clear rules.
This applies in particular to the topic of energy, where we are striving for acceptance of the principles of the Energy Charter, the main ones being transparency, mutuality and non-discrimination.
The gas crisis at the beginning of the year has dented confidence in the reliability of our energy relations, and this must be rectified.
We are therefore trying, in parallel to the negotiations, to significantly strengthen the early warning system, which lays down provisions on monitoring and observation in the event of crisis, in order to avoid conflict and facilitate resolution.
The agreement that we are negotiating should, of course, also be based on respect for human rights and democracy, and we believe this should be an essential component.
When it comes down to it, Russia and the EU have, as Mr Vondra said, entered into the same commitments in the UN, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Council of Europe.
Our treaty should emphasise respect for these shared commitments and interests.
Obviously, it cannot resolve the conflicts in Europe all on its own, but it should provide a framework for conflict resolution.
In parallel to our negotiations, we will continue our efforts in existing forums, in the Geneva talks for Georgia, in the 5+2 format for Transnistria and in the Minsk process for Nagorno-Karabakh.
Justice and internal affairs are, as I said, of relevance to both parties in the negotiations, and they are areas where I see significant potential for mutually beneficial cooperation, particularly in the fight against organised crime and also in improving conditions for bona fide travellers.
However, the possibility of abolishing the visa requirement, as Russia has called for, will only be a realistic prospect in conjunction with further improvements in other areas.
For example, it would make it easier for us to cooperate effectively in general terms if Russia implemented higher data protection standards; research, education and culture also provide numerous opportunities for cooperation in the interests of our citizens, and should be taken into consideration in the new agreement.
The report we are debating today obviously includes many other proposals on which I have no time to comment right now, but they will of course come up in the debate.
I would like to emphasise once again that I especially welcome the line that Mr Onyszkiewicz has taken in the report before us and in the proposed draft resolution.
If further information is required following today's debate, I will of course be delighted to give the Committee on Foreign Affairs, for example, a full briefing at any time, as I did last year.
To conclude, I would like to stress that it is an important concern to me that the negotiations should progress successfully, and they have my full support.
A good treaty will, I hope, place EU-Russia relations on a solid and predictable footing for the foreseeable future, and thus make an important contribution to the stability and security of our continent.
<D>
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, flexicurity is neither a panacea nor a taboo subject.
We just have to agree on the rules of the game.
It goes without saying that Europe must be equal to the challenges of globalisation and competition - not always fair competition - forced upon us by the world economy.
All of this requires flexibility, but that does not mean turning our backs on the European social model, its values, its standards of security and above all its solidarity.
Flexibility is therefore acceptable on condition that there are firm rules, guarantees and compensatory mechanisms in place.
Most importantly, Europe must lead the Member States in a strategy comprising certain key ingredients: a decent level of continuing training, adequate welfare measures, quality services beginning with childcare services, and social security systems to support workers during periods of inactivity.
Such support, incidentally, need not necessarily take the form of handouts; it could also be the provision of opportunities to acquire the skills required for new jobs on offer.
Finally, there must be measures for reconciling work and family life, to enable women in particular to enjoy truly equal opportunities in the world of work.
Naturally, these objectives necessitate a substantial amount of funding, but only in this way can flexicurity be an opportunity rather than a shortcut towards deregulation of the world of work.

Mr President, I represent Northern Ireland in this House, a region which, as everyone will know, has suffered decades of vicious terrorism.
And from that experience, I have two points to make in this debate.
Firstly, terrorism should never be appeased; it has to be defeated.
Start treating with terrorism, giving its prisoners special status and, ultimately, early release, and soon you will end up like Northern Ireland has ended up: with unrepentant terrorists at the heart of our Government.
Appeasement only whets the appetite - the insatiable appetite - of terrorists.
The second point I want to make is this: whereas state abuse is wrong, the naive belief, such as I find in this report, that lavishing so-called 'human rights' on terrorists will neutralise them will, in fact, only strengthen their cause as they expertly exploit and misuse every such right to their own advantage, while they go on denying their victims the most basic right of them all: the right to life.
Because of the excesses of their murderous strategy, sometimes the defence of society requires a choice between the uninhibited rights of terrorists and the rights of the innocent.
In such circumstances, I have no difficulty in choosing the right of society to defend itself over the supposed human rights of the terrorist.
The battle against terrorism is a battle of good against evil, and, if needs be, the right of the terrorist is secondary to that of society.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, firstly may I thank in particular the rapporteurs, Mr Karas and Mr Hoppenstedt, and others for their dedication in finding compromises in these two particular areas.
As regards the Hoppenstedt report, the positive outcome of Coreper this morning paves the way for an adoption at first reading.
An agreement on this strategic initiative is very welcome because it sends the right signal: a signal of our determination to respond to the financial crisis, to strengthen financial supervision and to improve the standard assessing process for financial reporting and auditing.
But this is only a first step in a very long process.
In the months to come, I look forward to continuing this work with you in the new Parliament.
On securitisation, we all agree that the 5% retention requirement is a first step.
The Basel Committee will work on quantitative retention.
This has been required by the G20.
The European Union is ahead of the curve, and we will contribute to bringing about further consistency at global level.
Let me just make a point concerning securitisation.
Mrs Bowles made a pretty strong contribution in this regard.
She is very much for securitisation and pointed out the good aspects of it and the amount of money that is contributed to the capital markets for small and medium-sized enterprises and to lenders at large in all Member States of the European Union.
In case there is any impression that I do not see the benefits of securitisation over the years, may I say that I certainly do!
In my previous capacity, and long before I came here, I was aware of the benefits of securitisations.
However, the issue is what proportion the originating securitiser should hold in that particular matter.
I accept what Mrs Bowles said: that in future a holding of whatever percentage will attract a capital charge.
One cannot be certain as to when the current financial crisis will end.
But, irrespective of when that end is going to be, I think we can be absolutely certain in years to come that financial institutions will be required, at all levels, to hold more significant and more quality capital against their lending.
I will not be here - but many of you will - but, whatever the end is, that will be the inevitable outcome of this particular financial crisis - not immediately, not maybe in the medium term, but in the longer term that will be a certainty.
If I looked into my crystal ball, that is what I would see in years to come.
So it is the percentage which is being debated.
People know my views on this.
I have held very strong views on this for a long period of time.
Various amendments have been put forward during the Council of Ministers stage and with the European Parliament about different 'outs' on one thing and another, which my officials, at my request, are very, very strongly against, because I strongly believe in the very simple proposition that 5% of something is better than 55% of zero.
The more outs that there are - we can have 5%, 10%, 15% - 15% of zero is still zero.
That is why I welcome the opportunity that the Commission in its report by the end of this year will come back to this particular matter in order to ensure that the wording is fairly tightened up.
I am strongly of that view because I do not wish to see particular outs.
But I readily appreciate what Mrs Bowles and others have said regarding the merits of securitisations for the capital market.
I hope I have never given the impression that I did not.
Finally, may I, too, join with the President in wishing those Members who are retiring well in their future careers, whatever they might be.
I have known most of them in some capacity or other in my five years here and I appreciate their contributions, even though I have not always agreed with them.
I suppose I should not single out any one person, but I would like to make special mention of Mr Purvis in this regard.
I always found his advice to be wise, measured, considered and not dogmatic, and I wish him, in particular, a very successful future.
<D>
(HU) The bogeyman of the Polish plumber has now been replaced by the menacing shadow of the Latvian construction worker.
The re-emerging unseemly debate has caused a great deal of harm to the entire EU.
Some people are sounding the alarm bell about social dumping, an unlimited invasion by workers of new Member States.
This is factually untrue.
Let us be realistic.
Let us not threaten voters with such talk.
The twelve new Member States have almost no comparative edge.
One of these advantages, relatively cheaper labour, will only last only a few years.
Fortunately, salaries are rising in our countries too.
I appeal to you that when you talk about equal treatment - this is another aspect of this matter -, let there be equal treatment for new and old members alike.
If we limit the potential inherent in the competition within the internal market, if we restrict freedom of enterprise, this will damage the entire EU.
The social aspect, however, is extremely important for me too.
Thank you.
<D>
in writing. - (PL) Mr President, I am voting in favour of accepting Mr Martin's report on the trade and economic relations with Korea.
The rapporteur has drafted a very good report, in which he points out the importance of Korea as a trading partner for the European Union in economic terms.
Conclusion of a Free Trade Agreement with Korea is part of the strategy to provide Europe with a global dimension.
A Free Trade Agreement between Korea and the European Union could constitute a basis for the promotion of high social and environmental standards and could serve as an example for other agreements that are currently at the negotiation stage.
I agree that every effort must be made to ensure that the European Union and Korea - under the aegis of the trade agreement currently being negotiated or through a separate agreement - themselves take on human rights obligations.
(The sitting was suspended at 12.50 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
<D>
(HU) Mr President, the European Union does not have a minority policy for Roma, nor for traditional national minorities, nor for migrant minorities.
I include the Roma among traditional national minorities, but at the same time, because of their specific socially disadvantaged situation, they must still be treated as a separate category.
I am delighted that, as the living conscience of the European Parliament, the two Hungarian Members of Roma descent, Mrs Járóka and Mrs Mohácsi, amongst others, have raised this question, because we rightly condemned the events in Italy in November.
It is right that we should continuously return to this question.
What is the duty of the European Union?
I am delighted with what Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner has said.
The European Union also has a duty, but it must make a distinction between what is the competence of a Member State and what is the competence of the European Union.
I also agree fully with Mr Swoboda, who is no longer here, not because of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, but because he is right, namely in that it is decided at local level whether or not something will succeed.
Specifically, the Member State must be given a national action programme.
I am proud that we prepared Europe's first medium-term Roma programme under my government department.
Money must be given to the Member State, but everything be decided at local level.
What can the EU do?
It should monitor what the Member States are doing and it should provide a 'best practice' method for the best solution.
It is not only a matter of money, but also of whether there are any qualified experts from the majority and Roma society who want to take this matter further.
The future of Europe depends on minorities.
<D>
President-in-Office. - (SL) Thank you very much, Mr President, for allowing me to speak at this moment.
I would also like to thank the Members of Parliament for their opinions, suggestions and initiatives put forward in this debate.
As Mrs Napoletano and others mentioned, the Foreign Ministers will be meeting informally at the end of this week.
That will be an opportunity to exchange opinions on Tibet, which was the topic of today's debate in this House, and your opinions, suggestions and initiatives will be very useful.
The opinions and positions of Members of Parliament will be taken into account as far as possible.
I should stress that the Council will strive to speak with one voice.
The Presidency will endeavour to make the Council's statement clear.
The Council will be clear in its stance on the respect of human rights, the rejection of violence wherever it comes from, and support for the freedom of expression, including the right to peaceful demonstration.
As I said in my introduction, we will work in favour of dialogue between the Chinese authorities and the Dalai Lama or his representatives.
We will continue to maintain contacts with our Chinese counterparts regarding permission for international journalists to visit Tibet.
I have already mentioned the statements of the Ministers for Sport regarding the Olympic Games.
They said nothing about the opening ceremony.
Perhaps other Ministers will address that issue in due course.
I would like to reiterate that the Olympic Games in China should be viewed as an opportunity to promote human rights.
<D>
Commission. - (ES) Mr President, with regard to the impact on the real economy of the turbulence, or the crisis, if that is what you wish to call it, in the financial markets in recent weeks, I repeat that according to our initial estimates - we will be publishing forecasts on Tuesday - but also according to opinions that are being made public by other bodies and public and private institutions, the impact of this turbulence on economic activity, economic growth and employment in European economies in 2007 will be felt, but it will be very slight.
A large proportion of the results for 2007 are already guaranteed by the results produced in the first two quarters, by the information available on what is happening in our economies in this third quarter and by the positive inertia of economic recovery based on the good, solid foundations that we inherited from 2006.
The risks will be more evident looking towards 2008.
In our forecasts in May the growth rates for 2008 were already affected by a maturing of the economic cycle and by the impact of the decisions adopted on monetary policy by the central banks.
In Europe and beyond, this financial crisis, this financial turbulence and the subsequent tightening of credit conditions are going to increase or are increasing the risks of a decline in results for 2008, but I still think that it is too early to make a definitive analysis from which to draw some final conclusions on the subject.
We need to hope that, insofar as many of the factors that have been encouraging the turbulence of recent weeks are related to confidence, if we recover confidence and if we all contribute to a rigorous vision and diagnosis of the situation in order to improve confidence, or to consolidate confidence, the 2008 results will be better or less concerning than some imagine they will be.
I think that most of those who have spoken broadly agree on what led to this increase in volatility and to the turbulence in the financial markets, and I also think that there is agreement that solutions need to be found.
However, the solutions are not simple, and we should not overact.
Just like good actors in the theatre, good politicians should not overact at times of turbulence.
We need to do more detailed analysis and understand the facts more fully, and we need to try to seek effective solutions to challenges that exist, those that are evident, and those that we have not yet discovered.
If we look back over the debates in Parliament or the reports on financial stability by the Monetary Fund or the Central Bank, the analyses by the European Commission and our own speeches in the recent past, we did not know where or when, but we did know that turbulence of this kind could occur, given the evolution of the financial markets, and the sophistication of the instruments and techniques used by financial institutions.
I repeat what I said at the start: the European economy is still on solid foundations.
The euro is protecting us.
Once again it has proven its ability to protect and to absorb shocks that under other circumstances, before the launch of the euro, would have created much greater difficulties for us, both from a monetary and financial point of view and in our real economy, and, to finish, I think that the European Central Bank, in exercising its responsibility, acted sensibly and correctly in August.
<D>
- (SK) Commissioner, I too would like to thank you for your active and immediate response to the case in question.
Because of globalisation and large movements of tourists, travellers and ordinary people today there is no place on earth where this disease could not appear.
We can already see this from the cases that have appeared in locations as far away from Mexico as New Zealand, Australia, Europe and Africa.
Despite the subsidiarity of healthcare, infectious diseases know no boundaries and oblige us to take joint action.
There can be no solution within the framework of a single country.
It is time for solidarity.
Slovakia is sufficiently prepared even for an expansion of the influenza infection into a larger epidemic, perhaps because of the earlier avian influenza.
We have 700 000 Tamiflu doses in national reserves for 5 million inhabitants and I must say that it is also perhaps on account of the earlier threat of avian influenza that the populace is definitely well-prepared.
In case of an epidemic it is very important to keep the public informed, because where there is no information there will be plenty of disinformation.
We can see this from a number of African countries, for example Egypt where the current threat of an influenza epidemic coupled with the idea that the disease was spread by pigs has led to 300 000 - 400 000 pigs being slaughtered.
However, we should perhaps show solidarity in this case in other ways, since travel agencies were selling holidays in these destinations but now people are travelling there only in case of need.
As we have Eurolat, we should also think about supporting Mexico, where it is believed that this infection will cause GDP to decline by up to 4 - 5% from current levels.
<D>
(PL) Madam President, people are afraid that measures such as the telecoms package are a restriction of their freedom.
I have received hundreds of letters on this matter, and not only from Poland.
I will quote from one of them: 'The European Parliament proposes to introduce changes to the law which will affect my access to the Internet, and which may restrict or create conditions for the use of certain Internet pages and sites.
The legislative changes proposed by the European Parliament will allow my Internet provider to offer me restricted or conditional services.
I am afraid that such changes will kill off the Internet and may have undesirable consequences for the economy in the European Union.'
This is the voice of Europe, the voice of the electorate.
I support them.
I advise people to be careful when voting, especially when it comes to candidates from Poland, where neither the Civic Platform nor the Law and Justice parties know what all this is about.
And to Mr Harbour, it seems that some clowns from Civic Platform and Law and Justice circles care more for seals and monkeys than for people.
<D>
This fisheries protocol ensures fishing opportunities off São Tomé and Príncipe for various fleets from Member States until 12 May 2014.
Under this agreement, Portugal has three licences for surface long-liners, with a lower number of vessels than provided for in the previous agreement.
Given the current crisis in the sector, we believe that it is important that the fees payable by owners should not be changed in relation to the previous agreement, but should remain at EUR 35, despite the fact that there has been a significant increase in catches per tonne: 25 tonnes for tuna seiners and 10 tonnes for long-liners.
However, according to an evaluation carried out while the previous agreement was in force, average annual catches in tonnes were lower than the reference tonnage.
According to this evaluation, and in line with the trends of recent years, there has been a reduction in the reference tonnage.
It was also found that there was a lower take-up of fishing opportunities by long-liners, which led to a reduction in this segment in the current report.
As with other cases, there remain concerns about the effectiveness of the development cooperation objectives...

(NL) Mr President, Commissioner, it is only by talking to each other that we avoid misunderstandings.
Intense discussions with one other are now going to take place because we are opening up the dialogue with the Russian Federation when we start talks on the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement.
It is good that the negotiations are now going to begin.
An incredible amount has changed in the last 10 years, both in Russia and in the European Union, but we are also more dependent than ever on one other.
That is why good binding agreements on energy, but also on climate change, are necessary for both parties.
Mr President, when it comes to these agreements we must also not forget a number of fundamentals.
Although some Members may have doubts, now of all times we must work hard for Community values, such as strengthening the rule of law, fighting corruption and stressing the importance of independent social debate in Russia itself.
Mr President, the negotiations will not be easy.
A new agreement need not be encyclopaedic, as far as I am concerned, but it must make a number of absolutely essential elements binding on both parties.
Mr President, we cannot wait until the agreement is on the table, because we need to hear positive noises from the Kremlin now on a number of other issues; I am very worried about certain developments: Chechnya, the TNK versus BP case and Abkhazia.
I would like to hear from the President what he means exactly by joint action.
<D>
I voted against this resolution.
It divides rather than unites men and women.
There is nothing innocent about the wording of paragraph 36: 'women must have control over their sexual and reproductive rights, notably through easy access to contraception and abortion'.
The rapporteur also insists on women having access free of charge to consultation on abortion.
However, abortion comes solely within the competence of the Member States.
As this resolution has no binding legal force, it cannot be used to exert pressure to liberalise abortion.
Then Parliament calls for sexist stereotyping, especially work carried out by men and women within the family, to be combated.
The resolution emphasises the importance of pre-school child care provision, child-minding services and the provision of assistance to elderly persons and other dependents.
Thus, Parliament is aiming to destroy the natural family as a place of socialisation and solidarity between generations.
This resolution does not offer any added value to women or to men or to the Union.
It is a pity, because respect for people who are different and the promotion of equal opportunities for men and women are a real social challenge.
<D>
The purpose of the common agricultural policy is not only to increase agricultural productivity and ensure rational development of farming production through optimal use of production factors, especially the workforce, but also to provide rural populations with a suitable standard of living, guarantee security of supplies and ensure reasonable prices for supplies to consumers.
Access to sufficient supplies of safe and nutritious food is currently a key political priority at EU and world level.
It is disturbing that food prices are higher than in previous years, and world food stocks have fallen to a critically low level.
There is a danger that the world financial crisis may induce developed countries not to honour their obligations in the area of aid to developing countries.
Medium- and long-term action is needed to safeguard world food production and to support those people who are most seriously affected in terms of basic nutritional needs.
The greatest challenge now is to develop a policy for agriculture and food which will meet the needs of the increasingly numerous world population, which, according to estimates, by the year 2050 will have grown by 40%, while world food demand is expected to double in the same period.
Development of a policy which will ensure farmers a decent income from the food they produce is a key political issue.
This is of fundamental importance in terms of safeguarding food production.
If the market is not able to ensure this, it should be done through appropriate policy.
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my Group, I would like to make just three comments on points of principle.
The first concerns impact assessment for legislative proposals.
I recognise that significant progress has been made since 1999, when Parliament took the initiative on this issue, and since 2003, when an interinstitutional agreement was adopted, which was negotiated by our Chairman, Mr Gargani.
However, there are still deficits.
Parliament is demanding - as it has done before in numerous resolutions - that impact assessments of legislative proposals be conducted on a more independent basis.
I make no secret of the fact that to my mind, we should be thinking about whether we should adopt the US model of an independent agency which is established outside the Commission and undertakes impact assessments of legislation in line with a standardised procedure not only for the Commission but for all other institutions as well.
However, another key point based on our experience in the Committee on Legal Affairs is that impact assessments are not actually being carried out as standard on every Commission proposal.
I can cite two specific examples from the Directorate-General for Justice and one from the Internal Market Directorate-General that have remained in my memory.
I also think that it is important to give serious consideration to the possibility of carrying out impact assessments in comitology procedures too, as it is often here that the bureaucracy arises as a result of the comitology decisions and the associated burdens.
As to soft law, Mr Medina Ortega's report has my full backing.
Indeed, in the Committee on Legal Affairs we increasingly have the impression that the European Commission is misusing the instrument of soft law in order to circumvent Parliament's codecision rights.
It is not acceptable for the Commission to make decisions as a legislative body at the proposal of the Directorate-General for Competition on which it consults Parliament, yet this is not the case for recommendations relating to the internal market.
As my final point, I would like to draw attention to the issue of simplification.
We need an institutional agreement on simplification as a matter of urgency, as we have in other areas, in order to ensure that we have an efficient procedure.
We do not want to open a Pandora's box and instead of simplifying matters, end up with even greater complexity.
<D>
(NL) Madam President, Commissioners, the recent recall campaign by a toy manufacturer acted as an alarm bell, and rightly so.
It is now up to us to deal with this problem in a rational and well-considered manner.
If, after many years of effort to achieve a high degree of consumer protection, also with regard to product safety, we are still sometimes confronted with situations in which non-compliant goods are produced, imported and introduced onto the market, that is of course not an ideal situation.
Perhaps, however, it is not entirely possible to prevent this from happening.
Yet despite this, European citizens and European consumers can expect us to continue to deliver maximum effort in order to put a check on this.
In the case constituting the immediate cause for this debate, the products in question are toys from China.
In spite of this, I would like to make an appeal to the effect that we do not restrict ourselves to this - not to the fact that they come from China, because unsafe goods enter the market from other countries too.
In some instances, they are also manufactured by us.
It is better to come to effective agreements than to initiate protectionist campaigns.
Nor must we focus solely upon toys, even though one in four products in which a defect is identified is in fact a toy.
We must ensure that product safety is guaranteed on a general level.
We do not need to devise a new approach as such; rather, we must close the gaps in the existing system.
We are working to achieve this with the proposals from the Internal Market Package for Goods.
I would like to make it clear to everyone that these proposals were drawn up with the aim of enabling the internal market to operate more effectively.
We always incorporate a high degree of protection for the consumer as an objective in these proposals and it now appears that this is actually the case.
The internal market and consumer protection are therefore not conflicting issues, but rather are entirely congruous and this is a path that we must continue to follow.
I have just one question for the Commission, Madam President: in our joint resolution, we are calling for an assessment to be carried out in order to examine whether a voluntary safety marking is available in addition to the CE marking.
I would like to ask the Commissioners what their response to this is.
<D>
rapporteur. - Mr President, I would like to thank all my colleagues who spoke here tonight and, of course, Commissioner Kuneva for her constructive attitude that we have become familiar with since she came into office.
I have a couple of remarks.
Mrs Kauppi mentioned financial services.
The growing area of cross-border banking, insurance sales and wealth management which has some very sophisticated instruments is a growing problem.
The rules still confuse consumers even at a national level.
So I think that in this area we need a cross-border collective redress system as well, because it will make financial institutions more responsible and careful when they explain the rights and risks to the customer.
We all know the sad figures that tell us how citizens in Member States are afraid of buying goods and services across borders, which is completely due to a lack of confidence.
But I trust that, when we proceed in the good mood in which we have discussed this report among ourselves and with the Commission, we can only succeed in building more confidence among European consumers.
<D>
- (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, despite all the current efforts of the European Council and the Commission, some Member States remain without supplies of Russian gas, their economies are at risk and people are afraid of freezing.
This is a high price to pay for the European Union's short-sighted foreign and energy policy.
And, unfortunately, it is being paid by the weakest.
Ladies and gentlemen, empty gas pipelines, production cuts and chilly schools are the price of the unnecessary Russophobia that is harboured by those members of the Union who have opposed the resumption of strategic partnership negotiations with Russia.
It is the price of our uncritical support for the orange segment in the Ukrainian political spectrum, and for trying to manage policy on Eastern Europe from Brussels.
It is the price of our fanatical rejection of nuclear energy.
Furthermore, it is the price of the long-term efforts to interfere in the national energy policies of individual Member States.
What advice would you give to the Slovak Prime Minister Fico, who now faces a 'Sophie's Choice'?
While temperatures are 20 degrees below and the gas has stopped flowing from the East, the Commission in Brussels is threatening to penalise Slovakia if it restarts the nuclear power plant in Jaslovské Bohunice.
Is it really meant to stand by while factories collapse and people freeze during the 20 days of reserves that remain to Slovakia?
Ladies and gentlemen, we are now seeing the importance of energy self-sufficiency for each State in the European Union.
How nice it is to have a warm home-spun shirt instead of a threadbare EU overcoat.
We should learn the lessons from this and avoid the transfer of energy-related powers to Brussels, as sought for under the Treaty of Lisbon.
<D>
Today, there was a report in a Dutch newspaper about an asparagus farmer who was taken into custody because she was suspected of human trafficking and of using slave labour by Romanians, in other words, European citizens.
Human trafficking is not just something that takes place with citizens of countries outside the Union, but also with those of countries within it.
A well-integrated policy on combating human trafficking cannot simply be limited to taking traffickers like this one into custody and robustly tackling those who commit such crimes, but must also properly focus on the victims.
Their rights and their future must be top priority.
Victims of human trafficking should never get the impression that they are alone or that they have been left in the lurch.
We must support them in all kinds of ways: legally, medically, socially and in communities and financially, and we should possibly also compensate them.
The ability of these victims to take possession of their rights and make use of the opportunities that our law allows for is crucial in any new directive.
I heard good things from Mr López Garrido and Mr Barrot in this regard.
The Commissioner also said that people who use the services of people who have been trafficked should face stiffer penalties.
For me, stiffer penalties for such activities are certainly not wrong, but I do wonder how we help the victims if we further criminalise their function, their work - as it is still work, even if it is slave work.
How does it help the victims if they have to be afraid that the work that they are doing at that point in time is being criminalised still further?
I would appreciate an answer to this question.
In the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance's book, victims of human trafficking have a right to a residence permit, a permanent residence permit under certain circumstances, in order to ensure that they do not have to be afraid of being sent back to the country where it all started and in order to ensure that they are able to bring charges against the trafficker, as they are safe in the knowledge that their stay in the country is secure.
This is because there must not be even a small chance that anyone is sent back and then comes across the trafficker again.
Your new framework directive, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, must be about empowering the victims.
It must give them rights and a new future.
That is what I would like to see.
<D>
Every report on Turkey is an expression of the EU's imperialist competitive designs on that country.
This particular report has opted to support the Turkish Government by trying to place undue emphasis on the progress Turkey is making in various areas, which is contrary to reality.
As usual, the report sings the praises of democratic rights, despite the well-known autocratic, repressive policy of the Turkish Government, as was recently proved by the brutal suppression of the May Day demonstrations.
The report tolerates Turkey's anti-Kurdish policy.
The report indirectly supports Turkish attacks on Iraqi territory.
While condemning the 'violence' perpetrated by the PKK and 'other terrorist groups', it merely advises the Turkish army not to engage in any 'disproportionate military operations'.
The report glosses over the continuing Turkish occupation of Cyprus and avoids categorically and unconditionally demanding the withdrawal of Turkish military forces.
The report welcomes Turkey's active participation in the imperialist missions and interventions of the EU and NATO.
Given Turkey's position in the imperialist system and its competitiveness in the wider arena, the EU aims to use the accession process to its advantage in order to gain control of the energy and geostrategic resources in the same arena.
For these reasons we are voting against the report.
<D>
rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I must tell you that I had an enormous amount of pleasure in applying, myself, the principles of governance during the preparation of this report with the various stakeholders.
Additionally, this method of working demonstrated its value in the preparation of the report, because it enabled me to take into account almost all the proposals made by my fellow Members, and on 9 September that was reflected in a unanimous vote within the Committee on Regional Development.
This consensus would, however, be worthless had it not found concrete form in a text that is both specific and consistent, as I will demonstrate to you in a moment.
I would therefore like to give my very hearty thanks to all my fellow Members who participated in this report, and in particular to the shadow rapporteurs, who would very much have liked to have been here this evening to display their commitment.
Commissioner, all my thanks go, of course, to the Commission departments, and I would be grateful to you if you would pass them on, since this cooperation has been both constructive and pleasant.
I will also thank the European Economic and Social Committee and its rapporteur, Mr van Iersel, the Committee of the Regions, Mr Kisyov, and the many bodies that have played a part.
So, what are governance and partnership about?
Well, we need to draw up an own-initiative report on this issue of governance and partnership because 'governance' and 'partnership' are terms that are used every day.
You only have to pick up the newspapers or reports and you will always come across those words.
Commissioner, there is a time for words and there is a time for action.
There is a time for setting targets and there is a time for giving oneself the means to achieve them.
For some years now we have been hearing the constant refrain that governance must be improved.
It is incorporated into our regulations, it is discussed in our debates, but not much progress is made.
What is really happening, when we see that the integrated approach appears in the many reports issued by the Commission and Parliament?
Do our European policies on transport, the environment and regional development really take account of one another?
Where is the integrated approach that we are hoping to see?
Each policy has its own budget, its own minister, its own Commissioner and its own timetable.
We can also see, just in relation to the Structural Funds, that the ERDF, the ESF and the EAFRD are applied on the ground separately.
Commissioner, in carrying out your duties, with your colleagues, you know that we all consider it very important to attain the Lisbon objectives.
If we go on in this way, though, with such a compartmentalised approach on the ground, do you believe that this will be possible?
Do you believe that an organisation, regardless of how powerful and how determined it is, can succeed by allowing this 'each for himself' approach to be adopted on the ground?
Today, the time has come for the various private and public stakeholders to bring together our skills and to bring together our budgets and our timetables when we are involved in the same subject in the same geographical area.
My report puts forward 37 specific actions intended to achieve this, but I am not going to list them, I am just going to indicate three key points.
The first key point is to give the various stakeholders, whether private, public, individuals or organisations, the means to implement this governance.
The first point, and I stressed this to your colleague, Mrs Danuta Hübner, is to develop a practical guide to governance.
No longer are we talking about abstract messages - this must be a practical guide.
The second point is the training of elected representatives within the framework of an Erasmus programme.
Our local and regional elected representatives should be the real engines for change in this new governance of the territories.
In addition - and this is the second key point - our European and national institutions must set an example.
That is why I call in my report for an annual meeting of the ministers responsible for cohesion policies within the Council.
Commissioner, as you know yourself, there are also differences between the Commissioners and the various directorates-general.
We need to have more effective inter-departmental work.
As for the Committee of the Regions, it has anticipated my request because two weeks ago it responded to our proposals.
Thirdly, it will of course be necessary, Commissioner, to have binding procedures.
Since my time has run out, I will not be able to go into them in more detail, but please note that we expect the Commission to act now as the spearhead for this revolution in current practices.
We must move on from words to actions.
I and my fellow Members who have worked on these texts expect the Commission to take decisions that are both swift and effective.
<D>
(PL) Mr President, one of the fundamental difficulties I should like to highlight is the lack of legal certainty.
The Commission has not established clearly which aspects of the organisation of sport are covered by Community legislation and which are of a purely sporting nature and therefore fall within the competence of the sports organisations.
I share the rapporteur's opinion that relying exclusively on the European Court of Justice does not provide further legal clarity.
The European Commission's stance whereby regulation of the organisation of sport must comply with the Treaties does not do so either.
This is not enough.
I therefore support the appeal to the European Commission to adopt interpretative guidelines that will bring clarity and precision to operations in this field.
It should of course be emphasised that any action by the Commission must comply with the principle of self-regulation in sport.
It must also respect the structures of the European sport model and the fundamental principles governing the organisation of sporting competitions.
I disagree with the views of certain sports organisations that believe that there would be more disputes in court following some kind of consolidation or codification of principles relating to the activities of sport beyond the strictly sporting context, complying of course with the principles of self-regulation.
In my opinion, the opposite would be the case.
Greater legal certainty can only be beneficial.
I should also like to appeal to sports organisations to accept the right of appeal to the common courts.
Every individual has the right to appeal to the courts.
The competence of tribunals of a strictly sporting nature is not at issue, but the restriction of these rights by certain sports organisations is unacceptable.
Finally, I should like to raise another very important matter.
Sport plays a very important role in society.
The Member States should therefore retain the right to take measures aimed at protecting the right to information and ensuring viewers' access to television broadcasts of major sport events.
I have in mind the Olympic Games and the European Championship or World Cup.
Everyone should be able to access such events freely.
Before I conclude, I must thank Mr Mavrommatis for his excellent work on this report.
<D>
- (EL) Madam President, the topic of today's discussion is misconceived.
Success in the age of globalisation safeguards neither European interests nor the prosperity of workers in EU countries, but only the interests of capital.
In the context of globalisation, the new order being created by business interests and multinational companies at Community and international level aims to multiply the profits of capital through the intensified exploitation of workers.
Mr Sarkozy's statements yesterday about globalisation confirm the EU's reliance on big capital.
They underline the intensity of intra-imperialist conflicts and the intention to use the EU as a battering ram against other large imperialist centres, and especially against the achievements and rightful claims of workers.
The common denominator of all these endeavours is a full-on attack on workers.
Reduced wages, increased working hours, adaptation to the needs of capital, an increased pension age, flexicurity and the restructuring of labour relations are at the core of the Lisbon Strategy.
We therefore consider that the harsh reality experienced by millions of workers cannot be judged by any terms of globalisation.
Nor is anyone convinced by the arguments put forward by the Commission and the Council about environmental protection.
<D>
President-in-Office of the Council. - (SL) Thank you very much, Mr President, for allowing me to speak.
I should also like to thank all our colleagues who have taken part in the debate.
Let me start by making one thing clear.
Nobody in the Council, neither the Presidency nor any Member State, supports the continuation, or even the occurrence, of fraudulent conduct in the internal market constituted by the European Union.
Quite the reverse, and that is why this debate is so welcome, and why I personally welcome it on behalf of the Presidency.
Secondly, I can assure you that the Presidency has taken note of the unanimous demands for increased activity and immediate action.
You can rely on us to pass these demands on to our partners in the Council.
Thirdly, I am delighted that the Committee on Petitions has decided to prepare a special report, and we look forward with pleasure to this report by Mr Busuttil.
This should generate additional impetus for appropriate activities at European level.
However, I should like to emphasise one thing.
Mrs McCarthy, you mentioned the example set by Austria.
Good examples certainly serve to encourage others to follow them.
And I also believe and hope that this debate will play a part in this.
I must stress, however, that the Commission is responsible for transposition of the directives.
As has already been mentioned, and as you also thought in your question, this issue involves two directives.
The Unfair Commercial Practices Directive does not cover this segment.
One solution would be either to redefine the concept of the consumer or to extend the scope of application of the Directive.
I expect both these options to be on the table when a decision is taken on these matters.
We are aware that the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive has not been in place for long.
It has only been in force since December, and I think we shall soon have to assess how it is being applied.
Secondly, I wish to stress again that the Misleading Advertising Directive covers this area.
Swindles and fraud of this kind definitely involve misleading advertising, which means that certain legal remedies are already available.
Finally, let me stress again that I have followed the debate very attentively, and that the Presidency will convey the mood of this plenary to Council members.
<D>
The European Union, through the Commission and the Member States combined, is the world's largest donor of humanitarian aid, contributing more than 40% of all official international assistance.
In 2009 alone, the Commission provided a total of EUR 950 million to approximately 115 million people in more than 70 countries.
The Union's policies are the practical expression of its genuine commitment to supporting people when they are at their most vulnerable.
Our aim is to be able to plan a more coordinated civil and military response so that our intervention with regard to natural disasters becomes increasingly effective.
These tragic events are occurring more and more frequently and have caused hundreds of thousands of deaths throughout the world in recent years.
Particular attention must be paid to women and children, especially refugees and displaced persons, as violations of international humanitarian law in relation to these groups are becoming increasingly common.
As well as ensuring more effective intervention, a great deal of work must be done in the area of active and passive prevention.
Those communities that are at greatest risk must be better prepared for this kind of phenomenon, through the promotion of all sustainable development policies aimed at minimising damage.
<D>
Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, I should like to thank all the speakers, whose contributions illustrate the extent of this shared desire to develop the use of our railways significantly.
For the benefit of Mr Jarzembowski and Mr Savary, I would add that the Commission has undertaken to present a report 30 months after the directive has been adopted, with, if necessary, legislative proposals based on the European Railway Agency's recommendations.
With regard to the certification of train drivers, our aim is to create a Europe-wide rail area and so, of course, we want to promote mobility for railway personnel.
Obviously, ladies and gentlemen, all this will work only if the Member States supply the necessary investment because we cannot have a successful railway policy until we make the trans-European networks a reality, and guarantee interoperability on all the major lines, notably through the ERTMS.
Clearly the duty to invest is crucial.
Investment is the price to be paid for giving full effect to the texts that you are about to adopt.
In relation to freight traffic by rail, there was, indeed, an initial proposal for a regulation on compensation for failure to meet commitments on service quality in this sector.
Subsequently, while recognising that the aims were sound, Parliament and the Council decided that the measure proposed was inappropriate.
Nonetheless, I have to say that I will continue to pay close attention to the development of freight traffic on the railways.
I am still concerned about problems of punctuality and the reliability of goods transport services by rail.
So I will submit a report towards the end of 2007 on the development of service quality and on suitable measures to tackle the problems.
This will obviously lead the Commission to propose a European railway network with a focus on freight.
I hope to present the report in October.
As many of you have said, any compromise is clearly just a step and may be seen to be limited, but a step can also be seen as a measure of progress.
For my own part, I am convinced that by adopting this third Railway Package, Parliament will send out a powerful signal to the people of Europe, who can make much greater use of rail as a means of travel.
I would add that we are in the process of establishing passengers' rights, based on the notion of European citizenship.
With regard to aircraft passengers, much remains to be done in order to give effect to the law.
In the case of rail passengers, they obviously need to be supplied with clear, straightforward information enabling them to understand what they are entitled to expect.
I believe, however, that we are effectively sending out a strong signal by demonstrating that we are determined to press ahead with development of a proper passengers' charter to give everyone - including the least advantaged - greater access to mobility.
Such is my conviction and I would conclude, Mr President, by thanking once again all the Members of the House, whose observations will assist us in the process of closely monitoring how these texts are applied.
<D>
Mr President, I was elected in June to represent the South West of England and Gibraltar and during the election campaign, I was saddened by the large number of people I met who no longer support Britain's membership of the EU.
It saddened me because I believe that the EU has been a force for good in the world.
It has promoted peace and reconciliation amongst the peoples of Europe.
I hope it will continue to do so.
The single market promotes trade and prosperity; world-leading companies such as Airbus in my constituency have shown what we can achieve when we pool our industrial resources.
When I was a student, I lived in France for 12 months and I came home a Francophile.
I want Britain to enjoy warm and friendly relationships with all our European neighbours.
My concern is that the current march towards political union without the support of the peoples of Europe threatens to undermine the good work that the EU has done.
I respect the fact that the Irish people have now voted in favour of the Lisbon Treaty, though I think it disgraceful that they were pressurised into holding a second vote by countries which had not even held one referendum.
The conduct of Gordon Brown is particularly reprehensible.
His legacy to Britain will be not only to leave us bankrupt but also to deny the British people a vote on this latest transfer of power from Westminster to Brussels.
Breaking his promise to hold a referendum threatens to undermine British support for the EU and I deeply regret that.
I cannot understand why those in favour of political union seem determined to build this structure on the worst possible foundations.
Do they not understand that a political union built without popular support is likely to end in failure?
<D>
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, I am very grateful that there is a growing recognition of the need to handle and care for animals properly.
Good animal husbandry is something that Irish farm families have as a rule practised and I commend them for this.
However, I would like to stress the necessity for animals and animal products coming into the EU to abide by similar welfare standards to those that the EU requires.
It is not fair that animal products which may have been produced in the most cheap and cruel ways come into the EU and compete with our own animal products produced in accordance with standards which are strictly regulated; this kind of competition is not only economically unfair, it puts our animals and even our people at danger of the spread of disease.
A measure discussed in this House which is unrealistic for Irish farmers is the set limit for animal transport.
While a nine-hour limit between breaks may be reasonable for land transport, it is virtually impossible to abide by this limit for sea transport from Ireland - remember Ireland is an island.
We depend on sea transport of animals and such a limit would ultimately prevent Irish horse breeders and farmers from shipping animals.
Thus I would like to propose that we focus more on the quality of travel accommodation of these animals, instead of on the time on board, so that we do not hinder the transportation of animals to and from Ireland.
Finally, while I was glad to see the new animal health strategy open to all animals within the EU, I would have liked to see more specific mention of the procurement and handling of pet animals.
I think that many of them suffer in our countries.
Pet owners are amateurs in many cases and are less likely to know how to handle and maintain their pets, which often leads to an increase in animal cruelty, often unintentional.
So while we have paid very close attention to the regulation of animals coming into the EU, animal transport etc., we have neglected to look at the plight of pets and strays, an issue often mentioned by my constituents who point out the common occurrence of abuse.
<D>
rapporteur. - Mr President, in the Committee on Budgets, we voted on more than 1 600 amendments to the 2011 draft budget.
Inevitably, there are some technical adjustments that should be voted in the plenary.
As far as the integration of Letter of amendment No 1 for 2011 in Parliament's reading is concerned, some technical adjustments need to be made in both the new European External Action Service section and that of the Commission, following the proposed transfers of appropriations between sections.
In the European External Action Service section, these concern notably the budgeting of the 1.85% salary adjustment for the new Service, as is the case for the other institutions.
The amounts affected by the letter of amendment in the Commission section will also need to be modified accordingly.
This also applies to some Parliament amendments on administrative lines, which need to be aligned with the final amounts presented in the budget lines of Section III.
For the agencies, the remarks following certain agencies' budget lines will be technically adjusted to make them consistent with the final figures adopted.
In line 02 01 04 04, remarks adopted in Amendment 996 should be added as such to Amendment 1010 on operational line 02 02 01 (as part of the package on pilot projects and preparatory actions).
In line 19 05 01, the words 'other than the United States' should be deleted from the heading and the remarks, as decided by the Committee on Budgets.
In line 19 09 01, an oral amendment adopted in the Committee on Budgets should be inserted in the remarks.
The following words should be added: 'part of this appropriation is intended to support, amongst others, initiatives such as the EU-LAC Foundation decided at the summit of EU-LAC Heads of States and Governments and the Biarritz Forum'.
It is necessary to renumber some budget lines in order to avoid contradictory numbering of some lines created and to follow nomenclature rules.
This will affect neither the multiannual financial framework headings nor the budgetary chapter of the amendments adopted in the Committee on Budgets.
This concerns Amendments 386, 389, 521, 833, 997, 998, 999, 1016, 1018, 1021, 1022, 1023 and 1024.
<D>
President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, in my final remarks I would like to stress that the Council welcomes Parliament's wish to make early progress in these important files and its recognition of the importance for the proper functioning of the common European asylum system.
I can assure you that the Council will now carefully consider the position which Parliament has taken on the proposals in the work which is ongoing within the framework of the relevant Council bodies.
The Council will in particular examine in detail Parliament's amendments with a view to establishing whether an agreement is possible on those proposals on which work is most advanced.
Let me also comment on the principle of solidarity.
A few honourable Members rightly point out that some Member States, because of their geographical and demographic situation, really experience particular pressure on their asylum systems.
In that light, the European Council stressed the principle of solidarity in the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum adopted in autumn 2008.
The Pact clearly calls for solidarity on a voluntary and coordinated basis towards better relocation of beneficiaries of international protection, as well as approved legislation, such as the part of the programme 'solidarity and management of migration flows', and provides for financing of such activities in which the Member States can participate, again on a voluntary basis.
It should be noted that the European Asylum Support Office can be instrumental in these intra-Community transfers by facilitating the exchange of information on such transfers.
Moreover, the Office can help by coordinating the deployment of officials from other Member States to Member States under particular pressure.
However, this regulation cannot serve as a legal basis creating an intra-Community transfer mechanism.
Let me say at the end of my remarks that further work is ahead of us in the area, as the Commission has already announced its intention to table further legislative proposals for the purpose of completing the common European asylum system.
These proposals will concern asylum procedures and the standards for qualification and status for the qualification of applicants as refugees, as well as the establishment of resettlement schemes for people under the protection of the UNHCR.
We need to make progress as quickly as possible, while ensuring that speed does not compromise quality.
That is something on which I am confident we can all agree.
<D>
(BG) I would like to congratulate the rapporteur Mrs. Jäätteenmäki for that fact that since the Lisbon Treaty and the Charter of Fundamental Rights were signed a new framework on the Ombudsman's role in modern social relations has been proposed.
I am confident that this document will contribute to the more efficient execution of his duty and will make him an actual guarantor of effective protection for European citizens against cases of bad governance on the part of European institutions
Both our discussions and the report focus on the sensitive topic of the Ombudsman's access to information, including classified information.
In my opinion, if the Ombudsman's work is to be done effectively and if we are to ensure the best possible result in the inquest into objective truth, which is primarily in the public interest, European institutions should have the obligation to provide access to any type of information.
At the same time, however, the Ombudsman must be informed of the type of such information, especially in cases where it is confidential.
Indeed, it is very important to respect citizens' privacy, particularly when using classified information.
I think that the rapporteur has managed to strike a balance between personal rights and public interest.
This provides the Ombudsman with access to the entire information on a given case, so that he or she can rule on it while at the same time there is compliance with all rules which are followed also by those institutions providing such information, and this will ensure both the protection of the information involved and the protection of European citizens' rights.
Strengthening the Ombudsman's role as a mediator between the European institutions and the citizens will make a contribution to the development of democracy and reinforce the principles of rule of law.
That is why it is very important that he or she is present not only at the European but at the national level as well, especially in countries where democratic principles and supervision are still in the process of being built and where government structures cannot provide effective remedy for their citizens at the national level, yet those citizens are also citizens of the European Union.
That is why I would like to stress on the need to improve cooperation between the EU institutions and the Ombudsman.
Contacts between the Ombudsman and Committee on Petitions of the European Parliament are particularly important; they need to cooperate in the interest of European citizens.
It is also important to develop and implement a more effective system of practical mechanisms for cooperation.
<D>
The European Commission's draft budget for 2011 is not up to the challenges confronting Europe.
When we have EUR 142 billion of commitments - that is, 1.15% of Europe's GNI - the Commission proposes to finance new priorities, as well as programmes already included in the financial framework for 2007-2013, by taking from the funds of existing programmes and from a budget margin that has been reduced to virtually nothing.
The 2020 agenda for growth and employment, which is supposed to be the Union's road map for the next ten years, and the fight against climate change cannot truly take place without financial resources.
It is not acceptable to finance the upcoming instrument for cooperation with industrialised countries by taking money from development aid.
It is not realistic to reduce European financial aid for the Middle East peace process by a third.
This is not a serious approach.
We were expecting more boldness from the Commission.
Yet the European Parliament is still waiting for a draft mid-term review of the financial perspectives, something that there is a great need for in Europe.
This question must have a central role in the upcoming budgetary negotiations with the Council.
The delegation of the Democratic Movement to Parliament will be fighting in favour of this.
<D>
- (PL) Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to begin my speech by quoting from a poem written by Osip Mandelstam, one of the greatest Russian poets of the 20th century.
I will quote the words in the language in which they were written, and so in Russian:
(the Member then spoke in Russian)
They are terrible words.
For that poem Osip Mandelstam was sent into exile.
He died near Vladivostok, on the way to his destination.
In December 1938 his body was placed in a common grave.
Osip Mandelstam symbolises the millions of victims of 20th-century totalitarian regimes in Europe.
The Europe of today should remember the victims of 20th-century totalitarian regimes worldwide.
Those victims are today the foundation of our memory, the lasting spiritual basis of European democracy.
At the same time we see the entire history of the 20th century.
We remember the victims of authoritarian systems, the victims in European countries, in nationalistic and militaristic regimes, in Spain, in Portugal and in Greece.
I would like to draw attention to a seminar held in our group, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, and to a book devoted to problems of history and politics which our group is going to publish.
We want to face up to this problem seriously.
We are opposed to the manipulation of that memory, and to the insulting of that memory, where it is used today in an ideological battle, in a party fight in the European political system.
We remember the victims.
The victims of 20th-century totalitarian regimes must be the foundation of today's democracy in Europe.
<D>
I supported the adoption of the report drawn up by Jutta Haug and Janusz Lewandowski on the EU draft budget for 2009.
It is important that, ultimately, MEPs were able to reach a compromise with the Council with regards to the funding of Parliament's priority objectives, such as combating the impact of the economic recession, and action to promote economic growth, cohesion and employment.
Parliament will increase the financial resources earmarked for social and employment policy, namely activities to promote competition and cohesion.
This expenditure will cover the Social Fund, which will receive an additional EUR 135 million, as well as the Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund.
In the current, difficult financial situation throughout the whole of the European Union, initiatives to promote development and employment are of paramount importance, and this must be reflected in the 2009 budget.
It is laudable that the budget also intends to earmark additional funds for providing assistance to SMEs.
Developing countries will be able to count on financial aid to alleviate the effects of sudden increases in food prices, and an additional EUR 1 billion will also be earmarked for efforts to prevent famine in the Developing World.
I also welcome the fact that Parliament intends to limit its administrative spending and to restrict this sum to under 20% of its total expenditure.
<D>
(FR) Mr Kouchner, ladies and gentlemen, in January this year, as rapporteur on the South Caucasus, I became aware of the danger of an unrestrained arms race and stressed the importance of a peaceful resolution to the conflicts inherited from the Soviet era.
We suggested organising a three-plus-three conference, in other words the three countries of the Caucasus plus the European Union, Russia and the US.
Since then, as recalled by Mrs Isler, we have proposed to grant the same visa rights to Georgians as to Abkhazians.
We are now all well aware of what has happened - a military action and a disproportionate response - but the fact remains that two countries which had said that they wanted to abide by European values, by becoming members of the Council of Europe, have flouted these principles by using violence.
This is unacceptable.
This must be denounced and cannot be forgotten overnight.
Europe, which has important relations with both countries, must play a careful and considered role to ensure that they return to a more reasonable policy.
This is why it was important to speak with one voice and I am very happy that this was possible, even without the Lisbon Treaty ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
<D>
(NL) The current fisheries policy is not working well enough; a dramatic change is needed to reverse the situation.
This is the fairly strong wording with which the European Commission opens its Green Paper.
This is remarkable.
Not that I wish to argue with it; on the contrary.
Some say the main reason for the failure of the common fisheries policy (CFP) is not that the policy as such is wrong but that it is so poorly implemented and enforced.
There are important lessons to be learned in this regard.
Policy must lend itself to implementation, and so simplification is in order.
That is why I am pleased with the direction the Commission is indicating: regionalisation, more involvement by the sector and, in particular, compliance with the rules.
The report on this Green Paper by my fellow Portuguese Member points out the large variations between the various fleets and fisheries; and rightly so.
We cannot talk in generalised terms about the overcapacity or the overfishing or the lack of compliance.
A regional, sector-specific approach calls for nuanced language in this respect.
Last Saturday, in fact, I held intensive discussions with representatives of the sector, who told me that fishermen and scientists are cooperating more and more successfully.
Indeed, this strikes me as an example of how things can be done.
When fishermen are able to contribute their know-how and to help shape policy, this broadens the basis for the policy considerably, and will put us on the right track.
Finally, I should like to offer the rapporteur sincere thanks for this excellent report.
<D>
The European Union Lisbon Summit in March 2000 set the strategic objectives for the following ten years as the achievement of sustainable economic development, the creation of more and better jobs and the improvement of social cohesion.
Based on the so-called Barcelona objectives, which the Member States accepted in 2002 concerning childcare facilities, by 2010, Member States should guarantee child care for at least 90% of children between the age of 3 and compulsory school attendance age and at least 33% of children under the age of 3.
In order to achieve the Barcelona objectives, an open co-ordination method was applied, but measures for reaching the objective were left to the discretion of each Member State.
Thus one must now recognise that several Member States are still quite far from reaching this objective and, as a result, the objectives approved in 2002 need to be reviewed now.
The present recession proves that disturbances in the financial market have noticeable negative side-effects on the real economy.
The negative influences on economic growth and employment are sufficiently serious, and are now influencing the achievement of the Lisbon objectives in Member States.
Since most EU States have now directed their attention and also their financial resources towards the struggle with the economic crisis, it is important that in the framework of that activity the Barcelona objectives should not be forgotten, since achieving them also supports the achievement of the Lisbon objectives.
The present situation also bears witness to the fact that we will not fully achieve this objective in the Member States by merely setting new dates for the Barcelona objectives.
In this area, another important issue for Member States is the EU's supporting back-up measures, which will help towards achieving objectives for childcare facilities in all Member States.
<D>
in writing. - (RO) Only one year after its establishment, in 2006, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is already requested.
I welcome the voting of the decision to mobilize the fund, which represents a first attempt to support our European citizens who face the challenges of globalisation.
Globalisation is a phenomenon that offers us numerous chances and opportunities, but also generates difficulties of adjustment to its consequences.
Therefore, it is very important for the European Union to be capable not only of responding to such challenges, but also to approach them efficiently by fast mobilization of the necessary financial instruments.
European citizens' safety and confidence in the future lie at the basis of our actions and initiatives.
I am very pleased to welcome the orientation of this fund toward the field of labour and labour safety, but I also emphasize the importance of education in this field and the need to take into consideration this area, as well, in the future fund mobilizations.
At the end, I hope that in the future, in case of need, each EU Member State will benefit from the mobilization of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, whose less positive effects affect us all, including in the new Member States.
This is the only way in which we will be able to build true sustainable development over the entire EU territory.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, strict Parliament rules do not allow me to reply to your speeches in detail.
However, allow me to thank you for the substantial debate, which analysed many aspects of the labour market and of the European Employment Strategy, and allow me to talk about just a few fundamental issues.
Firstly, the European Employment Strategy has brought tangible results.
The current statistics on unemployment and employment are much better than they have been since the 1980s, which is a clear success.
In your debate you often expressed your worries concerning quality jobs.
I want to point out that the concept of more jobs and more quality jobs is a part of the Lisbon Strategy for growth and employment.
What is the result?
Of the millions of new jobs, more than half are full-time jobs and there can be no question marks over their quality.
Many of the remaining jobs are part-time jobs or fixed-term jobs.
In my opinion, the hypothesis that none of the fixed-term and part-time jobs is a high-quality job does not hold water.
It is not tenable.
Many of these jobs are quality jobs.
However, there is no doubt that some of these jobs are not quality jobs and this is one of the areas that we must sort out.
My personal view is that the problem of the working poor, that is, the people who continue to be poor despite having a job, is very worrying and we have to pay more attention to it.
According to the available data, the working poor account for approximately 8% of the working population, which is a considerable amount.
We are talking about millions of people and this is a very pressing issue.
Another issue you debated is the link between employment policies and social inclusion.
Let me point out that Guideline No 19 puts emphasis on an inclusive labour market and on promoting the inclusion of disadvantaged people in the labour market.
This is because the Commission recommended in the Strategy that substantial changes should not be made to these Guidelines.
This is because they have proved to be successful and because it has become clear that in order to ensure good governance, a better balance between European and national level (indeed, most Member States expressed such views), it would be best not to expand the Guidelines.
On the other hand, it is clear that the text is not cast in stone, that it will continue to develop and that the topics you mentioned are undoubtedly the topics that will require an appropriate response in accordance with future developments.
I would like to answer another question concerning the application of Article 139 of the Treaty.
Paradoxically, the collective agreement in the maritime sector will be signed today, and it has already been decided to introduce this collective agreement into European legislation through Article 139.
In other words, this is a concrete step showing that this article has not been neglected.
By the way, I see the maritime sector agreement as an extremely important step forward because this is a very complex and highly international sector, and the social partners have managed to achieve a significant amount.
Of course there were other topics in the debate: the issue of education, the significant number of early school leavers, lifelong learning.
All these topics are important and to a certain extent will be included in the new social agenda.
Regarding inclusion, I would like to draw your attention to the Commission communication on active inclusion, which is one of the documents outlining the Commission's strategy in this area.
Let me stress that although the labour market is the basis for active inclusion, it does not extend to all areas where the application of a coherent inclusion policy is needed.
Since there are clearly many people who are outside the labour market for natural reasons, such as pensioners or people who find themselves in various unusual circumstances, the inclusion policy must cover more than just the labour market.
The European labour market strategy clearly has to take this aspect into account.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you once more for the debate, which, in my opinion, covered most of the important topics concerning the European labour market.
I think that they make a significant contribution to the process of finding a better and more effective balance between the European Employment Strategy and the activities of the individual Member States.
As I said before, there were many very interesting comments made in the course of the debate but Parliament's rules make it impossible for me to respond to all of them, which is why I responded to only a few.
<D>
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, as Chairman of the Delegation for relations with the countries of South Asia, I join the Council and the Commission in the condemnation of the murder of Benazir Bhutto.
This Parliament has always condemned terrorism wherever it occurs and we will continue to fight for the right of politicians to express their views and to campaign in safety.
In going back to Pakistan, Benazir Bhutto knew the risks and, whether you consider her to be brave or foolhardy, you have to respect her commitment to her party and her country.
In her memory and the memory of others who have died in this election period, I believe it is beholden on all of us - Europeans and Pakistanis from President Musharraf downwards - to do everything we can to assist Pakistan.
As Mr Lenarčič said, the key to this must be the continuing battle against terrorism.
We have seen that terrorism is a threat in Pakistan as much as it is in Europe or the USA.
Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner has reminded us that hundreds of innocent civilians have been killed in shootings and suicide bombs in Pakistan, so Europe must continue to fully assist and support the counter-terrorism operations in Pakistan.
Some colleagues here might suggest we should leave Pakistan be and have little to do with it, but I firmly believe the contrary.
As 27 strong democratic nations, we need to work collectively to support the economic, social and political developments in Pakistan.
Again, I agree with the Council: the release of all remaining political detainees will be crucial to this process, as will ensuring free, fair, transparent and safe elections on 18 February 2008 and a safe and satisfactory run-up to that date.
In addition to what the Commissioner said, I think the election will mean that we need to have 90 million voters with proper access to news coverage of all sides of the debate.
It means making a safer environment for the media.
Pakistan has become the most dangerous Asian country for the media: at least six journalists were killed in 2007, some 30 seriously injured, over 100 arrested and countless harassed.
We need an end to the censorship of the print and broadcast media and to restrictions on what they can say and do without interference from the military or civilian authorities.
The ban on the TV news station GEO News needs to be lifted and the government television channel PTV needs to be more balanced in its news and the information it conveys to the public.
All arrangements for the actual voting, the counting and the reporting of the results need to be above board and clear to everyone, but most especially to the voters of Pakistan.
A mark of democracy is also whether incumbents can accept defeat and whether political transition from one party of government to another, if it occurs, can go smoothly.
All of these will be crucial factors in whether or not the elections can be counted as a true record of the will of the people and whether or not Pakistan can start to emerge from the long shadow cast by that assassin's bullet on 27 December 2007.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - The question the honourable Member has asked is not new, which shows that it is something that is very dear to the heart of MEPs.
I would recall the answer I gave to the questions by Mr Moraes on the Internet and hate crimes, by Luca Romagnoli on content and the use of blogs, and by Robert Kilroy-Silk on racism and violence on social websites.
I can tell you not only that those questions have been asked but also that the Commission has taken action in this area.
Speaking only about the social websites, some weeks ago, all the social networking site providers sat around a table and signed a code of conduct to help young children and adolescents to fight against negative content on these websites.
As you know, the Commission strongly rejects all racist and xenophobic views conveyed on the Internet, together with the types of hate speech cited by the honourable Member in his question.
As is often the case with the web, the picture is one of stark contrasts.
On the web, the best rubs shoulders with the worst: on the one hand, there are tremendous opportunities to diffuse and receive valuable, targeted information, for better social cohesion; on the other, it is an ideal forum for stereotypes, prejudices, derogatory views and even dangerous content, as was mentioned in the question.
Here lies the danger: should the State go and block access to websites or filter search-engine results?
This is already being done by authoritarian states.
In democratic countries, such as the EU Member States, restrictions on the freedom of speech are exceptional and governed by the rule of law.
It is worth noting that the Council of Europe has developed a series of international, legally binding instruments, directly and indirectly concerning the Internet.
These uphold the belief that cyberspace is not a lawless area, but is subject to the rule of law.
I would recall the Convention on Cybercrime and its additional protocol.
The Commission has also adopted policies aimed at reducing racist content online, notably the recommendation on the protection of minors and human dignity and the right of reply, which calls for action against discrimination in all media.
I would also like to draw attention to the Framework Decision on combating certain forms of expression of racism and xenophobia, which aims at criminalising intentional conduct, such as incitement to violence or hatred towards a group of people or against a person belonging to that group.
This is a criminal offence if committed by public dissemination or distribution of tracts, pictures or other material, and here, Member States have the obligation to comply with the provisions of the Framework Decision by 28 November 2010.
I could also underline that the European law already prohibits incitement to hatred on grounds of sex, race, religion or nationality in TV broadcasts and in TV online.
So we already have a whole series of mechanisms, a whole series of laws and a whole series of measures implementing these laws.
But as always with negative content - be it in the traditional media or on the Internet - it pops up more quickly than you can fight it.
<D>
in writing. - (PT) We cannot vote in favour of this fishing agreement, because we believe the sharing of fishing opportunities it establishes among the various Member States is disproportionate and inadequate, since it does not safeguard Portugal's legitimate interests.
This Partnership Agreement between the EC and Mozambique came into force on 1 January 2007 for a period of five years, and, compared with the previous agreement, it provides for an increase of 2 000 tonnes in the Community fishing quota for tuna or tuna-like species.
In the previous agreement, the extent to which Portugal used its entitlement to fishing opportunities (five) was rather high, which is why Portugal asked for nine licences for surface longliners, plus continuation of the opportunities in demersal freezer trawlers fishing for deep-water shrimp.
However, it was only awarded seven licences for tuna fishing.
Bearing in mind the previous distribution of licences and (non-)respect for the principle of relative stability in the light of the increase in fishing opportunities, this new agreement therefore involves a marked imbalance: Portugal only gains two more licences, while the other Member States gain a further 16 (France) and 13 (Spain).
If decisions in the Council required unanimity, that would not happen.
Hence our vote against.
<D>
(PL) Mr President, 69 000 people died as a result of the earthquake of 12 May 2008, over 18 000 are missing and the number of wounded is over 37 000.
This event has shaken not just the Chinese, but also the entire world.
I was probably the only person in the House today who was present at that time: I was in Beijing and Shanghai and I saw the solidarity of those people, the Chinese, who identified with the victims and the tragedy.
Taking advantage of this opportunity, I would like to express my admiration for the thousands of rescue personnel and volunteers from the whole world, from Taiwan, Japan, Australia and above all from China, whose solidarity and commitment in these tragic circumstances deserve special praise.
The actions taken by the European Union should also be recognised.
The Chinese government, with the support of local authorities, allocated the sum of EUR 10 billion to help disaster victims.
The total foreign support received by Beijing amounted to EUR 5 billion.
Most of these funds came from the Chinese diaspora living in different parts of the world.
I believe that activities directed towards specific humanitarian assistance are more useful, and that dialogue is more successful than slogans and calls for boycotts and protests.
<D>
Mr President, I would like to bring to your attention the fact that now we are actually going to have a referendum in Wales.
Yes, believe it or not, a referendum.
We were denied one on the Constitution, we were denied one on the Lisbon Treaty, but we are to have one in Wales on further powers for the Welsh Assembly.
Now that is the issue at stake, but there is a sting in the tail.
All the political parties in Wales - Labour, Plaid Cymru, Liberal Democrats and Conservatives - are supporting this and they are wishing for more powers.
Well, I have got news for them: I do not.
They are treating people in Wales like fools.
At a time now, when independence will be next on the agenda, we could end up having as many as 80 Assembly Members.
In Wales, we have care homes under threat, we have schools under threat of closure, our roads are like a Third World country, and yet our political class in Cardiff Bay, as over here, are determined to push ahead with this mad idea.
I welcome the fact that there is a referendum, but I hope the good people of Wales stand up and vote 'no'.
<D>
in writing. - The most important topic in the discussion about the future of the Europe 2020 strategy is the challenge of need and sustainability.
Clearly the Lisbon strategy has not delivered and now we have to be realistic if the future Europe 2020 would be able to deliver.
In order to make Europe 2020 a success story it is crucial that Member States, EU institutions and all actors in the society work on this together.
A top-down and bottom-up approach have to meet each other.
Realistic benchmarks have to be set to increase employment, especially youth employability.
Education systems in Europe need to become more oriented towards research and innovation; higher investment in education is unavoidable.
Better coherence needs to be created between the labour market and education.
The concept of life-long and life-wide learning are to be tackled seriously.
I strongly advocate better vocational education systems and support the need to work much closer with the private sector on this.
In the increasingly competitive world, Europe needs to be ambitious and committed on all levels.
Without this we will again have a strategy that resembles more the Soviet Union's five-year plans.
A convincing European strategy to create a stronger Europe should take leadership on global level.
<D>
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have paid close attention to all the speeches made here today on the imminent summit between the European Union and Russia and in general on relations between the EU and Russia and also on Russia's internal situation as you see it.
I must say that, as of course is my duty, I have duly noted and will take due account of these opinions.
In my view, there is one common thread running through all the comments and analyses made here today which is that Russia is a strategic partner for the European Union.
The EU needs Russia in the same way that Russia needs the EU.
It is based on this absolutely undeniable finding that we must build a relationship which is course mutually beneficial but which is also solid and firm, based on common values and principles.
Mention has been made of solidarity, human rights and reciprocity.
Now more than ever the European Union must stand firm before Russia in terms of its internal solidarity.
A problem for one Member State - and I have always said this - is a problem for all Member States.
This solidarity cannot under any circumstances be called into question.
On the issue of human rights, we all know that at the root of our Union lies respect for rule of law, democracy and human rights.
These are our inalienable values and principles which must guide our relations with third countries in all cases.
For our part, we must of course ensure reciprocity.
However, in so doing, we are also entitled to expect reciprocity from others.
If, at this moment in time, there are fracture lines as the Member has stated, I consider that the European Union and Russia can only stand to gain by doing everything possible within the reference framework that I mentioned, in other words a framework of solidarity, reciprocity and respect for human rights.
It is certainly essential for the European Union that these fractures are healed and so this is what we are going to work towards.
In our work we will naturally be aware of the difficulties and different goals, but we will also be determined as we are also aware that the current situation does not serve the best interests of the Union.
It is of course our duty to work in the interests of the European Union and we will do this openly and transparently, by talking face to face as we must always do with partners who we regard as strategic.
It will certainly be an intense and important dialogue.
We will talk about economics, trade, human rights and of course the international political situation and the regional political situation.
We hope - and this is what we will work towards - that, despite the difficulties, problems and differences of opinion, despite everything, we will be able, at the end of this summit on Friday, to say that some progress has been made in our relations and that, despite the difficulties, we have managed to achieve our objectives.
<D>
on behalf of the ITS Group. - (DE) Madam President, as we all know, it has long been presumed that a connection exists between pesticides used in agriculture or genetically modified foodstuffs on the one hand and various diseases on the other.
When pesticides are even being found here and there in drinking water, it is undoubtedly high time to make the slow-grinding wheels of EU bureaucracy turn faster.
It remains to be seen how far we can actually go towards achieving the present aim of reducing the application of plant protection agents.
We are all familiar, of course, with ambitious aims that are not achieved in the end.
I do believe, however, that the intended replacement of carcinogenic substances is far from the great achievement it is volubly proclaimed to be; on the contrary, it is, in my view, an immediate imperative.
In actual fact, the replacement of these substances is long overdue.
If we consider that the EU accounts for one quarter of all global pesticide use even though it possesses only 4% of the world's arable land, the problem becomes immediately clear.
These statistics also show that our EU support schemes have patently been steering conventional agriculture in the wrong direction.
There is, of course, a general suspicion among consumers - and it is not entirely unfounded - that resourceful farmers are trying to circumvent the prescribed ceilings with combinations of authorised plant protection products.
Given the lack of research into interaction between products, it is high time for intervention to curb such practices.
Moreover, the continual increases in maximum concentrations in recent years must be reversed in view of the greater danger posed to high-risk groups such as children.
Importing organic products from the opposite ends of the earth is not only inconsistent with various environmental objectives but is also one of the causes of increased traffic volumes and a perennial indictment of the Union's misguided support policy.
Our support schemes should therefore be rethought, particularly with a view to providing more support for those European farmers who refrain using pesticides.
If we choose instead to go on harassing farmers with bureaucratic obstacles, no one should be surprised if they ultimately throw in the towel in frustration while Brussels is bewildered by the chronic dwindling of the farming community.
<D>
on behalf of the ECR Group. - Madam President, I sympathise totally with the position that many German farmers find themselves in at the present time.
I had this experience about two years ago in Northern Ireland when we went through a very similar exercise.
The people who really suffered in this were the farmers who were not actually involved in any way at all.
I think the word 'criminal' has been mentioned here and there are those with criminal intent who have been involved in this.
We have to ask why they do it, and whether they are doing it to make a lot of extra money, as Mr Häusling says.
If they are, they should be prosecuted for it.
But we should make it very clear that it is not those who are producing food that are responsible.
It is the providers of the feed to those who are producing the food that are responsible.
We must take action against these people to make sure that it does not happen and to restore consumer confidence.
I can well understand why consumer confidence should be shaken at this moment.
As someone said, this has happened before and it should not be allowed to happen again.
Let us not simply go wholesale and bring in new legislation.
Let us implement what we have.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, Mr Onesta asked me how I read Rule 149(4).
I do understand that Mr Posselt and others are saying that we should act anyway, even if we do not keep to the Rules of Procedure.
I am delighted with the Member's argument: either we have Rules of Procedure and keep to them, or we do not keep to them and therefore do not need them.
I may be Chair of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, but it was Members before me who made this rule and adopted it in plenary with an absolute majority.
Paragraph 4 is quite clear.
It states: 'Members who have asked for the quorum to be established shall be counted as being present [...], even if they are no longer in the Chamber.'
That is clear.
If 40 Members, who were present at the sitting in Strasbourg, request that the vote or quorum be established, then they will be added to the number of those present.
That is how I read it.
If you wish to have it otherwise, then you have to change paragraph 4 but, as for now, it reads as it reads.
Mr Posselt, anyone who reads it must understand it that way; there is no other way to understand it.
Therefore, Mr President, now it is up to you to take a decision.
<D>
in writing. - The debate on the organisation of working time is complex.
But the most difficult issues are the future of the opt-out and the treatment of on-call time.
In the SIMAP and Jaeger cases the European Court of Justice interpreted the definition of working time in the original Working Time Directive to include the inactive part of on-call time when an employee is not working but resting.
In the Council agreement of 9 and 10 June 2008, the inactive part of on-call time is not regarded as working time, unless national law/practice/collective agreements or agreements between the social partners provide otherwise.
Under the Council agreement, the possibility for an employee to opt out of the maximum average working week of 48 hours, provided for in the original Working Time Directive, is subject to more stringent conditions in order to protect the health and safety of workers.
Employees will not be required to work in excess of 60 hours a week averaged over three months, or 65 hours a week averaged over three months, when the inactive part of on-call time is regarded as working time.
Ireland has never used the opt-out, so a stricter implementation of the available opt-out is both welcome and necessary.
<D>
The next item is the Council statement on the presentation of the programme of the French Presidency.
President Sarkozy, I would like to welcome you to the European Parliament as President-in-Office of the Council.
(Applause)
I am aware that you are joining us here today after a long journey from Japan.
Welcome to the European Parliament, President-in-Office.
(Applause)
I should also like to welcome the President of the European Commission, José Manuel Durão Barroso, who, like the President-in-Office of the European Council, has just returned from Japan.
It was a tiring trip, so I shall make no further preliminary remarks.
- President-in-Office of the Council, I would like, without further ado, to invite you to take the floor before the European Parliament.
<D>
in writing. - (DE) Only 12 years ago, a new technology, which is apparently associated with high death rates and considerable suffering, stunned the world with the cloning of Dolly the sheep.
The commercial sector is already rubbing its hands, dreaming of 'healthy' cloned pork enriched with Omega 3 fatty acids.
They claim that this cruelty to animals also benefits the pigs, which are supposedly healthier thanks to cloning.
Of course, the breeders benefit too, because their financial losses are reduced.
The whole thing is disturbingly like the many and varied temptations to genetic technology, by which multitudes of farmers have been brought to ruin, because the seed was not re-useable and they could not afford any more.
It is also reminiscent of the sudden, unnatural death of entire herds after the animals had eaten genetically modified feedstuffs.
The long-term consequences of radioactive radiation and genetic technology have not yet been ascertained in sufficient detail, and it is impossible to estimate the effects of cloning, let alone cross-breeds.
What would happen if a cloned animal is fed genetic feedstuff?
What effects would that have on humans?
Frankenstein is lurking at the door!
That is why I am voting 'no' this time.
<D>
(CS) I am convinced that the question we must ask today is no longer whether to recognise Kosovo or not: the question is how to maintain political stability and security in a region dominated by ethnic hatred and fear and 40% unemployment.
Paradoxically, Kosovo's independence comes at a time when European countries are moving towards political federalisation.
The situation in the Balkans, however, clearly demonstrates that EU policy offers no solution that would prevent the division of the state while providing for the peaceful coexistence of all the ethnic and religious entities within it.
In this regard, naming this year the Year of Intercultural Dialogue sounds almost like a mockery.
Ladies and gentlemen, some years ago the United States and the European Union both declared that they would not recognise the independence of Kosovo.
Now not only the United States but also many EU countries have done so.
It is quite clear, therefore, that the process of redefining national entities exists and will continue to exist, that there is no global solution to it and that it damages or destroys relations with the original country.
In such a situation we can have only one goal and that is to prevent bloodshed.
<D>
Mr President, like my previous colleague who spoke earlier, I would like to say that I also have my reservations about Mr Barroso being re-elected as President of the Commission.
After all, he more than anyone is committed to further European integration, often against the will of the peoples of Europe.
But he did come to our group meeting, the ECR Group meeting, and explain that he was in favour of smart regulation.
Now, of course, there is much doubt about what 'smart regulation' means.
Many people believe that smart regulation is bad regulation, or that any regulation is not very smart regulation.
But I would ask him, if he really is in favour of smart regulation, to make sure that, on every directive, the Commission carries out a proper economic impact assessment.
We have going through this House next year the Alternative Investment Fund Management Directive.
The Commission has failed so far to conduct any proper economic impact assessment - in fact they say it cannot be done.
How, under those circumstances, are we going to get smart regulation?
I ask Mr Barroso to reconsider.
<D>
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (EL) Mr President, representatives of the Commission and the Council, you have neither said enough to us nor have you convinced for the European Parliament.
The USA's choice to sign separate agreements on an issue of Community jurisdiction is an insult to the EU and should be described as such.
The decision by the Czech Republic to sign such an agreement is an infringement of Community jurisdiction.
Nobody has the right to give personal data on European citizens to the Americans, or to anyone else, without verification by the EU and the European Parliament.
This goes beyond the contents of the PNR.
Members of the Council, I ask you therefore to note that not merely the new Member States are involved.
Although Greece was one of the first 15 Member States of the EU, Greek citizens still need a visa to travel to the USA.
We must stop this, but by means of a single approach not infringing the personal data protection of citizens.
Please include this in your final position.
<D>
(SV) Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his important report.
I am convinced that the best way to counter the crisis is with more free trade and globalisation, not with protectionism.
Europe must therefore keep its markets open in order to combat the recession, stimulate growth, both in Europe and worldwide and, in so doing, combat poverty.
In a few days' time, the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly will meet in Tenerife.
My colleagues from the ACP countries always tend to point out the problems that the EU's subsidised agricultural products create on their markets.
They need trade, but our policy counteracts the establishment of healthy markets for agricultural products in developing countries.
The EU has shown leadership says the Commissioner, but we can do much better.
It is a matter of fair trade, Commissioner.
<D>
Mr President, Commissioner, one year after the brutal crushing of the protests by Buddhist monks, the international community remains divided on the issue of how to act towards one of the most repressive regimes on earth.
The United States and Europe are imposing stricter sanctions and loudly proclaiming their outrage at violations of human rights, as indeed we are doing today in this Chamber.
On the other hand, Burma's neighbours in the region, namely the ASEAN countries, along with China, India and Russia are refraining from open criticism of the Burmese regime on the pretext of not interfering in that country's internal affairs.
That is why I wish to endorse what Mr Matsakis said earlier.
The European Commission should be bolder and raise this question more openly in discussions with China, Russia and the ASEAN countries.
A further difficulty relates to action at the level of the United Nations, which has proved totally ineffective.
Prior to the last General Assembly, a breakthrough on Burma was forecast.
No such breakthrough has taken place.
The European Commission and the Member States should take determined action to ensure that more is done at international level on the issue of Burma.
<D>
rapporteur. - Mr President, I should like to thank my colleagues, and Commissioner Dimas, very much for their comments.
One important point I would like to make is that great care has been taken in our amendments not to reinvent the wheel.
I have learnt from meetings with numerous industry representatives and other stakeholders that many countries, and also many companies, already have in place excellent systems which would fulfil most, if not all, requirements of the due-diligence system.
It makes sense, then, that all the work that has gone into establishing those systems does not go to waste and that we do not create unnecessary extra administrative burdens; that is far from being our intention.
That being so, we have been very careful and have made use of good advice on including wording which would enable good existing systems to qualify under the regulation without the need to establish whole new structures.
So we have taken very seriously the message that we should not be disproportionate, that we should not be putting too much burden on the different players in the trading system, and that is exactly what our report aims to do: to make sure that all players in the trading system have a responsibility, that we do not put everything onto those who first put the products onto the market.
That is what seems disproportionate.
I think it is much more sensible that everybody has a role to play.
I would also add that many elements of our proposals are actually supported by industry.
It is rather ironic that in many senses industry seems to be far more ambitious in this area than even the Commission itself.
I have heard directly from industry how much they appreciate not only the fact that the Committee on the Environment's report provides them with much greater clarity on what will be expected of them, but also precisely this fairer and more effective sharing of responsibility across the different parts of the supply chain which I have just described.
As far as European operators are concerned, I would like to say very clearly that the regulation as we have amended it should do nothing but benefit responsible European operators, since the vast majority of them already do most of what is being asked, and the existence of the regulation will prevent them from being undercut by other, less scrupulous, operators.
So we should be very clear that there is nothing in this report that makes life difficult for European operators.
We have also got some special measures for smaller operators, so we have taken very seriously the risk of being disproportionate; I think we have addressed that very sensibly in the report that we have put before you.
Having heard again your comments, Commissioner, on the Environment Committee's report, I am afraid I do maintain my view that the Commission's proposal as it stands is disappointing and weak and simply will not do what it claims to do.
I fail to see how you can have legislation aimed at preventing the sale of illegally logged timber which does not actually make doing so an offence.
The way in which the whole Commission proposal is written is very patchy and it is very timid.
I think most European consumers would be genuinely shocked to realise that the EU does not already have in place legislation against illegal logging, and I suspect that all those who concluded, in response to the Commission's own consultation, that legislation was the only way to really address the problem would not see the particular proposals by the Commission, the due-diligence system on its own, as sufficient to be able to address the problems that we face.
I will end my comments tonight by seeking - maybe via your good offices, Commissioner - to put some pressure behind the Council to speed up their work, because we really do want to make sure we get a common position from the Council before the summer so that we can move swiftly on with this in the autumn.
As I said earlier, we had really hoped to get a first-reading agreement.
Parliament did everything it could to enable that to happen.
It is, frankly, deeply disappointing that the Council has not acted with equivalent seriousness and speed, but I hope I can ask you once again, Commissioner, to do all you can to ensure that the Council does move swiftly on this.
<D>
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (EL) Mr President, Commissioner, today the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission are to decide on the future of one of the most complex common organisations of agricultural markets in Europe.
The European Parliament gave its opinion in good time before the Council's opinion, and this is due to the intensive efforts made by our rapporteur, Mr Castiglione, and all the efforts of the political groups.
Commissioner, I would like to stress certain points which you must take into account in the Council's final decision on reform of the common organisation of the wine market.
Firstly, reform of the wine market cannot be carried out on a linear, bookkeeping model like the model you used in the common organisation of the sugar market, which we were called on, two months ago, to re-examine because it has reached an impasse.
Reform of the wine market cannot be based on the disastrous model of the common organisation for cotton and tobacco, with the transfer of funds to the second pillar, which has resulted in a decline in production of these two products, while the countryside has become depopulated.
The wine market needs a strong budget in the first pillar in order to strengthen the measures directly for the vine-growers, who will be called on to improve quality and to monitor their production, and also to strengthen the policy of promoting all wines, inside and outside Europe, thus boosting their commercial distribution on the markets.
Commissioner, the European Parliament wants a new common organisation of the market which will prioritise an aggressive promotion policy rather than a defensive import policy.
The European Parliament's report will secure aid for vine-growers who apply measures to stabilise supply, upgrade quality and protect the environment.
Market regulation measures are retained and adapted to current needs, such as the distillation of by-products, which operates as a mechanism for improving quality and at the same time regulating the market and supply.
The report proposes a rationalised grubbing-up scheme which does not waste valuable Community funds on reducing the dynamic of the European wine sector, and it fixes aid for wine-growers at the regional average for assistance, without the restriction of the EUR 350 per hectare ceiling.
Commissioner, we take the view that restrictions must be placed on all those measures that create surpluses, disrupt the balance of the market and create distorted and unfair prices at the expense of other wines.
Here, on behalf of the Socialist Group and also personally as Katerina Batzeli, I shall applaud any measure proposed by the Commission that maintains balance on the question of enriching with sugar, because, as has also been said by the Socialist Group, we have contributed to a balanced motion in order to avoid creating transitional problems.
Nevertheless, the new common organisation of the market should enrich and also respect the consumer's wine knowledge and enhance consumer protection through labelling policy.
The Committee on Agriculture has specified, amongst other things, indication of the CO2 percentage in Amendment 166, information relating to public health matters in Amendment 157, and information on the production of wine from hybrid or genetically modified vines, in the zu Baringdorf amendment.
We should reinforce this respect for the consumer with labelling that includes details of the wine-making practices followed.
Commissioner, we wish to signal a new policy on two categories of wine: the category using geographical indications or a designation of origin, and table wines.
These are two different products and both have a place on the international European market, and I do not think we should have dividing lines which have regional impact.
In conclusion, I would like to say that the complexity of the Common Agricultural Policy reform cannot be treated as an impasse or as a failing of the institutional bodies.
It is due, Commissioner, to the cultural dimension of this product, which we should respect in our proposals.
<D>
in writing - (RO) Stabilizing Afghanistan represents a key security policy challenge for the international community and the fight against terrorism.
In the case of failure, the Western countries might become reluctant to engage in future conflict prevention and resolution interventions and in peace-keeping operations.
On the other hand, the Afghans, who today are experiencing a third decade of conflict and whose country has always been an instrument that external actors have used for their own needs, might also benefit from lasting peace.
Military operations are necessary, but they are not a sufficient requirement to stabilize Afghanistan.
An important solution in this process should also be searched for at a diplomatic level and cooperation with Iran, India and Pakistan is essential, especially in border regions where insurgent groups activate.
For this purpose, strengthening democratic structures is extremely important and the international community should fight against the marginalization of the Afghan government by increasing the importance of the political system and democratic actors at local and regional level.
In Afghanistan, the European Union has the image of a humanitarian organization but, in order to play a more important role, Europeans should take into consideration the fact that the solution to poverty and instability is not in guns and violence, but rather in actions that would bring wellbeing to the Afghan population.
With this hope, I voted for Mr. Brie's report.
<D>
Mr President, the Irish 'no' vote indicates that an unprecedented and successful experiment in world politics, the EU, is in difficulty.
But, in order to be truly indicative of the will of the people, any referendum should be preceded by a campaign of information.
In the Irish case we can measure that by the degree of correspondence, or total lack of it, between the Lisbon Treaty and the arguments invoked against it.
Of course democracy compels us to take the Irish result into account, which we do.
But, equally, democracy cannot be exercised at the expense of the rights of the others, namely those who have already ratified the Lisbon Treaty, and, most important, it cannot be abused to blackmail the majority by a minority.
I am afraid that the Irish 'no' will encourage rather than discourage existing tendencies to renationalise some common policies by prolonging the juridical vacuum the EU finds itself in since the rejection of the constitutional treaty.
I would conclude by saying that, as an MEP from a former Communist country which made great efforts to be admitted to the Union, I would hate to see communism living longer than the European Union.
<D>
(PL) Madam President, a customer who pays an agreed price has fulfilled an obligation.
Russia is responsible for the crisis, and should be subjected to sanctions, Commissioner.
Ukraine is clearly in the middle.
If Russia cannot accept Ukraine's political direction, it will have to get over it, as it got over the loss of political influence over the countries of the Soviet bloc.
The world is changing, and it simply needs to accept this fact.
Russia's theatrical performance in shutting off the gas seemed to show that it did not care about selling us its product.
At least that was how it looked.
I believe that for the good of its economy and of its people, Russia should pay attention to the market and to its image as a trustworthy partner.
The two parties' dependence on one another, I stress, is probably the most important aspect of this contract and of cooperation.
I believe that the Russians will ultimately discover this truth, and Europe will consider Russia and become a good mediator.
<D>
in writing. - (EL) The Commission's proposal to set a production target of 20% of total energy from renewable sources, which must be achieved by each Member State and must be included in national action plans, would have been acceptable were it aiming to meet people's needs, reduce energy dependency, save energy, protect the environment and confirm that energy products are a public asset and not a commodity.
The EU guidelines, however, are aimed at profitability for investors and using renewable energy to pave the way for private capital, while guaranteeing the profitability of renewable energy.
Although renewable sources of energy are natural and inexhaustible, and they contribute to reducing the use of pollutants, the environment continues to be ruined in the name of profit.
An example is the uncontrolled promotion of wind farms for private profit, even in areas protected by NATURA.
As a result, the environment is a hypocritical pretext concealing the liberalisation of the energy sector and its effects on the people's interests.
Energy is being dealt with as a commodity rather than as a common asset.
As for biofuels, it is a provocation to use food products for energy and not to feed the hungry when millions of people are starving to death.
<D>
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Madam President, when it comes to discussing CO2 emissions, we are very quick to talk about cars, simply because the way to a person's guilty conscience is through their car.
That is why Mrs Harms, the Greens and many environmental organisations are particularly keen to talk about cars.
We are faced with a broken voluntary pledge - no doubt about that - and we therefore need regulation.
We have no alternative.
What you came here and told us, Mrs Harms, about the voluntary commitment being deliberately and strategically torpedoed by the car industry seems rather far-fetched to me.
Let me just remind you that a market comprises not only suppliers of products but also those who demand them.
We ourselves help to create demand too, and shortly, when we are driven home by the car service, we shall be using those very cars that do not meet the targets to which the car makers committed themselves.
I should like to see an initiative from the Greens.
If your intentions are honourable, please now make sure that the small cars which meet next year's voluntary target are ordered for Parliament.
In future legislation, it is imperative for us to ensure that the desired reductions stand up to cost-benefit analysis.
The Stern report which you and the Greens like to quote, Mrs Harms, calculates that, of 13 potential CO2-reduction measures, those targeting cars at the very top of the price range are actually the least effective.
Anyone making political demands for stringent emission limits and more efficient cars must recognise that the development and production cycle in the car industry takes five to seven years.
It is by failing to recognise that, Mrs Harms, that we put jobs at risk, not by recognising it.
I am therefore pleased that our rapporteur has done just this by saying that it is unrealistic to set any deadline before 2015.
Tomorrow Parliament will vote in favour of one of the options on the table, and it must be said that, whatever it is, whatever year is designated and whatever average value is set, it will still be more stringent and ambitious than any other regime in the world.
We should not lose sight of that.
There is an extremely fine line between carrot and stick for our car industry, and at the end of the day we must take great care to ensure that we really do export the best products and not perhaps our industry.
<D>
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. - (DE) Mr President, without transparency, there can be no European democracy.
Brussels already has a reputation for allowing the major corporations to call the shots and pull the strings.
That is dangerous for the European project, and it is an issue which is of great concern to me on a personal level and to the Greens as a whole.
As the European Parliament, we therefore have a responsibility to show our hand to voters in the run-up to the next European elections.
We have a good report in front of us, but there are dark forces at work and they want to suppress two of its core elements.
Firstly, they want to prevent financial transparency.
Without financial transparency, we can never be sure who is really behind the campaigns.
I am astonished to find that it is actually the Socialist Group which is opposed to financial transparency and is thus undermining one of these core elements.
As for the second core element which is being undermined, there are people in Parliament who assume that lawyers should not be regarded as lobbyists, even if they are not defending people in court, but instead are trying to pull strings to influence legislation in Europe.
Let me quote from the website of a law firm in Brussels.
It says that because we are not currently regarded as lobbyists under this legislation,
'Therefore lobbying by lawyers will be more and more effective and goals are more likely to be achieved with legal support.
Alber & Geiger as a law firm exclusively specialised on lobbying and government relations will be at your side to assist you in reaching your goals within the EU.'
(DE) As you see, even the law firms themselves are admitting that they are lobbyists.
Ladies and gentlemen, that is unacceptable.
If we allow that to happen, we will undermine our own credibility.
<D>
(PL) Mr President, in international law there is a Latin principle that goes like this: 'par in parem non habet imperium'.
This means that a state cannot judge another state or impose sanctions on it, but that is in the past, that is history.
International society, guided by common sense and rationalism, has completed an enormous about-turn.
The primitive sanctions that states used to use against each other according to the retaliation principle, following the Biblical principle, drawn from the Old Testament, of 'an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth', has been replaced by the excellent mechanism of collective, organised sanctions whereby procedures decide on who may use this mechanism, when and how.
I am glad that the European Union is working out an ever more refined mechanism for applying sanctions, which includes differentiation to take account of the situation and the level of blame.
There are two things I should like to emphasise.
I am in favour of wise and intelligent sanctions that are sensibly applied, but I am against what are called preventive sanctions.
In my view, preventive sanctions are an abuse.
Secondly, I would like to appeal for us to give greater attention to society, to our citizens, by informing them that sanctions are not a primitive punishment, but a natural, healthy reaction to a serious violation of the law, and that they serve to defend democracy.
<D>
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report we are discussing today relates to some very important issues of harmonising the terms of marketing authorisations for medicinal products.
As draftsman of the opinion of the European Parliament's Committee on Agriculture, I would like to express my support for the Commission's proposal.
To date, only a small proportion of medicinal products falls within the remit of European legislation.
Products that have received only national marketing authorisation are not subject to current European legislation on variations, and are therefore subject to various specific national laws.
On the one hand, this is inefficient and costly to the economy while, on the other, it prevents the internal market from functioning smoothly.
Implementing the present directive would provide a legal basis for harmonisation and would bring great benefits to consumers and to the sector.
It would also enable faster access to the latest medicinal products in all Member States.
The lack of harmonised regulations means that each country applies its own specific national rules.
This situation gives rise to red tape, barriers and difficulties in the operation of the internal market while resulting in differing safety criteria.
Special attention should be paid to the cost to the Member States of implementing the new legislation.
I do not believe that the countries of Europe will be able to amend their internal legislation within the short timescales provided to accommodate the additional changes, and which will entail high costs.
My congratulations to the rapporteur and I ask you to vote in favour of Mrs Grossetête's report.
<D>
in writing. - (PT) This report considers aspects beyond traditional trade in raw materials and commodities.
In the new international situation various production factors and components may be regarded as raw materials, including energy.
The increase in the prices of those products is serious for European industry, which imports them from outside its borders.
The markets respond to the increase in demand on the part of more producers facing natural and environmental condition and react to financial speculation.
It is worrying that this international situation has encouraged price levels capable of wiping out economic growth in Europe.
Once that trend is established, the race for resources will give rise to pressure and shortages which are likely to pose a challenge to many generations of managers and will certainly have implications for the governance of the modern world.
By means of this report the European Parliament calls on the Commission to raise within the WTO issues of access to raw material markets.
The objective is to obtain reciprocity and one appropriate route is via the WTO.
Negotiations on these products should never go below regional level so as to promote integration, development and sustainability.
In order to prevent major speculation and conflict, we must ensure that our trading partners holding these resources receive a fair price for their commodities.
<D>
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a regulation in question was examined in depth by the Committee on Legal Affairs, for which I have the honour of being the draftsman.
The suggestions put forward in the opinion approved unanimously by that committee met with only partial approval, however, within the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs.
Nonetheless, I have to say that together we have tried to rationalise the Council's initial proposal as far as possible, adding elements of legal certainty.
The compromise amendments approved by the two committees with the help of Mrs Gebhardt, whom I would like to thank, have been welcomed and have bolstered the principles we referred to with the aim of getting this regulation off the ground.
In this regard, the authorities of a state which makes no provision for divorce and which does not recognise the type of marriage in question will not be obliged to dissolve that marriage.
On one point, however, there remains a difference of opinion - that mentioned earlier by Mrs Gebhardt.
The basic issue is this: the choice of law is entirely new in the legal world, since it is not normally possible to choose the law, only to choose a judge, making this a completely new concept.
Given this choice of law, to which law do we want to refer?
To the law of one of the 27 states of the European Union, or to the law of any country in the world?
It is true that there is a limit.
The limit is that already established by public policy and the non-applicability in a given state of any law providing for a type of marriage not considered to exist in that state.
I believe that if we really want legal certainty - my objection is a technical one - if we really want to introduce 'shopping around' with regard to the choice of applicable law, if we really want to abide by the weakest code of law - because let us not forget that to choose a law you need consensus and that consensus can also be subject to considerable pressure - if we really want to construct a European legal area then, in my opinion, it is a good thing for all of these amendments that the choice of law be limited to the laws of the 27 states of the European Union.
In this sense, though we have tabled several amendments, they are in essence one and the same, and since it is a technical amendment that does not alter our overall opinion of the proposal, we appeal to the common sense of all Members in order that this amendment be approved.
<D>
rapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the representatives of the European Parliament speak a variety of languages and we belong to different groups, but we are united in the same desire, to move the European Union forward by completing the Lisbon Treaty, a treaty that includes legislative codecision, the unique personality of the Union, progress in the communitarisation of internal and justice policy and external policy, and participation by national parliaments.
We want greater democracy and greater efficiency.
We regret the fact that there is not more transparency, but this is part of the methods of the Intergovernmental Conference.
I have to say that the lawyers - particularly those from Parliament - have enabled us to interpret the hieroglyphics that this exercise has become in a positive way.
I would like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council to confirm to Parliament something that I understand to be a very clear commitment.
The citizens, who were very unfairly relegated to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, have returned to the Treaty on European Union with the wording that it had had since the Maastricht Treaty.
We see this as fundamental, as representatives of the citizens.
I must acknowledge that, in an unusual gesture of political clarity, the President-in-Office of the Council himself told us that this was impossible, but it has been achieved: the first important achievement.
The second one is the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is the symbol of the identity of European citizens.
Now it is not a declaration - number 11; neither is it a protocol: it is 'the Charter', which we will vote on here next month, formally, with the Presidents of the three Community institutions, before starting the ratification process.
The Charter will be legally binding, and I say this because I believe that it is important for it to be recorded today, because I think that these are absolutely essential conditions for the European Parliament, sine qua non conditions for supporting this treaty.
There are also other elements on which we think progress can be made.
My fellow Member Elmar Brok mentioned the subject of data protection, which is a sensitive subject if ever there was one.
There are some other elements that are very important for us.
One of them is the dialogue between the social partners - which was unfairly relegated to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union - and another important matter that we believe we are helping with through our support for resolution of confidence problems is to provide security through a declaration, like the Ioannina Compromise, which already exists, but should not go any further.
We do not think it makes any sense in a Treaty on a Union that functions by majority, and qualified majority, to introduce elements of unanimity that would absolutely destroy the process.
I mentioned in Viana do Castelo, as the President will recall, that it makes sense having the atomic bomb if it is not used.
If it is used, it destroys everything.
And I think that this is an important warning.
Mr President, there is a point that is important to Parliament, and I think that I am speaking on behalf of the majority of Parliament, and the majority of the Member States, and very clearly on behalf of those that ratified the Constitutional Treaty, which we sacrificed in order to achieve unanimity, and on this occasion it is very important for us all to work together in mutual loyalty and solidarity in order to achieve ratification.
If not, we would find ourselves in very difficult circumstances.
I think that we all need to remain faithful to the commitment that we have made.
Thank you very much, Mr President.
<D>
As coordinator of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, I should like to give an explanation of vote on my own behalf and that of my group colleagues.
All groups are united in the fight against racism and against every form of ethnic discrimination, and in promoting human rights.
There is no question but that the PPE-DE Group shares the desire to see light shed on the events in Italy.
In the resolution, we refer mainly to press reports and to documents and testimonies from a range of organisations and individuals.
Most Members were unable to form an idea of the situation using their own resources.
The Italian authorities have invited representatives of Parliament to travel to Italy to find out more, and have also offered to provide further information.
The Commissioner responsible, Jacques Barrot, has promised to present an informative report by the end of July, and our group was keen to wait for this.
Our aim was, and still is, to clarify the facts properly first of all.
That is why we wanted to postpone voting on the resolution until the September part-session.
Unfortunately, our motion was rejected, along with a series of amendments that had been tabled, which is why we voted as we did.
The PPE-DE Group continues to hold the view that a thorough investigation would have been more worthwhile than this resolution, which was adopted in haste.
Our opponents were aiming only to hit the headlines and did the people concerned a disservice in the process.
<D>
Madam President, I want to start by thanking the various rapporteurs for their work, particularly Mrs Krehl and Mr van Nistelrooij.
They enabled a broad consensus to be achieved within our committee.
We must also welcome the European Commission's Green Paper on Territorial Cohesion, which puts some important issues on the table.
Firstly, cohesion policy is important as an instrument for ensuring the balanced development of the European Union, with any attempt to re-nationalise these policies being rejected.
The new concept of territorial cohesion is included, which is why a consultation process was started - which is now about to end - that must be taken into account.
It has been adapted to the new challenges, such as the effects of globalisation, climate change and demographic changes.
The figures from the latest cohesion report show us that, although the differences between regions are diminishing, thus fulfilling the principle of convergence, we must now tackle another issue, which is the persistence of intraregional differences.
As a result, when determining the eligibility criteria for funding, we must consider the possibility of taking certain aspects into account other than purely per capita income.
In addition, with regard to including the 'territorial' concept, we must be aware of the need to take account of the specific features of certain regions, such as their geographical disadvantages, their outermost position or the depopulation processes in certain regions.
Cohesion is one of the most obvious successes of the European project.
Spain has been a clear example of this, given the economic and social development that it has experienced.
This is the path along which we must continue in order to guarantee equal opportunities for all Europeans, regardless of where they live.
The European Union is made up of a wide range of regions, with differences that enrich them and give meaning to this project.
However, if we have to insist on something with regard to cohesion policy, it must be on the need to give our regions all the tools to ensure that they have equal opportunities to access development and growth.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in my opinion, much of what has been said is true, but much is also false.
There are three things we must hold to.
Firstly, randomly selecting groups of people in order to collect personal information about them is unlawful, both generally and under the Italian Constitution.
Secondly, this means that protective measures taken for children, such as Roma children, must be taken within the framework of the legislation in force in the European Union and in Italy.
Thirdly, Italy's Minister for Foreign Affairs Franco Frattini phoned me an hour ago to tell me that he wants to indicate - at least to my group - that Minister for the Interior Roberto Maroni has met Commissioner Barrot in Cannes.
I know that a meeting with Mr Deprez, the Chair of the competent committee, also took place there.
By means of Mr Frattini's phone call and of statements by Mr Maroni, the Italian Government has signified that it does not want to take any legislative measures that contravene European legal standards in any way.
Commissioner Špidla, I assume, therefore, that you will make contact with Commissioner Barrot when he returns from Cannes, and I would ask you please to report to Parliament immediately afterwards, because the Italian Government has apparently understood that the initiatives it has taken so far are not compatible with European law.
If it is now drawing the correct conclusions from that, I find this a very welcome development.
(Applause)
<D>
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to add my voice to those who wish to congratulate the rapporteur and thank him for his report.
Like him, I also support the opinion that the compilation of good quality and comparable job vacancy statistics is a European priority.
I am equally certain that collecting this statistical data under the auspices of a gentlemen's agreement alone is insufficient, and that it is necessary to adopt a legal act at European level to guarantee the production of harmonised and high-quality statistics across the Member States.
Only the Commission can coordinate the necessary harmonisation of statistical information at Community level.
I did advocate the same point of view recently, when expressing my opinion on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on Community statistics on public health and health and safety at work.
I was also very pleased by the results of the trialogue between the rapporteur, the Commission and the presidency.
The ensuing compromise proposals significantly enhanced the quality of the document.
Just like the shadow rapporteurs from the other political groups, I, too, was happy to add my signature on behalf of the GUE/NGL.
Among these compromise proposals I would like to highlight in particular the significant contribution of the proposal to include in the statistics data concerning units with fewer than 10 employees, the proposal to distinguish between vacancies for fixed-term and permanent posts, and the proposal to ensure that as many European citizens as possible have access to the data.
Finally, I would like to say that I welcome the definition of the quality assessment criteria because only relevant, exact, updated and comprehensible job vacancy data can help to fight unemployment in the Community.
<D>
(HU) Madam President, President of the Commission, President of the European Council, the agreement reached at the European Summit was the first major political success of the current Hungarian Presidency.
It is primarily a conservative success.
Its implementation depends on unity.
For this reason it is regrettable and requires explanation that four countries with conservative governments did not accept the Euro Plus Pact.
It is regrettable and turncoat behaviour to recommend something to others that we, as the Presidency, do not consider acceptable for ourselves.
Whoever stays out misses out.
A country which does not aim for a breakthrough based on knowledge and competitiveness but for cheap wages and winning the tax competition will be the poorhouse of the European Union even in the medium term.
As I have mentioned tax competition, Commission President, President of the Council, how do you explain that the Council did not discuss the issue of tax havens?
Do you think that this is not a problem for European citizens?
You are mistaken!
We expect much more progress from the Council and the Commission.
Permit me to also address the Japanese natural disaster and the consequent industrial disaster.
There are 12 000 dead, 17 000 missing, hundreds of thousands are homeless and millions are without work.
The European Union, which considers solidarity an asset, must help.
The disaster shook the world's energy and raw materials markets.
It will determine the political and economic environment for a long time.
It is imperative that we improve the world's nuclear safety.
It is imperative that we devise rules that make this possible.
It is imperative that we boost research and development investments and strengthen diversification in European energy policy.
These objectives, Commission President and President of the Council, have already been formulated in the 2020 objectives.
It is the Council's and the Commission's job to build the road leading here and generate the resources for this.
We wish you every success in this.
<D>
Firstly, I would like to answer Mr Goebbels's question about why the European Central Bank allocated more money than the US Central Bank.
It is because the EU economy is now the largest in the world.
This is a great challenge for us all.
The fact that the OECD and the European Commission assessed the potential outcomes of the financial problems in the market differently on the same day surprised and saddened me.
This means that the European Commission should probably adjust its economic assessment models, especially since they are likely to be based on mathematical methods.
It is worrying, as forecasting economic policy is a complicated matter and the instruments used must be flexible.
What should we do now when we meet new challenges?
I would not like to comment here on the problems that arise; my fellow members have done this so well.
I would just like to emphasise one point.
Firstly, the crisis occurred because of the aggressive monetary policy within the EU's boundaries when it was attempted to solve the problems of the Internet bubble.
Thus we cannot influence various decisions of third countries.
We can strengthen the dialogue and cooperation with supervisory bodies, but the European Union faces a dilemma: a global merger of financial institutions is currently taking place and it is possible that we will no longer have a single market.
We will have a transatlantic market in the area of securities; perhaps we will have some other market in the area of insurance.
This means that we need to decide whether we consider Europe to be a single market and require all agreements to be made at European level.
Can we accept pilot projects when one of our markets enters the world stage independently?
We need agreement on this, otherwise it will be very difficult to manage this crisis.
I would like to emphasise one more thing.
Financial markets are under reconstruction.
We ourselves acknowledged the role of non-banking institutions in the SEPA Directive.
We need to admit that various Islamic banks and foundations are appearing and finally that trading networks are entering the financial market.
Thus the regulation of non-banking institutions is also necessary - common regulation, which would make the rules of the game the same for both banking and non-banking institutions.
This is today's reality.
The third issue that I would like to emphasise is that I am worried that we use only risky models as a basis.
This principle of risk assessment has proved to be very subjective, and I therefore have doubts about the Solvency II and Basel II directives.
We cannot trust rating agencies; we can criticise them, but the problem will remain.
We should trust market instruments - that is, liquidity.
If we cannot sell particular securities on the market or if they are rarely traded, no rating agency can evaluate them.
This should be properly understood and we need to reduce the dependence of our legislation on the opinions of rating agencies.
To conclude, I would certainly like to say that there is no need to rescue financial institutions.
I can say from my own experience after the financial crisis in Lithuania that when bankers spend a couple of weeks in prison they very quickly understand how to manage banks.
(The President cut off the speaker)
<D>
Mr President, the proposal for a Council regulation concerning a multi-annual recovery plan for bluefin tuna in the Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean puts into practice the binding decision adopted by consensus by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) at its annual meeting held in November 2008.
As has been stated, this regulation should enter into force before the start of the fishing season in April, which means that this mandatory consultation of the European Parliament must be carried out during this plenary session.
We would like to help achieve an effective political agreement within the Council on this subject which, in our view, is extremely important and deserves our closest attention.
That is why Parliament's Committee on Fisheries came out unanimously in favour of the urgent procedure.
The aim of the annual fishing plans, the reduction in the fishing season, the strengthening of the monitoring system, the spawning grounds in the Mediterranean and the presence of ICCAT observers in the purse seine fishery and on tuna farms, all measures included in the regulation, is to ensure compliance with the management measures adopted and to ensure traceability at all stages.
I think they will be successful.
Each contracting party - I think it is important to point this out - will have to submit a fishing plan for the fishing boats and pound nets that catch bluefin tuna in the Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean which identifies, inter alia, the authorised fishing vessels over 24 metres and the measures introduced to ensure that individual quotas are not exceeded.
Another of the important measures to be adopted is the reduction in the fishing season and the extension of the closed seasons for purse seiners, long-liners, live bait and trolling boats, pelagic trawlers and recreational fishing.
The adjustment plans for countries with excess fleet capacity and bluefin tuna fattening farms are also important.
Ladies and gentlemen, I have read a considerable amount about tuna in recent days, and I would like to raise a few issues here in the short time I have left.
Adding to the almost non-existent governance to counter the concurrent interests of fishing nations and high market demand, numerous factors of various kinds combine to leave the bluefin, a highly exploited species nowadays, in such a precarious situation.
The fact is that the European Union, or rather three Member States (France, Spain and Italy), together account for half of the world's landings of bluefin tuna.
It is therefore crucial that the European Union should be able to supply ICCAT with statistics that are of the same quality as the fishing or the fishing effort expended, not least because statistics are essential if we want to carry out research to answer the needs or questions being raised today by bluefin biology and ecology, which present scientific research with a real challenge.
If we want to save this species, we have to learn more about it.
In my view, therefore, anything connected with data collection and statistics is especially important.
<D>
(ES) Madam President, Commissioners, the recent situation concerning Russia and Ukraine and the gas supply has clearly shown that more than ever before we need to diversify our supply and improve connections between Member States and with producer countries.
The Commission's proposals are heading in this direction, but in the interests of greater efficacy these proposals should also include, and I was glad to hear the Commissioner mention it today, the potential in the south of our continent and in particular in my country, Spain.
Spain is the Member State with the greatest diversification of supply, both in terms of the number of countries - our gas is imported from 10 different countries - as well as in the range of formats.
For this reason, my country is an excellent supply platform for the European Union.
The supply is achieved both through the gas pipeline from Algeria as well as by liquefied natural gas in similar volumes to that of Nabucco, but at a lower cost and with better delivery times.
However this platform cannot currently be used by the European Union due to the lack of a connection to France.
Medgas, Mr Piebalgs, must be a priority for the European Union, as must the specific problems of our island territories.
If the Iberian peninsular clearly suffers from isolation in energy terms, islands such as the Balearic Islands, where I am from, suffer a double isolation.
This is very unfair for the inhabitants of these islands because we, as Europeans, have equal rights.
I sincerely request, Mr Piebalgs, that you consider the particular situation of island territories when taking decisions and establishing priorities.
Finally, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her work.
<D>
- (PL) Mr President, Commissioner, the fact that elections are observed by recognised institutions improves the election atmosphere and sometimes even helps to crystallise significant changes, as happened, for example, during the Orange Revolution in Kiev.
Observation is obviously a costly undertaking, but one that is justified, since on the one hand it teaches democracy, and on the other hand it helps us to appreciate the political awareness and soul of a given nation.
I have a few suggestions on how missions can be made effective without undue cost.
Firstly, we should send people who know the local language.
If this is not feasible, the group of observers could be put together in such a way that a single language (French or English) is used, into which translations are made, and which in turn means taking along interpreters to translate into that particular language.
As far as possible, it would be worth recruiting volunteers from other countries, such as students or members of non-governmental and student organisations.
Why?
The more observers there are, the better things will go.
Even though we sometimes hear ironic comments, in Africa for example, that they do not need any more colonists, it turns out that contact and interaction with electors leads to their recognition of the mission and, at the same time, of that form of democratic support.
Where human rights are concerned, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats are for our part taking steps to ensure that people living in particularly vulnerable areas of the globe are aware of their rights and are able to fight for them.
Constant education is needed for this.
There is no other way out.
I shall finish by saying that without fundamental human values and rights, democracy may be a defective solution, if not a caricature of how to govern.
<D>
- (FR) Madam President, the European textile and clothing sector is a sector that has been hard hit over the last few years by the damaging effects of globalisation.
Today, in spite of some still painful wounds in certain European regions, this sector has been able to change direction, not least through the development of technical and innovative textiles.
However, let us not undermine this industry's capacity for recovery by being lax and negligent.
Indeed the European Union must maintain the political will to create a consistent competitive framework for its businesses, by remaining vigilant and by taking practical and effective action when this proves necessary.
For the Union to do this, Commissioner, you must continue to monitor the customs statistics of imports arriving from China and you must keep this sector informed of the most recent developments.
We must keep a close eye on matters and we must be responsive.
The European Union has the means to do this: the trade protection instruments are a perfect example of such means.
Therefore, I will continue to hammer home the point that a Europe that protects is not a protectionist Europe.
However, my concern today, Commissioner, is based on the unprecedented increase in seizures of counterfeit textile and leather articles, articles that are impregnated with azo dyes or nickel, which put the security and the health of European consumers increasingly at risk.
This is a phenomenon that, as you can well imagine, is not about to go away with the economic crisis that we are going through.
That is why I call on you to work with the Member States to implement as quickly as possible the four-year action plan on combating counterfeiting and piracy, with the creation of a European counterfeiting observatory and the strengthening of the European customs system.
Making it mandatory to indicate the origin of goods sourced from third countries, harmonising the customs control procedures, and punishing violations of intellectual property rights by criminal prosecution are the battles that we have to fight on behalf of our businesses, our jobs and the citizens of Europe.

on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, as the original rapporteur on Regulation No 1049/2001 I find this a very interesting debate.
What I find strange - since I know the participants in the debate here tonight are committed fully to openness and transparency - is that the argument as to why not enough has been done is 'we need more time'.
This is unacceptable.
Only 30% of the European population have faith in the European Union.
Why?
Because they feel absolutely disconnected from what is done in their name.
And the amazing thing is that we have a positive story to tell.
Why is it that the institution has to be dragged screaming and kicking to the European Courts in order to do the right thing?
We need to do more than just explain.
Commissioner Wallström, I know you are as exasperated and exhausted by these arguments as I am, but it is not enough to say we need more time.
We actually need to demonstrate to our citizens that we will not only explain to them why we do what we do, but how we do it and the legal advice upon which we operate.
Because, unless we do that, we will disconnect people from the European project.
It has been argued here tonight that this is impossible with regard to some matters, owing for example the imprecise definition of 'documents'.
It is not imprecise at all.
It is in fact well defined.
It means all documents held, received or produced by the three institutions or the agencies set up by them.
And 'documents' itself is clearly defined.
So let us have the courage to have an open register.
Not the maze that we have at the moment where, when you go into one register, you do not get access to all of the other registers or all of the other links.
At the moment we have citizens who go into a maze.
Let us allow citizens to come into the door of the three institutions and let us expose ourselves to the scrutiny of public opinion.
I tell you now that unless we do the right thing, the judgement will be made in the June election in favour of those extreme parties who are not in favour of the EU or the EU institutions.
Time is running out.
Act now.
It is not impossible.
<D>
(FI) Mr President, this resolution is important and we have our own basic view of it.
This situation is as stormy as the Bermuda Triangle, and dependence, climate problems and prices that the poor just cannot pay are making the sea churn - not to forget the speculators and the price of food.
Saving energy is necessary and the most effective solution; that we know.
The carbon footprint of the poor, however, is tiny compared to the rich, who have no intention of actually reducing it but are ready simply to pay more.
Should we in this situation therefore introduce legislation on energy taxation that is progressive?
Those who can afford to pay would pay relatively more for energy.
Or should we impose a higher price on goods that consume a lot of energy or services that waste it?
The speculators must obviously be brought under control.
We speak of sustainable development: its heroes are the energy-poor and their situation needs to be organised sustainably.
That is our basic view.
<D>
(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, at this stage of the debate most of what can be said on this subject has already been said.
However, I would like to refer to the Commissioner's exhortation about the need to think about the underlying roots of extremism.
It seems to me that the problem of extremism is not that there is a series of groups who carry out violent attacks.
It is a problem, but it has to be tackled through the law and individuals must be prosecuted, etc.
The problem arises when the violence and the intentions behind it are repeated and have a chance to affect a broad sector of the population or certain sectors of the population.
From a social and political point of view, it is when violence causes concern that the problem arises.
As for how to prevent it, I think there are three essential factors.
First, the Commissioner mentioned a knowledge of history - I myself believe that it is very important to know about tragedies, about successes and ultimately about ourselves as humans.
However, I think we have to be careful not to use history as a weapon against others with a view to short-term political gain - something which is happening now in some countries, including my own country, Spain, I have to say.
Secondly, I think there are two other fundamental aspects which at the moment are much underrated.
Firstly, education.
We have lost, and are still losing, or at least eroding, values such as work, discipline, self-reliance, that is to say all those values which go towards creating a good citizen when these people reach adulthood.
Finally, in the context of the European Union, the important thing is not to break up that environment in which we Europeans can challenge together the networks created by globalisation.
What we have now, and what we have had at other times in the course of 20th century European history, is a great deal of uncertainty, a certain desperation, a certain aimlessness, and what we need to do is provide hope, a forward-looking spirit and strong leadership so that everyone feels a part of the European Union.
<D>
We are currently facing an unprecedented crisis.
It has affected not only financial affairs, but also economic and social affairs, and has hit not just several Member States, but the entire European Union and the world.
Leaders of the Party of European Socialists have adopted a joint declaration calling on States 'For an ambitious recovery plan to safeguard employment and prevent mass unemployment'.
The only way to have a real effect on the economy is to give it a budgetary stimulus which is adequate to the problem being faced and is coordinated across the whole of Europe.
Our priority, which guides everything we say or do, is to make jobs secure and to fight unemployment, while also promoting sound ecological development.
If we do not make fresh efforts to combat the crisis in Europe, unemployment will rise to 25 million at the beginning of 2010, and the condition of public finance will worsen considerably.
The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) was established in 2006 and will function until 2013.
The purpose of the EGF is to provide support for workers made redundant as a result of globalisation.
The Fund's maximum annual budget is EUR 500 million and it is used to support active labour market measures, such as assistance for people seeking work, in the form of further training grants and mobility allowances.
I support the idea of a reduction in the number of redundancies (to 500) required to trigger intervention.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, it is to be warmly welcomed that, after five years - the duration of the programme - we can already see an improvement and thus are able to take it a stage further in both substantive and financial terms.
Parliament is not normally so enthusiastic as to adopt a report as early as first reading; but, I believe, the report is so well written and we can support the content so strongly that it is more important to wrap up at this first reading than to block the project.
None of the students would understand why we still needed a second reading.
I think it is very important that we promote intercultural understanding and cooperation with third countries and not, as some of our fellow Members in this House have just noted, fastidiously enumerate figures on what this or that does for us.
Exchange has always brought benefits, and we have always been able to gain from it.
It is a win-win situation.
Looking at this any other way is narrow-minded and a little petty.
It is also important that we improve the promotion of this programme, that we advertise even more in the countries with too little involvement, that we simplify various things.
Agreement on the visa issue is very important and fundamental, as is uniformity across all countries of enrolment fees, for example.
More comparators and more simplification are needed in order to advance the project even further.
The geographical presence of all countries should be as great as possible, of course, to make the project even more successful.
We can indeed be very proud of these five years, and we shall certainly make even greater progress on this in future.
This is in keeping with the subjects of exchange and the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue 2008, which must not be limited to various discussions, but also put into practice.
<D>
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, the rapporteur claims that this initiative will encourage small and medium-sized enterprises to expand their cross-border business.
But I have little doubt that it has been heavily promoted by the large multinationals, because it is they that stand to benefit most.
In my country, in Britain, the vast majority of businesses are small, and they provide for some 70% of employment.
Only a tiny proportion of these have any interest in foreign operations.
But my main objection is that it is more meddling by the European Union in taxation matters.
Judging by the EU's record of value added tax, there will be endless changes to the law.
We have had eight directives on VAT so far, and it is still a mess and prone to fraud.
Businesses operate best when there are simple, well understood rules, as Mr Schmidt has just said.
The EU knows how to do only one thing, and it does it to perfection.
And that is to make things complicated.
So, contrary to the views of other Members, a much better plan would be to encourage tax competition.
Then those nations that have the lightest and simplest taxes will attract the most businesses.
<D>
(EL) Mr President, development under the Lisbon Strategy, guided by the principle of support for competitiveness, i.e. increasing the profitability of the monopoly business groups in the European Union, not only intensifies to the utmost the exploitation of the working class and of workers generally, but also severely aggravates environmental problems, by systematically destroying marine ecosystems and the biodiversity of the seas, and causing a steady deterioration in the quality of sea water.
In addition to the damage caused to sea water by pollution from ships, industrial pollution bears a huge share of the responsibility for the contamination of sea water.
It causes an incalculable level of contamination in the water table, and this is subsequently transferred to sea water.
Pollution from the ever increasing number of fish-farming units also places severe strain on the marine environment and the functioning of ecosystems.
The problems of the marine environment are seriously aggravated by the invasion of monopolies into a number of operations which were previously in public ownership, as a result of the privatisation of utilities and public infrastructures, and also by the commercialisation of public assets such as sea water.
Huge tourist complexes owned by monopoly groups are leading to a high-income model of tourist development, while public assets such as coastlines, beaches and sea water are being despoiled.
The pollution of sea water is no longer solely due to the discharge of waste and sewage from those tourist complexes into the sea, but also to the construction of industrial units to serve their business activities, including the installation of desalination units to irrigate golf courses and generally to serve their needs.
The consequences are dire for the residents of entire areas.
I would like to end, Mr President, by pointing out that the common position of the Council and the Commission report does not actually provide the solution which is needed, if we are to solve or at least mitigate serious problems relating to the environment.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I feel as if some of us always expect some kind of sensation.
In view of the starting point and the issues to be addressed, this was not a normal summit; it was far better than might have been feared for some other summits.
It was a good summit and I welcome the results, but it is true that the citizens want action and the issue of credibility also needs to be addressed.
On the day the summit produced its results, I was asked by a schoolgirl why I had any confidence in these results, given that they were developed and adopted by the very people who are failing to meet the Kyoto targets and implement the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy in full.
That is why I have now taken to emphasising one particular point: the European Union's credibility with the citizens hinges on whether we actually put into practice what we adopt on paper.
What we need now is joint and tangible action within the agreed timeframe, not national squabbling.
Implementing these decisions will require a great deal of hard work.
If we do the job properly, the summit will have strengthened innovation and competitiveness and bolstered growth and employment, and that is the best form of social policy.
We see the social dimension as being an integral part of our policy.
It is judged not only by the number of times the world 'social' appears in the document, Mr Schulz, but how much responsibility and social commitment it contains.
<D>
- (FR) Mr President, the Presidency conclusions from the last Council make for amusing reading.
They resemble a victory statement of routed armies everywhere.
They have the pathetic quality of such statements, up to and including where they repeatedly affirm that, with the crisis coming to an end, the EU will build a stronger economy for the future, and where they reaffirm the Lisbon Strategy, while in fact it is going completely off the rails.
It follows that, as they shut themselves away in their glass towers, Eurocrats, Europhiles and ultra-Europeans of all kinds end up no longer having a grip on matters.
Everyone is well aware that the euro zone was the first to enter into recession because it had the lowest growth rate in the world for eight years.
However, it was also the one that had the greatest difficulties in terms of its competitiveness and employment situation.
Above all, it is the euro zone that, due to the general trend of stripping nations of their natural defences, is the worst equipped to react.
In reality, the only virtue of the crisis is that it will wake up populations lulled by financial expectation facilities and anti-national propaganda.
Only the Member States will have the legitimate instruments needed for any far-reaching action, and they will have to remove the shackles of the EU and the euro if such action is to be achieved.
For the people of France, at least, it is becoming increasingly clear that there will be no safety without France, no France without French policy, and no French policy without national and popular sovereignty.
<D>
(NL) Mr President, we are discussing the last budget under the Treaty of Nice.
Next year, things will be very different: for the first time, Parliament will be able to get its teeth into agricultural policy and fisheries expenditure, for example.
This part of the budget will finally come within the reach of Parliament, and I am looking forward to that, I can tell you.
Anyway, we are now talking about the 2010 budget.
I should like to make a couple of brief remarks.
The additional money for energy and research and also for decommissioning the Kozloduy nuclear power plant in Bulgaria are positive aspects, but what I take issue with are the broad lines of the EU budget.
Will the European contributions really make our economy fit for the future?
The answer is 'no'.
Let us not fool ourselves.
Let us use the forthcoming review of the financial perspective to set our sights on the future.
I call on the Council and the Commission to really take this review seriously, then, rather than regarding it as a bit of a joke.
The current budget is still investing too much in yesterday's economy: there is too much of the old support for agriculture and the regions and far too little investment in what is really important, namely sustainability and innovation.
We are at a turning point.
Do we want to turn Europe into an open-air museum where Americans, Chinese and Indians can experience fine culture and good food, or do we want to make it into a dynamic, progressive region, one that the rest of the world regards with envy?
In other words, do we choose stagnation or progress?
My answer goes without saying.
Let us also take a close look at the financing of the European Union.
We are going to have to move over to a system of own resources no matter what.
In response to a request by our group, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, the Commission will be presenting a proposal on this.
I am looking forward to this.
The current system gives the Union too little elbow room and has the perverse effect of making Member States more interested in how much they can get back than in whether the European contribution is really effective.
I also take the view that we need to do much more to halt the decline in world biodiversity.
<D>
I would like to thank Mr Moraes for raising this important issue.
The European Arrest Warrant has really delivered significant results.
The main change lies in the mutual recognition of judicial decisions, and the dual criminality requirement is no longer in place for 32 serious crimes.
Proceedings therefore take much less time.
Compared with the lengthy extradition procedure, which generally takes more than a year, under the European Arrest Warrant a surrender procedure takes only 43 days on average.
All of this is in fact handled by the courts.
The new procedure is widely used by Member States.
In 2006, 6 752 European Arrest Warrants were issued.
A total of 2 042 people were arrested with the EAW and 1 892 people were effectively surrendered.
More than a fifth of the individuals surrendered in accordance with the EAW procedure were nationals from the executing Member State.
When you think that in 2006 we had practically as many arrest warrants as there were procedures over a 10-year period, it is clear that the European Arrest Warrant has been a success.
The initial constitutional problems of certain Member States have been overcome.
Nevertheless, Mr Moraes, we need to recognise that in terms of the surrender of nationals, we are occasionally seeing old extradition procedures being used which is a sign of the residual lack of confidence in some Member States and in certain criminal justice systems.
However, we think that this will disappear and that the system will be able to function optimally.
Based on an analysis of the transposition of the framework decision into Member States' legislation, the Commission reported in 2005 and 2007 on the functioning of the European Arrest Warrant.
This revealed that certain adjustments had been made in Member States.
Currently, a series of peer reviews are being carried out, in which the Commission is involved as an observer.
These reviews will conclude in early 2009.
It will be at that point, based on the results of the reviews, that the Commission will present a new report identifying the different practices, flaws and issues examined at European Union level in order to further improve how the European Arrest Warrant works, although it seems to me that this still remains one of the main success stories as regards the principle of mutual recognition.
<D>
(RO) I am speaking today to bring to your attention the position of Romanian farmers one year after Romania's accession.
In Romania, agriculture is still inefficient or not efficient enough, and yet it is a vital occupation for most of the population.
Farmers make up a significant proportion of the working population, but there is also a significant number of elderly farmers.
In this context, I welcome the Commission's decision not to activate the safeguard clause in this field; however, this is not enough.
In 2008, European disbursements will amount to 25% of the European average; only in 9 years' time will Romania be able to reach that average.
Over the last few years, Romania has been quick to transpose the acquis in the qualitative, health and phytosanitary fields.
Adjustment costs can be a major obstacle to Romanian farmers taking advantage of the common agricultural policy.
Romania is the second largest agricultural producer in Central Europe, after Poland, and it is only by capitalizing on European funding that this potential can be intelligently exploited and put to good use.
<D>
(SL) The two reports on the framework decisions form two further pieces in the jigsaw of a broad range of regulations, directives and other documents relating to the fight against terrorism.
I support both reports because I believe we need both framework decisions and because a reasonable balance has been struck between measures to ensure security and freedom of the individual.
I consider that in future the Commission and Council need to pay greater attention to the following issues.
Firstly, the burgeoning growth in anti-terrorism laws and the provision of greater transparency in such laws.
In this regard too, we have unnecessary and impractical laws or provisions in them which need to be rethought or repealed after assessment.
Secondly, the applicability of laws and thus the effective combating of terrorism do not depend solely on sound legislation but also on effective cooperation between the Member States and their police and security services.
Here we have not yet achieved the proper level of cooperation.
We need to examine and compare the control mechanisms available to the European Union and the Member States.
We need to pay particular attention to cases of database loss or misuse, and there should also be a mutual exchange of information on this matter between the Member States.
Finally, we need to do more to raise public awareness to make it easier for people to understand why certain measures are necessary.
Congratulations on both reports.
<D>
in writing. - I welcome the efforts made to further develop the EU's relations in the Euromed region, but I would like also to underline that the EU should not neglect its two other seas - the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea.
The Baltic Sea strategy will be one of the priorities under the Swedish Presidency.
Also, the Black Sea Synergy carries strategic importance.
The EU has to take care and find a common spirit in developing all these regions in a balanced manner.
The EU is an integrated community and the long-term strategic development of all its regions has equal importance.
There is clearly a need to have a close partnership with non-EU countries in the Mediterranean based on respect for human rights and the rule of law.
Regrettably, there are still several countries that have serious problems in this domain.
I urge the EU Member States to address these issues with the utmost seriousness.
Involving the Arab League is a significant opportunity to bring all states together to jointly find solutions for conflicts in the region.
I call on the EU Member States to take a balanced stand and play the role of negotiator rather than taking sides in different conflict situations.
Only by being balanced can we contribute to achieving long-term peace in Middle-East.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, as I underlined at the beginning of this important debate, the European Union has to play an increasing role in protecting the Arctic environment, in promoting sustainable exploitation of natural resources and in enhancing Arctic multilateral governance.
We are committed to the preservation of the Arctic and, at the same time, our aim is to contribute to a cooperative system that will guarantee sustainability, as well as free and equitable access.
In order to succeed in these important endeavours, we have to cooperate closely with all the Arctic states and Arctic stakeholders, as I have said.
In this regard, the Commission proposes to promote the full implementation and elaboration of existing obligations, rather than proposing new legal instruments in order to enhance security and stability.
Strict environmental management and sustainable use of resources, as well as open and equitable access.
At the same time, the EU has already highlighted that, for areas beyond national jurisdiction, the provisions on environmental protection under this Convention remain rather general, and we will continue to work within the United Nations towards the further development of some of the frameworks, adapting them to new conditions or Arctic specificities.
For example, a new UNCLOS implementation agreement on marine biodiversity beyond the areas of national jurisdiction could take the Arctic into account, and we have also submitted our application to the Norwegian chair of the Arctic Council.
The acceptance of the Commission's application requires the unanimous decision of all the members of the Arctic Council.
This decision, which is due on 29 April - i.e. very soon - might be negatively affected by an initiative that perhaps proposes an Arctic Treaty, so we should be careful about that.
Finally, let me say that the Arctic coastal states have a clear preference for the UNCLOS as a basis.
The European Union has to take this into account when we want to develop even stronger cooperation for the benefit of the Arctic, its inhabitants and its wildlife.
In this context, we should not weaken the existing frameworks for cooperation as this would not really serve our objectives and interests.
Nor would it correspond to the spirit of your own draft resolution.
In conclusion, I consider that the conditions are not yet right for an international treaty on the Arctic, and that we should rather focus our efforts on ensuring the effective application of the existing legal frameworks, thus filling the gaps that might exist, and adapting the rules to the specificities of the Arctic.
This seems much more feasible.
<D>
in writing. - (RO) The recently elected president of Ukraine is sending out an important signal by choosing Brussels as the destination for his first foreign visit.
Ukraine is a state with European aspirations and the fact that President Yanukovich is coming to the EU's capital to meet with the leading members of the Commission highlights that Kiev is looking towards the West.
The new Ukrainian president is faced with major challenges at a time when the International Monetary Fund has suspended the stand-by agreement signed with Kiev, due to numerous unfulfilled or breached commitments.
It is important that President Viktor Yanukovich does not forget the promises he made on the day he assumed his mandate.
Ukraine needs, as the new leader in Kiev pointed out, internal stability, as well as to combat corruption and consolidate the economy on healthy foundations.
Ukraine needs to regain the confidence of the business sector and international community to be able to successfully overcome the economic recession, exacerbated by an unstable political climate.
The conclusion of the electoral campaign and President Yanukovich's assuming office must signal an end to populist practices such as artificially increasing the population's income on an economically unsustainable basis.
President Yanukovich's inaugural speech gives hope to the international community that things can return to normal in Ukraine.
It remains in the period that now follows for these words to be demonstrated by actions as well.
<D>
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DA) Madam President, Mr Surján has chosen 'security' as the heading for the 2010 budget, the word being interpreted in its broadest sense: alleviation of the financial and economic crisis, its importance for jobs and economic security, the security of energy supplies, safe transport, the safety and security of citizens in relation to the problems caused by immigration and the problems arising as a result of demographic changes, with fewer young people to care for an increasing number of elderly people, the need for better environmental protection, the need to fight against terrorism and the need to promote safety and security through the EU's role in the world.
The heading 'security' indicates the many areas where the EU budget is important and how vital it is for the budget to reflect our needs.
In many ways, 2010 will be an exciting year for the EU budget.
For the structural funds, 2010 is the first year in which the 'n+3 rule' comes into play.
Those appropriations that have not been committed over the last three years according to the programme will lapse.
Now we will see whether the Member States have been able to utilise the appropriations in time.
I certainly hope that the sunset clause, the n+3 rule, will not come into play, but, if it does, there is certainly reason to look again at whether the rules for the structural funds are sufficiently flexible and unbureaucratic.
In 2010, foreign policy will, as in previous years, be a tricky issue.
I would urge the Commission to find the necessary appropriations, even though the ceiling for this category of expenditure is very low.
In the Committee on Budgets we had a number of discussions about our position with the regard to the EU's subsidising of the Nabucco gas pipeline.
I would like to emphasise that this is a point to which we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe attach a great deal of importance.
Energy security must be ensured by means of many different initiatives, but we would in particular like to see support for Nabucco, a project which, at the end of the day, is independent of Gazprom.
The budget procedure will be quite difficult this year.
This is, of course, election year.
The reports by Mr Maňka and Mr Surján represent the only opportunity that Parliament will get to express its opinion on the budget.
It will be the newly-elected Parliament that will have to do the actual negotiating with regard to the budget.
It is not easy to maintain the procedure we implemented last year with Mrs Haug as rapporteur and with the substantial involvement of the specialist committees.
We must, of course, do our best to ensure that the procedure is as open and structured as possible, and I am pleased to hear, Commissioner, that this is also something that you are going to do.
I think that both Mr Surján and Mr Maňka have provided a good proposal for doing this.
<D>
in writing. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the Klaus-Heiner Lehne report on a 'simplified business environment for companies' because I was convinced of the need for 'new' reforms in company law, accounting and auditing.
Company law is now strongly and, in my view, positively influenced by European rules.
We must prevent this from imposing unnecessary, excessively bureaucratic requirements while avoiding overlap with burdens which are already imposed under national rules.
These reforms will have to be aimed at making for easier reading of the applicable rules and reducing bureaucratic and administrative burdens, especially in accounting.
Simplification will be to the great benefit of undertakings, especially SMEs which as a general rule do not have large legal and accountancy departments.
I am convinced that understandable rules which are easy to apply will first and foremost foster compliance with the law.
At the same time, through clear rules which are easy to identify, the creation of a positive, active economic environment will be fostered.
I believe that the work both of the committee involved and of the rapporteur, Mr Lehne, has resulted in a fair compromise between requirements to comply with the principle of subsidiarity and the creation of a harmonised route for Member States which are engaged in a joint effort to simplify company rules at European level.
We must avoid creating bureaucratic obstacles which serve to muzzle dynamism and entrepreneurship to the point of suffocating them.
<D>
(ES) Mr President, on Wednesday 23 April UNESCO is celebrating World Book Day.
That is also the day on which Miguel de Cervantes died and William Shakespeare was born.
Miguel de Cervantes, the greatest figure in Spanish literature, is universally known for his Don Quixote; it is generally agreed that this book is the first modern novel and one of the finest works of literature in the world.
The English playwright, poet and actor William Shakespeare was born on a different 23 April, according to the Julian calendar, and is regarded as the most important writer in the English language and also one of the giants of world literature.
This is the day chosen by many countries of the European Union as the feast day of their patron saint.
This is the case in Catalonia, where it is traditionally the feast day of San Jordi, St George, a day for celebrating the Catalan language and culture.
I think it would be recognition of European cultures and literature for this Parliament to agree to join in these celebrations on a cultural and literary day which is so widely celebrated in the European Union.
<D>
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, much has just been said about what has become of this Payment Services Directive for which I was Parliament's rapporteur and which was adopted at first reading in 2007.
The purpose of this directive was, among other things, to give the various banking institutions, grouped within the EPC, the legal instruments necessary for the implementation of SEPA.
A European regulation has therefore been adopted for bank cards, credit transfers and direct debits.
SEPA is an integrated market for payment services in euros where there will be no difference between cross-border payments and national payments.
This situation will have benefits both for the banking sector and for consumers.
As you said, the Commission has committed itself to ensuring that migration to the SEPA instruments does not result in a more expensive payment system for the citizens of the European Union.
Since the adoption of this report, migration to SEPA has progressed very slowly, much too slowly.
On 1 October 2008, only 1.7% of transactions were made by way of the SEPA Credit Transfer format.
That is why, today, we are approving the European Parliament resolution calling on the Commission to fix an end date for migration to SEPA products.
This date must not be later than 31 December 2012, after which date all payments in euros should be made using the SEPA standards.
Before this migration can take effect, however, the sensitive problem, the sensitive issue of multilateral interchange fees, needs to be resolved.
These fees should not be abolished.
Payment services are a commercial activity.
It is legitimate to cover costs and keep a profit margin for participants.
On the other hand, opacity or arbitrariness should be avoided.
It is therefore appropriate for the Commission to lay down guidelines with respect to the application of these interchange fees.
In order to have more legal certainty, these guidelines must be known before the SEPA system for direct debits is launched.
Without this legal certainty, banks in many countries might not launch the direct debit system, and this could bring implementation of SEPA to a halt.
The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament have tabled very similar amendments along these lines for tomorrow's vote.
Obviously, we hope that they will be taken into consideration.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I would like to thank you for your comments and the views you expressed during the debate.
I am glad to see that the European Parliament and the Commission share views on actions to be undertaken to better fight against tax fraud and tax evasion in the European Union and I am pleased with the general support for the two proposals.
I would like to thank you again for the priority given to the savings taxation file and for your support for the Commission efforts to promote good governance in the tax area.
Achieving rapid progress in the discussions on the amending proposal is also one of the priorities of the Czech Presidency.
Due to the international climate - the financial and economic crisis - it is also a priority for most Member States.
I am convinced that, once Member States agree on ways of closing existing loopholes in the Savings Taxation Directive, it is likely that the Council will ask the Commission to update in a similar way the agreements with the five non-EU countries and the 10 other jurisdictions participating in the savings taxation mechanism.
It is premature to speculate today on how they will react to our approach.
The EU first needs to reach a unanimous agreement internally.
However, bearing in mind progress achieved in the G20 talks on meeting the OECD exchange of information standards, I am optimistic in this area as well.
As regards Mr Visser's report, I have indicated before that the Commission cannot accept Parliament's amendments but we have taken note of the recommendations contained in the report.
In particular, the need for better coordination between the different Member States, the necessary improvement of the quality of the information that is exchanged, the need to allow other Member States automated access to certain data contained in Member States' databases and the requirement to harmonise registration and deregistration procedures are ideas that are strongly supported by the Commission.
This is also the reason why the Commission will come forward, by the end of May, with a more substantive proposal for a recast of the regulation on administrative cooperation, where these proposals will be incorporated.
In conclusion, and as I have already mentioned on past occasions, it is clear that there exists no one single and global solution for eliminating tax fraud and tax evasion.
The proposals we have discussed today are two major steps forward within the framework of the global anti-tax fraud strategy at EU level.
<D>
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that tonight marks the beginning of a major project which Europe, the Member States and the regions and cities of the European Union have been waiting for for a long time, a goal that various stakeholders in the fields of education, employment, trade and the economy have been working towards for years, and something that society as a whole wants.
Tomorrow, with the approval of the European Qualifications Framework, we will lay the foundations for a better tomorrow, giving future generations a common point of reference for their cultural, educational and vocational engagement, training and of course employment.
In keeping with the Lisbon Strategy, the European Qualifications Framework represents a direct channel for improving links between schools, universities and the workplace, and between formal, informal and non-formal lifelong learning, ensuring transparency in the recognition of qualifications and certificates, both at national and sectoral level, and always within the European framework.
Finally, it will strengthen cooperation between Member States in the sensitive area of comparing different systems.
This is the recurring theme which, in accordance with the Lisbon Strategy, has led us to assume the proper responsibility, with a choice that I am certain will promote growth, development and competitiveness in a Europe obliged to recognise social cohesion as one of its objectives.
It is a longstanding project, arising from the Bologna process as the system of accumulation and transfer of credits as an equivalent, before surfacing again at the Barcelona Summit system for vocational training.
It was improved at Bergen in 2004, and again in the 2005 Council, which reiterated the need to adopt the current framework.
An historic journey that clearly illustrates the ambition of European decision-makers to create a new instrument, considered by many as revolutionary, but necessary for the European integration process which we have been persuing for so many years.
I am convinced, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, that this framework will not only encourage cross-border mobility, but will act as the driving force for the EU's internal mobility - if we think of students, workers, researchers and volunteers in general, and all those who need to move freely through Europe without causing panic or undue concern.
You must remember the story of the Polish plumber, which terrified France: it was one of the main reasons why the French voted against the European Constitution in the referendum.
Well, the text we now have before us is the result of many months' work, of close collaboration with the Council representatives under the Portuguese Presidency, which immediately saw the importance of this ambitious project.
The Commission, in the person of Commissioner Figeľ, has kept a close eye on this process throughout, and it is thanks to this spirit of partnership that we were able to improve the text, inserting key concepts close to the heart of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
For this, I am extremely grateful to my colleagues, to the shadow rapporteurs - I see Mrs Castex, Mr Kusstatscher, the liberals - as well as Mr Mann and Mr Kasoulides, and all those who contributed to this.
Thanks to their generous involvement and commitment, we were able to include the following concepts: social integration; the requirements of the labour market; personal development along different training paths; non-discrimination with the inclusion of disadvantaged persons; equal opportunities; respect for the principle of subsidiarity and the creation of coordination points within the Member States.
We also made sure that the recommendation was non-binding, even though it remains legislative in nature.
Obviously this was not down to any weakness, but came more from a sense of responsibility and realism in order to encourage and promote the application of this instrument in those countries that need more time.
In short, there is no doubt that it can be improved, but in this life everything can be improved.
However, I am convinced that we have before us a text with a soul and a conscience.
It is my belief that the job of the European Parliament is to legislate in the real interests of citizens.
Well, this is what we have done here.
The approval of the text at first reading is evidence of this, partly thanks to Mr Gaľa on the Committee on Culture and Education, the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, which all made a positive contribution.
<D>
President-in-Office of the Council. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I feel very honoured to be able to join you here today and to participate in discussions on a number of important topics relating to public health which are on today's agenda.
These include the application of patients' rights in cross-border healthcare, ensuring patient safety and joint EU action on rare diseases.
I would like to start by saying that all three issues are among the priorities of the Czech Presidency and they will also be on the agenda of the Council for Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Protection on 7 June 2009 in Luxembourg.
We therefore warmly welcome the forthcoming debate.
The Czech Presidency is fully aware of the important role played by the European Parliament in the legislative process in the area of public health, and it understands that close cooperation between the Council and Parliament is essential.
Your reports on these three topics have therefore come at the right time.
I would now like to say a few words from the perspective of the Council concerning the proposed directive of the European Parliament and the Council on applying patients' rights in cross-border healthcare.
The Czech Presidency is fully aware of the need to provide legal certainty for patients receiving healthcare in another Member State, and it is building on the results of the French Presidency's work in this area.
Our objective is to seek the approval of this text, which will be clear and comprehensible to EU citizens, which will respect primary law including the subsidiarity principle and which will fulfil the declared objective of establishing legal certainty for EU citizens concerning the application of their rights when receiving cross-border healthcare.
However, at the same time careful thought must be given to possible impacts of the proposal's implementation on the stability of healthcare systems in EU Member States.
In view of the fundamental importance of the proposal very intensive discussions have taken place and are still continuing in the legal bodies of the Council.
Therefore at present I am not able to tell you whether the Council will achieve political agreement at the end of the Czech Presidency, i.e. at the EPSCO Council in June.
However, I can make a number of general conclusions at this point.
The future directive should codify all of the case law of the European Court of Justice applying to the implementation of the principle of free movement of goods and services in the area of public health and it should also add a regulation on the coordination of social systems and provide Member States with the option of making healthcare provision in another Member State conditional on prior authorisation, or the option to apply a 'gate-keeping' system.
We find these principles in John Bowis's report on the proposed directive which you will be debating.
It is also possible to identify other topics that the European Parliament and the Council have in common: the importance of providing full and correct information to patients about options for receiving cross-border healthcare or the emphasis on ensuring high quality and safety in the provision of care.
The Czech Presidency appreciates the care taken by Parliament in drafting this report, the wording of which has emerged from numerous difficult but fruitful discussions in a number of relevant committees.
I am aware that the wording of the report represents a compromise between the various political groups and that finding this compromise has not been at all easy.
I would therefore like to thank everyone who took part in creating it and the rapporteur John Bowis, to whom we all wish a speedy recovery, of course.
This represents a valuable contribution, enabling the legislative process for proposed directive to continue further.
The Council will review the text of the report in detail, as well as all of the amendment proposals, and will carefully consider incorporating them into the common position of the Council in order to support a second-reading agreement.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as I mentioned earlier it is still too soon to say whether the June EPSCO Council will produce a political agreement on the proposed directive, as discussions based on the compromise proposal submitted by the Czech Presidency have not yet ended.
In any case, the Council will discuss this topic further, taking into account the report approved by the European Parliament.
<D>
The Council would like to point out that the free movement of people is one of the fundamental rights guaranteed in Community legislation and includes the right of EU citizens to live and work in another Member State.
At its meeting on 9 March 2009, the Council directed an invitation to those Member States that were still applying transitional rules restricting free movement.
At the time, based on the information available, the Council said that these Member States should consider whether to continue applying these restrictions.
The Member States were also urged to lift the restrictions during the third phase if no serious disturbances, or risk of serious disturbances, to the labour markets could be identified in the Member States concerned.
The Council also pointed out to the Member States that priority must be given to citizens from Member States over labour from outside the EU, and that the protection of citizens from new Member States who were already resident and employed in a Member State will remain during the transitional periods.
The rights of family members have also been taken into account in accordance with the practice in connection with previous accessions.
The Council emphasised the strong elements of differentiation and flexibility in the rules on the free movement of workers.
The Member States have declared that they will endeavour to grant increased access to the labour market to citizens from the new Member States concerned in accordance with national legislation, with a view to speeding up the approximation of their legislation in line with Community legislation.
In November 2008, the Commission put forward a communication on the impact of free movement of workers in the context of EU enlargement.
The Commission points out that workers from Bulgaria, Romania and the EU-10 Member States helped to meet a higher demand for labour in the receiving countries and thus made a significant contribution to sustained economic growth.
Evidence at hand suggests that post-enlargement intra-EU mobility has not led - and is unlikely to lead - to serious labour market disturbances.
The Commission also notes that the volume and direction of mobility flows within the EU are driven by general labour supply and demand rather than by rules restricting labour market access.
The Commission concludes that restrictions applied by the Member States may delay labour market adjustments and even exacerbate the incidence of undeclared work.
The free movement of labour is an important priority for the European Union.
The movement of labour helps to create more jobs, so that the economy can be adjusted even during an economic crisis.
The movement of workers also helps to reduce social marginalisation and poverty.
With regard to the transitional period for free movement that the honourable Member asked about, the Member States have the right to retain their restrictions up to the end of the third phase of the transitional period.
However, the Council believes that the economic crisis that Europe is currently experiencing should not be used as grounds for continuing to apply the transitional rules.
Even during periods when demand for labour is low, it can be difficult for employers to fill vacancies with applicants from their own country.
The Council regularly reviews the question of transitional arrangements.
The most recent review was at its meeting in June 2009, when the Council took note of the Commission's information on the impact of free movement in the context of EU enlargement.
The Commission informed the Council that three of the EU-15 Member States had, prior to 1 May 2009, notified the Commission of serious labour market disruptions or the risk of such disruptions.
Germany and Austria continued to apply restrictions on labour market access by retaining the requirement for a work permit, while the United Kingdom applies a system of ex post registration, which allows workers to start work but requires them to register within 30 days.
In the information it provided to the Council, the Commission also stated that it would ensure that the provisions of the Accession Treaty are complied with and it reserved the right to request clarification from those Member States continuing to apply restrictions.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, Montenegro is not just one of the world's most beautiful countries; it is also the Balkan country with the oldest tradition of independence in the modern era.
When Belgium was founded, Montenegro had already been independent for centuries and possessed the characteristics of a state.
I stress this because Montenegro is always wrongly dismissed as an example of a superfluous tiny land that suddenly found itself independent by a quirk of fate.
Let me say to Mr Markov that Montenegro was annexed by its Serbian ally after the First World War.
There was no question of voluntary union at that time.
A pro forma parliamentary vote was taken, but that was all.
There was a massive Montenegrin liberation movement, whose activities continued through the twenties and into the thirties.
Tito then restored Montenegro's independence within Yugoslavia, and under Tito's Yugoslav Constitution it had a right of secession.
When it tried to exercise that right, however, obstacles were placed in its way.
Today it is an independent country on the way to membership of the European Union.
We must support the democratic forces there.
As has already been said, its treatment of minorities is an example to many others in the region, which is why the minorities supported independence.
What it still needs, however, is a stronger system of independent education, such as that provided by the Franciscan school centre in Tuzi, near Podgorica.
Private education initiatives are needed to release the country from its rigidity.
I call on the government to keep moving vigorously along this path towards pluralism, not only in the economy but also in education and in the country's constitutional and democratic structures.
(Applause)
<D>
(SV) Mr President, EMAS, the voluntary Eco-Management and Audit Scheme, means, in principle, that a company or an organisation carries out an environmental review, examines its own impact on the environment, draws up an environment policy, sets targets and comes up with an action plan.
Unfortunately, EMAS has not been much of a success to date, in that only 4 200 organisations have registered with it since its establishment in 1993, which is a poor result compared with the 35 000 organisations within the EU which have achieved certification to ISO 14001.
This is why a review of EMAS is justified, quite simply in order to make it more attractive and reduce the amount of red tape for companies and organisations.
During the negotiations between the Council and Parliament, many aspects of EMAS were tightened up.
For example, the Commission is now required to draw up a comprehensive reference document for as many sectors as possible, on the basis of a priority programme.
The text also clearly states that the EMAS logo may not, under any circumstances, be confused with any other environmental product label.
This is a real improvement.
A while ago, my colleague, Jens Holm, asked the Commission whether or not all of the Commission's Directorates-General had registered with EMAS, as Parliament has.
One would think that EU institutions would have an obligation to set a good example, but the response was that the Commission does not operate any internal emission targets and that only five of the Commission's Directorates-General have registered with EMAS.
In my opinion, that is beyond contemptible and I would like to use this opportunity to put this question to the Commission again: when does the Commission intend to ensure that all of its Directorates-General join EMAS?
<D>
The French Presidency has set the right priorities, for example the climate, immigration and defence, but I should like to focus on one aspect that receives less attention but is nevertheless extremely important for our young people and the whole sports sector in Europe.
The French Presidency supports the 'six-plus-five' rule in sport: a restriction on the number of foreign players.
The objectives are good: obliging clubs to invest more in their own youth training and thus also going some way towards restoring the competitive balance.
This Parliament agrees with this one hundred per cent.
Hence our support for the 'home-grown' rule, which - albeit more modestly - has the same objectives in mind.
The question is whether the six-plus-five rule is feasible at European level.
It conflicts with the free movement of workers and can only be applied if a derogation is made from the EU Treaty, and we are a long way from this course of action.
It is doubtful whether the Court of Justice would ever accept such a thing, even in the light of the new article on sport in the Treaty of Lisbon.
We in Parliament want to join in the search for a solution that benefits European football.
We are simply calling for a solid solution, one that does not plunge football into chaos.
Nobody needs a Bosman Mark 2.
<D>
The most serious financial and economic crisis since the 1930s has hit Europe hard.
However, the developing countries are also suffering heavily from its effects and they are largely powerless to do anything about it.
Irresponsible speculation, greed for quick profits which are completely unrelated to the real economy in the Anglo-Saxon countries and a financial system that is coming apart at the seams have brought the world to the brink of a financial abyss.
Another cause of the crisis is a globalisation concept that has made complete deregulation its highest priority.
The countries of Europe are getting themselves ever deeper into debt in order to restart their economies.
However, in many cases, it is not possible for developing countries to do this because of their poor financial situation.
Therefore, they must be given the opportunity to protect their own national economies more effectively against imported goods which are sold at dumping prices and which destroy local markets and local people's livelihoods.
We must give the developing countries the chance to emerge from the crisis under their own steam.
Traditional development aid has largely failed in its purpose.
Ultimately, we have to tackle the root of the problem and impose strict regulations on the financial markets, prevent speculative practices and quickly introduce a tax on financial transactions.
The problem will certainly never be solved by the type of 'world government' proposed in the report, which will further disempower both people and states.
<D>
Mr. Chairman, Commissioner Fratini, Thank you for the understanding and the presentation on the intentions of the Commission.
I find it symbolic that precisely today, when the Charter of Fundamental Rights was signed, we are discussing a topic directly related to it.
For the growing extremism, the growing influence of extreme right-wing parties and organisations is a direct threat to the existence of the European Union.
It might sound too strong but our Union is based on clear principles and its existence is possible thanks to the fact that peace, solidarity, tolerance, mutual respect among ethnic and religious communities, and the peaceful co-existence of nations prevailed in Europe 50 years ago.
Today, the extreme right-wing attacks exactly these principles; it attacks the very heart of the European Union, without which it could not possibly exist.
But our Union is not an abstract construct; it is not just another administrative level of governance.
It is a union whose mission is to defend and protect the values underlying the whole world.
Willing or unwilling, prepared or unprepared, we have to understand that there are people deprived of fundamental rights, suffering from political reprisals, oppressed by non-democratic regimes or discriminated against on the basis of race, ethnic origin and religion in all parts of the world.
And, in all parts of the world, there is the hope that the European Union will support them and that the spirit of tolerance, guaranteed civil rights and social security can reach their country, too.
Can we be powerful and convincing in the outside world if we fail to cope with the problems in our own backyard?
How can we explain to the people who pin their last hopes on us that immigrants die just because of their origin, that ethnic minorities are subjected to systematic discrimination, that partisan ideologies challenge the equality of women or define homosexualism as a disease?
How can we explain that we are on the way of forgetting the gloomiest pages of our history and that young people praise Hitler and anti-Semitism is turning into the vogue of the day?
I cannot accept this and neither can my collegues Socialists.
I believe that there is no political group in this Parliament to remain indifferent to the fact that right-wing extremism, racism, xenophobia are gaining new grounds.
Didn't we become witness today how a historic landmark in the development of the European Union was disgraced in a vulgar manner by a noisy minority that could come back stronger, more aggressive and better organised in 2009?
Under the hypocritical demand for a referendum, it challenged not merely the Charter of Fundamental Rights but fundamental rights themselves.
It is this behaviour that we see also in many national parliaments encourages extremists who would resort to yet another punitive action tomorrow, inspired by this political circus.
We must name problems very clearly and seek solutions together.
Therefore we shall put this issue on the agenda of the Parliament over and over again.
Because extremism is an all-European challenge which necessitates the cocerted efforts at the European, national, regional and local level.
If the European Commission is the custodian of the EU Treaties, then the European Parliament is the custodian of the values and I believe that together we shall be able to withstand a rising wave familiar from the recent past.
And that we shall stop it, without violating fundamental rights like the right of free expression, the right of assocation, the freedom of the media.
For one can fight for democracy only according to the rules of democracy.
Breaking these rules will mean that extremism has prevailed.
Thank you.
<D>
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am one of those people who championed the irrelevant amendments in committee.
Yet in line with what Mrs Laperrouze said about coal, it is not at all clear to me why the Commission should stipulate subsidising coal ad infinitum, as it were.
Coal has been subsidised to an unbelievable extent for 50 years, and continuing this is contrary to all the EU's statements on climate policy.
We believe that, on the contrary, these coal subsidies should be replaced with more consistent support for renewable energies and energy efficiency.
Otherwise Europe will not be in a position to meet its targets on climate policy.
Steel is another story.
Yet the Commission has omitted to make it clear that steel continues to be subsidised and coal does not.
In my opinion sufficient provision has already been made for coal, a dirty energy source, in the Seventh Framework Research Programme.
<D>
The representatives of EU bodies often like to place great emphasis publicly on protecting the health of our citizens and protecting nature and the environment.
It is therefore striking that European regulations are almost suspiciously inconsistent when it comes to the use of a highly toxic chemical substance, cyanide, in the mining of precious metals.
It is well-known among professionals that cyanide is one of the most toxic of all chemical substances.
It gets into the organism by inhalation through undamaged skin or after use.
At sufficient concentrations, death follows in a few seconds or minutes.
The arguments of mining companies that they can ensure conditions for gold mining that will prevent the risk of damage to health or the environment have always proved worthless.
Sometimes, there is human error and sometimes nature springs a surprise.
This can be seen from dozens of serious accidents all over the world, which have resulted in the extensive destruction of nature, harm to health and also loss of life.
Let us recall just a few from recent years: Summitville in Colorado, Carson Hill in California, Brewer in South Carolina, Harmony in South Africa, Omai in Guyana, Gold Quarry in Nevada, Zortman-Landusky in Montana, Kumtor in Kyrgyzstan, Homestake in South Dakota, Placer in the Philippines, Baia Mare in Romania and Tolukuma in Papua New Guinea.
In all of these places, both the inhabitants and nature paid dearly for the greed of the modern-day gold diggers, facilitated by the indifference of the authorities.
Commissioner, the time has come to show the people of the EU what really matters to you: the environment and people's health and lives, or the profits of mining companies.
<D>
(FR) Mr President, I am one of those who was present at the start of the Galileo project, and so I am perhaps rather better placed to gauge the extent of the delay.
I believe that this project has two inherent defects.
Firstly, it is the first major Community project of industrial interventionism.
It has not been easy to persuade people that the EU could own a satellite navigation system, and it therefore took a long time to obtain a political consensus.
Secondly, the business plan could not be how it was imagined initially, simply because GPS, our major competitor, is free and is fully financed by the US government.
We needed to overcome these two initial problems and take stock of the situation, spurred on by the Slovenian presidency and by Mr Barrot, before establishing a remarkable consensus between the three institutions.
This tripartite dialogue has brought us to a point where we now have a document and a text.
Tomorrow will see the launch of Galileo, before the second satellite is launched on Saturday from Baikonur.
<D>
- (NL) Mr President, I wish to make a number of remarks on behalf of my group.
It really is a pity to have to conclude today that the Council has not really responded to the questions that Claudio Fava's January report raised partly on behalf of Parliament.
What has the Council actually done with the findings, both our findings and the findings of the Council of Europe?
Has there been no real consultation to prevent the practices described in these reports from happening again?
We are more positive about the Commission's response.
The Commission has embarked on an evaluation of anti-terrorism measures and how they are implemented.
I am very pleased indeed with the Commissioner's announcement just now about what can be done to prevent aircraft landing at European airports in the future, which are carrying people to be transported elsewhere unlawfully; we have to have a system of control for these so-called 'State aircraft'.
The next point is that we are, of course, pleased that another terrorism coordinator has been appointed and we wish him great success.
We were somewhat surprised at the sudden departure of Mr Gijs de Vries, who never gave the impression that he was really very keen on his job.
Hopefully the new coordinator will be, his position as coordinator will be strengthened and in future the new coordinator will be able to answer questions from Parliament if required.
I now turn to Mr Marty's report on the possible secret prisons in Poland and Romania.
I agree with the remarks already made here about the fact that the last report was based on anonymous witness statements.
Mr Marty still has to explain what the criteria are in the Council of Europe, when you can cite anonymous sources, and so we are not really satisfied with the way Mr Marty approached it.
A number of people were put in the dock and no new facts emerged.
I think that it is time for Mr Marty to say whether that list of names can be deleted, especially as two of our colleagues are on the list.
I said this before some time ago, when we spoke to Mr Marty in the committee.
I have one final point.
It is, of course, important to make clear to the citizens that the practices that have taken place in some EU countries, such as the abduction of people by secret services from outside the European Union, cannot happen again, that the CIA cannot be allowed to operate in Europe without any supervision by national authorities.
The Americans seems to operate under different rules from us.
Once again the recent examples of the refusal by the Americans to extradite people or to agree to deportation requests from Italy and Germany are a sign that we evidently operate under different standards.
These two examples give us food for thought about the manner of cooperation between the European Union and the United States when it comes to the fight against terrorism.
Do the Americans want to observe the same balance when it comes to security and human rights?
<D>
(SK) The third consecutive political crisis in Ukraine was probably the reason why the historic second EU-Ukraine Summit that took place in Paris at the beginning of September did not reach more ambitious conclusions concerning the Russia-Georgia conflict.
I appreciate that the European Union again declared its support for building civil society and for pro-democratic changes in Ukraine.
I also have a positive opinion on the agreement to begin a 'visa dialogue' that should, in the long run, result in a visa-free regime between both sides, as well as on the fact that, in spite of the new political crisis, Ukraine's road towards EU membership stays open.
Today no one has any doubt that the Orange Revolution changed the historical direction in which Ukraine was going.
Now Ukraine must show that it is stable and united.
This is its only chance to achieve a European perspective.
I am convinced that we can strengthen freedom at home only if we protect it outside the EU borders as well.
This is the reason why I will take part in the 11th session of the European Parliament's delegation to Ukraine on 2/3 October 2008 in Kiev and Jalta.
I believe that the presence of representatives of the European Parliament in Ukraine will contribute towards calming the situation and towards political stability in Ukraine.
<D>
(ES) Mr President, an important part of the future of Europe is at stake in the reform of the common fisheries policy.
The fishing sector is a resource and a way of life in our coastal areas, and forms the basis of our canning industry and marine research.
It is crucial for safety, quality and price in the supply of food to our consumers.
It is also crucial for external relations and development.
The reform must focus on responsible, sustainable and competitive fisheries.
It must accentuate the social dimension, give priority to the ecosystem and be integrated in the marine policy.
It is important to ensure the conservation and recovery of stocks and to revise the principle of relative stability.
The management policy based on TACs and quotas must leave room for effort-based management.
It is also essential to step up controls and put an end to unfair competition.
The small-scale fishing fleet and the areas that are highly dependent on fisheries need to be treated differently and need greater socio-economic support.
Shellfishing activities must be completely integrated into the common fisheries policy.
I support the report and I congratulate the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs on the compromises reached.
I call on the Commission and on the Council Presidency to give the report serious consideration in their future work.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, the idea of an Internet Governance Forum (IGF) was born at the World Summit on the Information Society in Tunis in November 2005 and defined as a non-binding forum for multi-stakeholder policy discussion.
The Commission supports the Forum in this form.
Two meetings have been held so far: in 2006 in Athens and 2007 in Rio.
The Commission welcomes the forum in each form.
The Commission also welcomes the participation of Parliament at the forum and is grateful for the excellent cooperation on both meetings.
As in the previous year, the meeting in Rio provided an excellent framework for enriching exchanges which allowed the gathering of a range of views on the relevant issues.
Therefore, the Commission sees value in upholding the main characteristics of the forum, notably the participation of the various stakeholders and its non-binding nature.
I would like also to thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to say something more concrete on the IGF (we have adopted this abbreviation) which took place in November in Rio de Janeiro.
Firstly I would like to thank very much Ms Trautmann, Mr Harbour, Mr Badia i Cutchet and Mr Hökmark, who represented Parliament at this meeting, for their active participation and for the continuation of their excellent cooperation.
This allowed us - this year again - together to highlight a number of European priorities such as freedom of speech, bridging the digital divide, security and child protection on-line.
It is important for Europe to bring such issues to the forefront of the international agenda on a constant basis.
The Commission supports the IGF.
This concept, elaborated during the World Summit on the Information Society, is still very valuable, and all the issues which have been mentioned are very much in favour of what we are trying to step up as actions in this particular field.
In fact, on a broad range of internet-relevant subjects, the number of participants - around 3 100 - clearly demonstrates that there is indeed interest in having such a place for discussions.
The fact that there is no negotiated text as an outcome of the Forum should be seen as a strength rather than as a weakness of the process.
The Forum allows for open exchange, without the pressure of defending a particular outcome in a binding document.
This can serve as a basis for improving understanding of each other's concerns and can pave the way for finding common solutions.
Dynamic coalitions stemming from the Forum are, in fact, one example that the IGF can work as a platform where people who share common interests can further cooperate.
Thus, the Rio Internet Governance Forum meeting again provided an excellent framework for enriching exchanges, which allowed a range of views on relevant issues to be gathered.
I would also like to thank once again Members and hope we will continue our excellent cooperation, because this is one of the most promising areas for our future work.
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, sometimes, in this Chamber, we cannot really see the political differences between groups, but, on this issue, the difference is very visible, because I could not disagree more with the rapporteur on some of the points she just mentioned.
I respect the work she has done on this report, but on this issue we have totally different views on what should be done by the Commission.
First of all, this report is about the Lisbon Strategy and what we should do to restore Europe's global competitiveness.
This is really the only way to guarantee European welfare and the welfare of our citizens.
Without taxation, this is impossible.
Taxation has a crucial role to play in this respect, in bringing competitiveness to Europe.
We must remember that overall tax levels in Europe are still above the OECD average.
In order to achieve a lower level of taxation in Europe, we need to create an environment conducive to investment.
We need more investments, more growth, and more, flourishing businesses in Europe.
Healthy tax competition has a beneficial role in this respect.
This is an economic, market-based control mechanism against rampant political decisions.
If we have fruitful tax competition in Europe, governments cannot put obstacles in the way of the single market.
That is what we want: a genuine single market without tax-made obstacles.
On the other hand, there is no evidence that fruitful tax competition would erode tax bases.
The total tax revenue has remained remarkably stable, thanks to increased economic activity.
However, the existence of 27 different tax regimes creates problems, particularly for European SMEs, which are so important to this growth.
According to a 2004 EC taxation survey, compliance for small SMEs costs about 2.6% of their sales and 31% of taxes paid.
So, one third of all the tax goes to compliance.
The high proportionate amount of tax compliance for small companies is a big obstacle, and that is why we need to do our best to call for cross-border loss relief, simplified customs procedures, one-stop-shop schemes for VAT, home states taxation pilot projects and so on.
We support everything that the Commission has done in this respect.
Finally, industry wishes to see a well-managed and simple tax administration system.
We need to resolve the problems of transfer pricing, loss offsetting EU-wide and avoiding double taxation, and to lower our compliance costs.
We welcome the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB) proposal, and the fact that the Commission is stable and brings us the proposal on CCCTB, because loss-relief is only a temporary thing.
In the end, we need a consolidated corporate tax base.
<D>
in writing. - (EL) As a result of the anti-popular, anti-labour aims of the Maastricht Treaty, the EMU and euro were created, preparing the ground for the reactionary Lisbon Treaty and the escalating attack on workers' rights and freedoms.
The centre-right and centre-left have ratified these EU and government decisions.
In Greece, New Democracy, PASOK and the Left-Wing Coalition have voted in favour of the Maastricht Treaty.
There has been a refusal to hold referendums.
This serves capitalist interests admirably and shows how much capitalists fear popular reaction.
Transferring a key economic policy mechanism from Member States to the control of the ECB has helped capitalists to reduce the cost of labour and multiply profits.
The squeeze on wages, which the ECB has encouraged since its very foundation, has led to a sharp fall in workers' purchasing power, a rapid deterioration in the working class family's standard of living and to poverty.
In most countries, the EMU and euro are increasingly being brought into question.
The arguments about price stability, protection of economies, etc., have proved to be a sham.
The euro protects only the profits of monopolies; it facilitates privatisation and mergers, and paves the way for even greater exploitation.
<D>
(PL) Thank you for the opportunity to discuss this issue.
I believe that all of us in this Chamber want the same thing.
We want to cooperate with Russia.
We also want a stable, predictable political situation in Europe.
Russia certainly also needs us - the European Union - as it wants to sell gas and crude oil, but, most of all, because it has its own internal and external problems.
Russia needs our stability, responsibility and strength.
How, therefore, do we in this Chamber differ from one another?
We differ in the manner in which we wish to proceed in our relations with Russia, in order to achieve the European Union's goals, not only in economic terms, but also in terms of respecting the principles and the system of values in which we believe.
I would like to give you an example from my own experience.
In 2001, relations between Russia and Poland were very good indeed, and the Polish Foreign Minister was received in Moscow with honours.
The Russian Prime Minister came to Warsaw and negotiated important issues pertaining to our mutual relations, especially in the field of energy.
He even extended his visit by one day, a move that is rare under normal circumstances.
This in spite of the fact that, just under two years earlier, in 1999, Poland expelled a dozen or so Russian diplomats, who were involved in a variety of activities, none of which had much to do with diplomacy.
A short crisis then followed, until the Russians finally acknowledged that it is worth talking to us and taking joint action with us, and this was because when we are in the right, we have the strength to stand our ground.
The Russians are a proud people with great traditions.
They appreciate resoluteness and strength in others, more than complicated explanations which say that 'black is not quite black'.
When were are clearly in the right, a tough, resolute position is the only solution.
<D>
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for this communication, for this chance both to take stock and to look at what we need to do for tomorrow.
The euro is a success, no-one doubts that.
The euro has protected us.
What kind of state would our financial markets, our currencies be in with the turbulence of today's world, if we did not have the euro?
But this success has strings attached.
It means we have to be even more daring, because we are not a simply monetary area; we have a particular responsibility.
Yes, the euro is a success, and yet it reveals some of our intrinsic failings.
We often do better on the defensive than on the offensive.
We often do well when it comes to totting up points, something that the Stability Pact enables us to do, but when it comes to organising the best possible game, to optimising the potential offered by the single currency, we are often below par.
This is true within the EU.
Why do we not use our currency to improve our ability to implement the Lisbon strategy?
Why do we not use our currency to implement the objectives we have set ourselves for energy and the environment?
As for outside the EU, you talked about this and I agree with your diagnosis.
You propose mechanisms for improving multilateral surveillance, and you are undoubtedly right, but this is based on two premises.
The first is that the long-term presidency of the Eurogroup, held by Mr Juncker, has brought improvements in the way in which this body operates.
The second is that the independence of the European Central Bank is not in question and cannot be challenged by anyone.
Starting from these two premises, we still have a lot to do and I am counting on you, Commissioner, to restore some balance to the Economic and Monetary Union, which is still out of balance.
The economic arm of it has required improvement from day one, as we know, and we need to work out how it should be reformed as it moves forward.
Ten years on, we still have a lot to do.
Today, the questions we have been asking from the start need to be addressed, though obviously in quite a different context now.
We need to look at this context in the light of two major phenomena.
The first is obviously the current crisis that has come from the United States, which reflects the fact that we are in the second stage of globalisation, where inflation is back and which is marked by a euro/dollar exchange rate unfavourable to our exports - though it does have its advantages - and which is also marked by an unbelievable rise in the prices of commodities, oil and food.
The second element of context we have to take account of is the Treaty of Lisbon, which changes things for the Eurogroup, giving it new responsibilities in terms of external representation and coordination.
We need to be aware of this and really get the most out of the potential of this Treaty.
Commissioner, you ask us to help reach a consensus.
If it is a good one, we will be there.
However, we also think that perhaps there is a need to go further, with concrete proposals.
If I have understood you correctly, you would like to receive a roadmap from the Council.
Very well!
You must tell us, though, under what conditions the European Parliament will have its say in the proposals this will contain for improving the governance of the euro, so that the potential of this currency is deployed fully for the benefit of citizens and so that in the future there is greater acceptance of the European Central Bank by our fellow citizens.
The fact that it has become an institution perhaps allows us to look again at the way its members are appointed.
You know that this Parliament is on your side, that it is the Commission's ally when the Commission wants to move forward, but we will also be a demanding ally.
Do not listen just to the Council; regardless of what is written in the treaties, take account of any excellent proposals that might come from the European Parliament too.
<D>
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs. - (PL) Madam President, European framework legislation on telecommunications was adopted in the 1990s, effectively freeing national markets from state monopolies.
It resulted in a significant fall in the prices of calls offered by competing operators.
Recent years have seen revolutionary changes in communication technology: cell phones and the development of the Internet and wireless networks have diametrically changed the face of telecommunication.
EU law must reflect these changes, including the social implications.
Some 15% of Europeans are disabled, and by 2020 the elderly will constitute 25% of society.
It is precisely these people with special needs who should be provided with easier access to telecommunication services.
It is necessary to ensure cost-free access to a common alarm number, 112, for people throughout the Union, including users of Internet telephony, and to other electronic voice communication services.
Furthermore, customers must have the right to be fully informed both of the legal obligations arising from the use of a given service, for example with respect to author's rights, and of the legally imposed restrictions.
Above all, the key to better consumer protection is precise definition of the responsibilities of national regulatory bodies with respect to the day-to-day exercise of consumers' rights.
<D>
(PL) Madam President, the events of recent years, or months, even, but also the efforts made by individual countries and regions, indicate the growing importance of transparency not only for individual companies, but also for the development of specific states' economies.
One barrier to direct regulation of the activities of hedge funds is the global nature of this industry and the potential for a fund's offices to move to another state in order to avoid being subject to national regulations.
This is the main reason why all international institutions dealing with hedge funds try to influence fund activities through their relations with entities that are subject to regulation, especially banks.
The problems of transparency in the European Union are concentrated mainly on convergence and harmonisation of the law in Member States.
The problem areas relating to transparency aspects may be summarised as follows: establishing unified standards for information disclosed by companies introducing their shares onto the stock market and company law and corporate governance in relation to the question of the collective responsibility of agencies for information contained in company reports, reinforcing the role of independent council members, standards in the area of setting up committees as part of councils, disclosure of information on council and board members' reimbursements, and also increasing investor protection.
The introduction of unified regulations, creating better conditions within the European Union for hedge fund action and distribution, could have a positive impact on their development in Europe, but the introduction by individual countries of their own, individual regulations relating to these funds is not helping to create a unified, common European market.
The establishment of common and transparent principles would considerably facilitate fund product distribution.
In the opinion of the European Commission, which received a request to review the framework principles relating to non-harmonised products like hedge funds, with a view to creating a pan-European market, there are no significant arguments for the creation of EU regulations on hedge funds.
Nothing could be more wrong!
I side with the rapporteur's call for the Commission to present a legislative conclusion on the transparency of hedge funds and private equity.
<D>
The final draft of the agenda for this part-session, as laid down by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday 8 November pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure, has been distributed to you.
The following amendments have been requested to this draft agenda:
Tuesday:
The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has requested that a statement by the Council and the Commission on the shipping accidents in the Black Sea be placed on the agenda for Tuesday afternoon, after Mr Leinen's report, with a corresponding extension of the afternoon sitting until 6.30 p.m.
This would mean that questions to the Commission would not commence until 6.30 p.m. and would thus be half an hour shorter.
Who would like to justify the motion?
If there is nobody to speak for or against this motion, that is the end of the matter.
(The motion lapsed)
Wednesday:
The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance requests that a statement by the Council and the Commission on the situation in Georgia be included and dealt with in a joint debate with the report by Mr Obiols i Germà and Mr Tannock, and that the afternoon sitting therefore be extended to 6.30 p.m. and questions to the Council shortened by half an hour.
They also request that the debate on Georgia be concluded with the tabling of motions for resolutions and that voting on the matter be carried out during the November part-session in Brussels.
Who would like to justify the motion?
<D>
in writing. - (HU) Smoking is a major public health problem that claims several hundred thousand victims every year, including non-smokers.
As this is a problem on a global scale, it calls for multifaceted action, commitment on the part of Member States, and effective legislation that is even tougher than hitherto.
Protection of European citizens' health demands this.
Clearly, the road to achieving the primary objective, a smoke-free Europe, will be a long one, requiring tremendous effort and commitment.
For this reason, we have to take things one step at a time.
Several Member States have set an example that we should follow, taking sound and effective action to avert the dangers of passive smoking.
One of the next steps should be to introduce a complete ban on smoking in all enclosed workplaces, including the catering sector, all public buildings and all public transport within two years throughout the whole of the European Union.
To combat smoking successfully, we need a sound basis, a comprehensive Community strategy based on relevant studies and the best empirical knowledge, aimed at controlling smoking and encouraging people to quit.
Planning effective legislative measures, prevention and education all have a key role to play in such a strategy.
<D>
(ES) Madam President, Commissioner, it goes without saying that I congratulate the representatives of the Commission and Parliament on the work they did in Bali.
I shall adopt a more Euro-centric, more Euro-centrist view in addressing this and associated issues, as follows:
I should like to start by saying as has been said, although slightly differently, that necessity offers opportunities.
The greater the need, the greater the opportunity.
What are we facing?
We are facing two needs: one is to combat the effects produced by climate change, mainly as the result of development and population growth; the second is to resolve issues concerning the supply of traditional sources of energy whose use is shrouded in uncertainty either because they are becoming more scarce or because they are located in areas where the geopolitics is complex.
What is there an opportunity for?
There is an opportunity to develop efficient forms of energy which allow us to continue to be competitive, and which are clean and non-polluting; and also to guarantee supply because these are new forms of energy.
Wherein lies the problem?
In my view, there is a leadership deficit in the European institutions when it comes to tackling these issues, a deficit in the Commission and in Parliament.
There is one simple reason for this, namely that we are not able to explain that clean energy is made up of both renewables and nuclear energy.
This is not being done, this is not being explained, and it is the job of leaders to put solutions forward even though they may be difficult to discuss at a particular time.
Are we going to find ourselves in the paradoxical situation where China, India and other emerging economies have cleaner energy because they have developed nuclear sources and, what's more, can compete with lower salaries?
This is a matter which simply must be addressed, Commissioner.
I hope therefore that in Parliament and the Commission the nuclear energy question can be discussed calmly but decisively as we are continually pussy-footing around it and turning our backs on it.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, first of all on the issue of the inclusion of overseas countries and territories, I wish to clarify that the regulation does not apply to them, since the scope of the proposal does not cover vessels flagged with overseas countries and territories.
However, it does apply to the outermost regions, which are considered Community waters.
I agree with those who have supported this proposal as it stands, with its wide scope in order to make all agreements more effective and to ensure more value for money, in line with the overall objectives set by the Committee on Fisheries itself and others, like the Court of Auditors.
On the amendments, let me again say that some of the amendments are accepted, as I indicated.
Others have been overtaken by virtue of the first Presidency compromise text or because the proposed amendments are already provided for elsewhere in the regulation or in some other legal provisions.
I would like to repeat that all fisheries agreements under which Community vessels fish are to be included in the scope of the proposal.
This is essential, because the states party to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, as I said before, are responsible for the vessels flying their flags.
Secondly, the reallocation of under-utilised fishing opportunities is there to optimise utilisation of fishing opportunities under the fisheries agreements.
This is, after all, only proper management of fisheries agreements and it will not undermine relative stability, given that Article 13(6) of the proposal states the following: 'Transmission of applications in accordance with this article shall not in any way affect the future allocation of fishing opportunities amongst Member States.'
So it will be a reallocation to maximise the fishing opportunities granted or available under fishing agreements and not a means whereby a precedent would be set which would undermine relative stability.
Finally, I would also like to say that this provision is becoming a regular feature of fisheries partnership agreements with third countries and it has also been included, with the agreement of the Council, in the Greenland agreement.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, I also took part in the debate this morning.
I did not have the impression that you were unfair or abused your office in any way.
On the contrary...
(Uproar)
I would like to say, on the contrary, that you listened with great patience and respect as the chairman of this so-called group demonstrated to us that he is a professional slanderer.
That was the reality of Mr Farage's speech.
(Applause)
<D>
President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by responding to Mrs Flautre, also to Mr Romeva I Rueda and to those who spoke of the need to have an appraisal, to have an evaluation and impact assessments.
This does indeed seem very important to me, and the Council shares Parliament's concern to be able to take these sanctions decisions, and to update them, on the basis of the best possible information.
The existing measures are regularly re-evaluated on the basis of impact assessments and the Council bases its decisions as often as possible on reports from the heads of mission in the country, who are best placed to judge their effectiveness.
The Council has also considerably developed its consultations with local and international non-governmental organisations, and today Parliament has shown that it has a very important role to play in this evaluation.
What is also true, however, is that sanctions are an instrument that must remain political in nature.
We do need to have a strategy from the point of view of methodology, but we cannot fence ourselves in, nor can we give the process an automatic nature - I just want to say that as clearly and responsibly as possible here - therefore there will always be differences in our assessment.
To answer Mrs Koppa as well, whose speech was very sophisticated, sanctions remain a political instrument.
They are not the only instrument for promoting human rights.
There are two other instruments which stigmatise the countries they are targeting less, but which are also a tool for promoting human rights, and these are the conditionalities provided for in the enlargement policy of the Stabilisation and Association Process with the Balkans and the Neighbourhood Policy, and mandatory human rights clauses in all the agreements that the European Union enters into with third countries or groups of countries, the violation of which can lead to the suspension of these agreements.
I would like to reassure Mrs Koppa that there is no embargo on pharmaceutical products, but a system of control where these products have dual uses and are therefore subject to the non-proliferation regime.
The Council shares the view of many that sanctions should remain targeted and should not affect civilian populations.
Mr Cappato and Mr Gawronski also raised an important issue, and several speakers came back to the question of environmental damage.
At the moment, damage to the environment does not feature among the objectives of the common foreign and security policy, so it is true that from that point of view, it is not taken into account and we should be thinking about whether to include damage to the environment where it constitutes a threat either to international security or to the rights of people, to human rights.
That is a discussion we need to start.
I would also like to say to Mr Cappato that in the cases mentioned, energy sanctions have already been used by the European Union and this has been in a variety of circumstances.
I just wanted to go over a few cases that several of you mentioned: recent events, obviously.
Concerning the war between Russia and Georgia, I would say very clearly here that sanctions cannot achieve their aim if the consequence is to break off all contact with the country concerned, in this case Russia.
Finally, we also need to think about whether imposing sanctions in this case would be in Georgia's interest.
I would ask you all to think about that.
I will also come back to what has been said about the benchmarking process.
It was mentioned by Mrs Saks.
It is a very important issue, particularly as regards Uzbekistan; it is true, having been there for a conference on Central Asia and the European Union's presence in Central Asia.
When I was there I also met Mrs Tadjibaeva, a political prisoner, who has now been released; we hope that her health will improve and she can be given the proper care, but I was also able to see that a good benchmarking policy meant that progress could be achieved and that there was commitment from the authorities to meeting more fully the criteria defined by the European Union.
As it happens, we will be returning to the country in October.
As regards Cuba and those who mentioned it, I would like to remind you that the sanctions against Cuba were lifted in June 2008, which is not stopping us from keeping up rigorous monitoring of human rights developments in the country.
Those were the clarifications I wished to make at the end of this extremely detailed and rich debate, which demonstrates the necessity of Parliament's involvement.
<D>
Congratulations to my colleague Mrs Lynne on drawing up her report and on having achieved a political compromise that takes account of the opinions of the different political groups regarding the social realities within the Union.
It is true that the Member States' governments are directly responsible for reducing poverty.
It is their duty to take measures to ensure that people have jobs, children attend schools and the poorest people are given social assistance.
However, the Union's role in solving problems connected with poverty and inequality continues to be equally important.
The fact that 78 million European citizens live in poverty and the social divide between the poor and the rich is getting bigger and bigger is a most serious indication that action should be taken at both national and European level.
Most Member States have adequate minimum income rates.
However, there are still cases where the employers do not pay the established rates, thereby breaking the law.
As I have mentioned before on more than one occasion, Lithuanians working abroad happen to experience such unlawful treatment.
We should not tolerate employers carrying out such practices.
I welcome the Member States' response to the Council's call to reduce child poverty.
However, they have not yet drawn up their action plans for tackling the problem.
The disabled and elderly are particularly vulnerable.
We must make sure they have access to at least minimal long-term care at affordable prices.
The Social Fund has allocated resources for this.
It is a shame they remain unused in my country.
I do agree with the rapporteur's position on the necessity of sharing experience and following the successful examples of achievements in Social security.
It is necessary to learn from those Member States that are making efficient use of resources allocated by the EU, to share their experience.
Ladies and gentlemen, in order to gain our citizens' trust in the European Union, in its institutions, we must solve the most difficult problems they face.
In the speech he gave in this House, Nicolas Sarkozy, the President of France, said that the French feel that the EU does not care about them and does not provide social security.
French citizens have voted not against the Constitution, but against Europe, as they do not feel safe there.
The Commission has promised to prepare a report based on the social realities, with an analysis of social trends.
I do hope the main focus of this report will be the framework of actions, the framework that will define the methods of reducing or even abolishing poverty in Europe.
Then we will be able to win the support of our citizens and perhaps start to feel that we are working for them.
<D>
in writing. - (PT) I am pleased about the adoption of this report on the European citizens' initiative introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon, which has the objective of assigning to citizens the same powers of political initiative as those currently enjoyed by the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament.
Each initiative will have 12 months to collect one million signatures, which need to come from at least a quarter of Member States, currently seven.
The minimum number of signatories per country varies from 74 250 in Germany to 3 750 in Malta.
In Portugal's case, the minimum number of signatories required to support an initiative will be 16 500.
The validity of declarations of support will be gauged by the Member States.
In Portugal, an identity card, passport or citizen's card number will need to be included.
Signatories should be EU citizens and be old enough to be able to vote in European elections (18 in Portugal).
It will then be up to the Commission to analyse the initiative and decide, within a timeframe of three months, if it will put forward European legislation on the issue.
The Community's executive will then have to 'indicate the measures that it intends to take, and the reasons that justify these or not'.
This justification will be made public.
<D>
(PL) Mr President, as I take the floor in this debate on tax treatment of losses in cross-border disputes, I should like to highlight the following issues.
Firstly, direct taxation, such as corporate tax, does not fall within the competence of the European Commission.
As a matter of principle, therefore, the Commission should not concern itself with it.
Secondly, I am surprised to see that the report contains statements disapproving of the reductions in corporate income tax rates introduced in certain Member States, notably new ones.
Thirdly, I am worried by the Commission's call for work on the introduction of a consolidated corporate tax base within the European Union to be speeded up.
The nature of such a tax, its rate and setting the tax base are some of the very few instruments that still remain within the remit of the Member States and can be used to accelerate the economic development of less developed countries.
Fourthly, a study of the Commission's proposals for a consolidated corporate tax base suggests that the aim is to ensure all Member States develop at a rate involving at most a 2% rise in GDP per annum.
In such a scenario, how would the new Member States that are 20 or 30 years behind the more developed ones ever manage to catch up?
<D>
(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, this report, which Chris Davies has drawn up on the initiative of the Environment Committee, should signal to the Commission that the European Parliament is serious about reducing CO2 emissions.
When I see the amendments on the table, I start to wonder about that.
There are three points we should bear in mind.
Firstly, from 1 January 2012, new cars in Europe must not emit more than 120g of CO2 per kilometre.
We should not tamper with that date or the emission limit.
In 1998 the car industry made a voluntary commitment to reduce CO2-emission levels in its new vehicles.
In the light of news reports about the continuing advance of climate change, I see no reason at all for us to interfere with the deadline or the ceiling.
Secondly, future legislation must spell out clearly that the CO2 emissions of all cars must be reduced.
Large cars must make a greater contribution, but smaller cars must contribute too, so that we can achieve 120 grams by 2012.
My third point is that cars must remain affordable for people.
I agree with the previous speaker on that.
I come from a predominantly rural area, where people are dependent on cars to get them to their places of work.
For this reason, future legislation must perform a balancing act to reconcile the needs of the environment with those of the economy.
What good are strict emission limits if people can no longer afford new cars and drive about in their ageing vehicles?
It takes more than eight and a half years to renew the entire fleet of passenger cars on Europe's roads, and this must be in the back of our minds when we adopt new legislation.
Future legislation on CO2 emissions from passenger cars should be guided by the need to guarantee better protection of the climate as well as affordable driving.
<D>
(SK) My father, Štefan Kányai, who spent over ten terrible years in Russian gulags in the Urals, Karaganda and Kazakhstan, often said to me: 'There are witnesses still living who saw and remember Stalin's genocide, a mass murder that was committed without weapons.
Stalin's regime ripped out many pages from the annals of European history and your duty is therefore to open archives in the former Soviet Union and to replace those missing pages.
The memory of the victims is sacred and therefore you must act!'
I feel enormously moved that my name, together with the names of my colleagues in the PPE-DE Group and the names of colleagues from other political groups, is to be found at the head of a resolution through which we confirm that European integration is based on a readiness to come to terms with the tragic history of the 20th century.
May this resolution, coming as it does in 2008, the 75th anniversary of the famine, be a mark of our fellow feeling for the people of Ukraine and especially the survivors of the famine, as well as the families and relatives of the victims.
May this resolution be a lesson for a new generation which has not experienced persecution.
Freedom is precious and must not be taken for granted.
Evil still exists and must be confronted.
<D>
(EL) Mr President, the successful completion of negotiations on the conclusion of Economic Partnership Agreements between the European Union and APC countries is the ultimate challenge for European trade and development policy.
What we need are agreements which are compatible with the European Union's international obligations, given that the unilateral preferential treatment which the European Union has granted APC countries compared with other developing countries has, as you know, been found to be incompatible with WTO rules.
However, over and above the legal question, the challenge consists primarily in achieving agreements which will promote the development of the countries in question through the strengthening of their trading capacity, the diversification of their economic base and regional integration.
The new trading regime which will govern relations between the European Union and APC countries should ensure that all these countries are integrated into the international trading system, into the global economy, an economy which is going through an unprecedented crisis, a crisis which is affecting both developed and developing countries and emerging economies.
We all agree that the opening of APC countries towards the European Union must be asymmetrical and gradual, with adequate flexibility in terms of quotas in sensitive sectors and effective safeguarding clauses.
As you know, the objective of the negotiations was to cover sectors such as services, investments, intellectual property rights and reinforced work on commercial matters, as well as access to the goods market.
We therefore support the extension of the scope of the agreements to the extent deemed beneficial to the APC countries themselves.
It is absolutely vital to include development provisions in Economic Partnership Agreements and to provide adequate aid for trade.
<D>
President-in-Office of the Council. - Let me begin by saying that I appreciate the question on SMEs, because during this current economic crisis the big businesses and the big companies are always strong enough to lobby for some relief, but it is much more difficult for SMEs and it certainly requires a systemic approach.
On 1 December 2008, as you know, the Council endorsed the European Economic Recovery Plan, which was presented by the Commission on 26 November 2008.
As a response to the financial crisis, the Council supported a stimulus which is equivalent to about 1.5% of the EU's gross domestic product to restore business and consumer confidence.
Furthermore, the plan contains specific measures to support SMEs, the most important of which are those aimed at improving access to finance for SMEs and reducing the administrative burden.
The Council also agreed that improvements in the framework conditions for European businesses, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises, was essential to counter the effect of the crisis on competitiveness and to support and enhance job creation.
The Council also adopted two sets of conclusions related to providing support for SMEs, in the context of overall competitiveness.
Firstly, conclusions endorsing proposals to support SMEs presented in the Commission Communication entitled, as you probably know, 'Think Small First: a Small Business Act for Europe', this so-called SBA, including an action plan outlining the priority measures requiring particular attention.
Secondly, conclusions from the Commission communication entitled 'Towards world-class clusters in the European Union - implementing the broad-based innovation strategy'.
Although clusters are not exclusively meant for the SMEs, they play an important role in many clusters that have been set up throughout the EU.
At its meeting in mid-December 2008, the European Council approved this European Economic Recovery Plan and supported the full implementation of the Action Plan for the Small Business Act.
It has specifically supported an increase in the intervention by the European Investment Bank to the tune of EUR 30 billion for the years 2009-2010, especially for loans to SMEs, which amount to an increase of EUR 10 million over the EIB usual lending in this sector.
The Council also supported a temporary exemption for two years beyond the de minimis threshold for state aid in respect of an amount of up to EUR 50 000 and the adaptation of the state aid framework as required to increase support for enterprises, especially the SMEs.
The Council also called for the use of accelerated procedures for awarding public contracts provided for EC legislation, as well as for reducing the administrative burden on businesses.
The Czech Presidency will continue to pursue this effort, because our economy is broadly based on SMEs, so we have our own experience with that.
Therefore, both of the forthcoming Competitiveness Councils under the Czech Presidency - one will take place very soon in early March, as well as the informal one which will take place in Prague - will tackle the question of reducing the administrative burden, since we believe that better regulation is an important factor for improving competitiveness, in particular for SMEs, and it plays an even more important role in times of economic crisis.
Moreover, the Presidency will try to make progress in the implementation of the action plan and put this SME policy at the forefront of society as well as linking the implementation of the action plan to the national reform programmes of all the Member States.
The Presidency will also continue with the increased effort of discussing legislative proposals related to SMEs, such as the regulation on the Statute for a European Private Company, which would offer SMEs a form of business enabling them to take advantage of their potential and develop cross-border activities.
Another legislative proposal I should mention is the proposed directive for reduced VAT rates for labour-intensive services, which will be discussed at the upcoming ECOFIN Councils.
In addition, the Council will be concerned with the review of the Late Payment Directive, which is now being prepared and which is to ensure that small and medium-sized enterprises are paid in time for all business transactions.
Again, that is pretty important in the current situation.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish first of all to thank the Committee on Development and its rapporteur, Mr Hutchinson, for this report which returns to a number of issues and concerns that we completely share.
More and better development aid is necessary if we want to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) by 2015, but also aid that is far more predictable and less volatile, as your report very rightly reminds us.
These efforts will obviously be made using a combination of multiple instruments.
However, from my point of view, in the countries that allow it, budget support, whether general or sectional, remains the best adapted and most appropriate instrument.
Budget support is the best way of strengthening national systems and processes, increasing ownership by the countries, facilitating harmonisation, reducing transaction costs and so improving the management of public expenditure, and accelerating the achievement of development goals.
The Commission has already greatly increased the use of budget support and will do so again over the course of the next six years, within the framework of the tenth European Development Fund (EDF).
It is to make this instrument more effective and more predictable and so the Commission has, in consultation with the Member States and other stakeholders, devised a longer-term form of budget support, which we have called the MDG contract, for countries that meet certain criteria: good past performance, reliable public finance management, appropriate sectional policy, and so on.
The MDG contract is the natural evolution of general budget supports, not just because it is more predictable but above all because it is focused on results and can have a response that is graduated according to performance.
These are partner states that commit to focusing their policies, and consequently their spending, on the MDG.
The MDG contract offers the following key elements: a six-year commitment, that is six full years as opposed to the normal duration of three years for general budget supports; a guaranteed, fixed payment of at least 70% of the total commitments, provided that there is no breach of the conditions in which payments become due or of the essential and fundamental elements of the cooperation; a variable component of up to 60%, intended to reward performance with a view to achieving the MDG and linked to results indicators, mainly in the fields of health and education, as well as progress in public finance management.
Countries are eligible if they have already put budget supports into practice in a satisfactory way as part of the ninth EDF, as well as those that demonstrate a strong commitment to ensuring the monitoring and achievement of the MDG.
This is to improve the budgetary resource management of countries where donors have their own coordination.
After evaluating 10 countries, the Commission awarded MDG contracts in seven of them: Burkina Faso, Ghana, Mali, Mozambique, Rwanda, Uganda, Tanzania and Zambia.
These programmes were presented to and awarded by the Member States last December.
Three contracts have already been signed: Zambia and Rwanda - which I signed personally - as well as Mali.
The others will be finalised in the next few weeks.
Collectively, these seven programmes represent approximately EUR 1.8 billion.
In other words: some 50% of the overall general budget support and some 14% of the tenth EDF's total for national indicative programmes.
It is understood - in fact, your report encourages this - that we will seek to extend this measure to other countries, including non-ACP ones, according to experience gained from these first countries.
Obviously, other approaches will have to be devised for countries that are still not eligible for budget support, but the MDG contract already constitutes an important contribution to improving the effectiveness of aid and the acceleration of progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals.

(FR) Mr President, in December the European Court of Justice handed down a long-awaited judgment that has very worrying implications for the protection of posted workers in Europe.
It sends a negative signal to our citizens, who are concerned about the risks of social dumping.
What does the Court say in this so-called 'Laval' ruling?
It says that the Swedish trade unions were wrong to try to force a Latvian undertaking to sign their collective agreement, in particular with regard to the minimum wage.
Under the 1996 Directive, however, posted workers have to observe a nucleus of mandatory rules for minimum protection in the host Member State.
The Court rules that the Swedish system of collective bargaining was not applicable and that such rules could only be imposed by the law.
The European message is thus no longer clear: on the one hand, the Commission prioritises flexicurity and the system of collective bargaining as a model; on the other hand, the Court of Justice discredits this model.
Parliament and the Council must therefore clarify this issue.
Otherwise, it would be like throwing the Bolkestein Directive out the front door only to allow it to sneak in the back, which would be entirely unacceptable.
<D>
(ES) My first speech in Parliament, in June last year, was on the subject of Iran, in the wake of the latest wave of executions.
At that time, I called for the European Union to bring all the instruments at its disposal to bear in order to protect human rights.
Now we find that the repression is still continuing against the Baha'i religious minority, against homosexuals - and I particularly call for the release of imprisoned homosexuals, who are sentenced to death in some cases - against the opposition - with more than 2 500 of the opposition imprisoned - against press freedom - only this Monday we saw the newspaper Farhang-e-Ashti closed down for publishing a statement by Mr Mousavi, the opposition leader - and against the Kurdish minority.
Iran remains a great challenge on the European agenda, and not merely because of the nuclear threat: the international community is already taking action against this.
The challenge is that Iran possesses a great ability to influence practically all the areas where efforts are being made to find a peaceful and diplomatic solution in the Near East, and also in Iraq and in Afghanistan.
Through its repressive actions, Iran is destroying any opportunity of normalising its foreign relations, so that it can be accepted by the community of nations and play a constructive role in international relations.
That is the situation we socialists desire, but it can only be achieved if Iran meets its international commitments, beginning with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
According to the terms of this covenant, Iran must recognise political parties, trade unions, non-governmental organisations, the right to association, freedom of expression, etc.
The support and solidarity of the European Union, which I now call for on behalf of those who demand more rights and for those repressed by the regime, must not be mistaken for any type of Western interference.
Instead, it represents a wish for Iran to meet the minimum requirements necessary to enable it to negotiate with the rest of the world.
<D>
in writing. - (BG) Continuing to reform the common agricultural policy (CAP) is important for allowing Europe to maintain its leading role in this sector.
This, of course, should not be at the cost of producers or the end consumer.
It is a well-known fact that the European Union has turned from an exporter to an importer of agricultural produce.
This shows that the outcome of today's debate needs to be a balanced one, so that we can be sure that the interests of all citizens have been protected.
I believe that a large proportion of the Commission's proposals are beneficial to farmers in Bulgaria, particularly as mismanagement on the part of the Bulgarian Government in this sector and the abuses committed resulted in the failure to reach the results envisaged in the pre-accession mechanisms.
For this reason in the past few months we have witnessed protests by agricultural producers, mainly dairy and cereal farmers.
As a result, without jeopardising the full liberalisation of the market for dairy produce, it is important to provide security for those regions that are highly dependent on dairy farming for their livelihoods.
In Bulgaria, there are a large number of dairy farmers in alpine and other areas with specific difficulties.
For that reason I support the idea that more funding should be allocated for their development and a specialised fund for milk producers generated.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - I will start with Ignalina, because I have talked about this issue many times.
During the accession negotiations it was agreed by Lithuania and the negotiating parties - the other Member States - that because of safety concerns it should be closed by the end of 2009.
This Treaty is primary law and it is ratified by all Member States.
The Commission is not part of this process.
The Commission is the guardian of the Treaty and its role is really to see that the law is being observed.
Therefore I cannot give you any positive news about any change of position, because the Commission position is decided by the Treaty.
What could be done?
I believe that in the Treaty there are also general provisions for support for Lithuania's transformations in the energy sector - an overall package, if I am not mistaken, of EUR 1.3 billion, and this should address areas that could strengthen the supply of energy resources to Lithuania, by strengthening interconnections, by financing energy efficiency measures, by financing alternative supplies.
So that is the way to go, but, at least in my opinion, there is no way in which the Treaty could be changed, because only an intergovernmental conference and ratification can change a primary law of the European Union.
As for Mochovce, in the Commission's opinion it is actually the same question as for Ignalina - it is not a different approach.
But, for Mochovce, we analysed the situation, and in today's world there are particular requirements for new challenges we face.
We have also seen not only safety but security concerns where aircraft could be used to target nuclear installations.
The technology proposed for the new reactors did not sufficiently address this issue.
That is why we asked the operator, together with the Slovak nuclear energy control authorities, to take some supplementary measures that would guarantee that, even if a nuclear power plant was targeted in this way, it would sustain no permanent damage.
Subject: Investment in first generation, priority for second generation
The Turmes draft report (2008/0016/COD) on the proposal for a Directive on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources, currently making its way through Parliamentary committees, is reconsidering the Council and Commission biofuel and renewable energy mandatory target in transport, because second generation research and development has not attained a breakthrough.
Is it not the case, however, that we should set out a clear regulatory policy for investors in first-generation biofuels?
Why?
These are the very same investors in second- and third-generation research and development who will build plants which can be easily converted to the needs of second- and third-generation technology.
They cannot afford not to invest in R&D for next generation plants, as their plants will become obsolete.
<D>
Madam President, I speak in this debate on the EU-China summit and the EU-China human rights dialogue, although from some of the resolutions tabled by political groups in this House you would not have known that the first half of this debate existed.
It is quite right that we raise with the Chinese the issue of human rights.
The human rights situation in China is far from adequate.
China continues to use the death penalty, as Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner stated in her opening statement.
They repress campaigning organisations for Tibetan autonomy, religious groups outside a very narrow range of officially permitted groups, as well as others who promote their regions, promote press freedom and try and organise trade unions.
We also have the insurmountable barrier with respect to the hundreds of millions of migrant workers in China who try to organise themselves to end exploitation and to promote decent labour standards.
Yet there is a complete refusal on the part of many in this House to acknowledge any of the progress that China has made over the past two decades.
The human rights situation in China in my view, although far from adequate, is far better than it was back in the days of Tiananmen Square.
As the Commissioner stated, the death penalty, for example, now requires confirmation by the Chinese Supreme Court.
My own experience is that in China now there is a large degree of freedom of thought but not freedom to organise, because that still is the sine qua non in terms of what China and the Chinese authorities actually forbid.
We must continue to press China on these issues, but a refusal to recognise any progress positively discourages those progressive and liberal forces within the regime who are trying to push further, because they get no recognition for what they have done already.
China is now a global economic, industrial and political power.
The EU needs to have a critical engagement that rightly criticises China where it has gone wrong, where it must go further, at the same time as we engage in a dialogue on tackling global warming, the negative impacts of globalisation, African development and the fight against terrorism.
<D>
Mr President, there have been long and difficult discussions on this directive in committee, in trialogues and variously in Member States, with the media, with venture capitalists and with fund managers of all types.
Interestingly, the Member States that were most concerned about hedge fund activity were also those that did not have any regulation of hedge fund managers nor conduct-of-business rules to stop the selling to retail investors of some products only appropriate for professional investors.
Similarly, the Member States most worried about asset stripping and hidden takeovers were ones without lower disclosure thresholds on shareholding and without disclosure of contracts for difference.
Now, wherever you are in the EU, there will be protection - and that is right.
In the supervisory architecture, we have taken a big step towards a common rule book.
The lesson of AIFM is that we must also take steps to early sharing of best practice.
So I say to the City, to my own Member State, the UK: be vigilant when promoting the export to Europe of a full range of market regulation with which you already comply.
The end-product may not be exactly the same and therefore you will have to adjust, and I am afraid that does entail some cost.
But sharing this best practice, exporting ideas early, is the way to avoid the trauma of legislation at a late stage.
That said, the end result that we have is an open and reasonably balanced one.
It is not divergent from company law norms.
It is not perfect, and it is certainly not as succinct as I would like but, given all the circumstances, I endorse it as a good result.
I should like to thank personally Minister Reynders and Commissioner Barnier for their very important and active engagement in the trialogues.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - (EL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, over a year has passed since the publication of the Communication from the Commission 'Mobilising public and private finance towards global access to climate-friendly, affordable and secure energy services: the Global Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Fund' (known as GEEREF).
Since then, there have been many developments, such as the Bali Agreement last December.
As a result, this initiative now appears more important and timely.
It is, then, the right moment to debate this report, and I note with satisfaction that the European Parliament is particularly positive about this new and innovative means of supporting energy efficiency and renewable energy projects.
Allow me, first of all, to explain why the Commission has proposed to use public subsidies in the global fund of business risk capital, even though Mr Turmes has already indicated the main points leading us to this decision and has also asked some questions.
In fact, despite the continual progress observed in the utilisation of renewable energy sources, the total worldwide share of energy sources that they represent remains low.
It is also well known that improving energy efficiency can offer greater gains than setting up a new energy infrastructure.
Nevertheless, with the investments being made worldwide in the energy efficiency sector, existing opportunities for improvement are not being fully utilised.
The significant difficulties in finding private funding for energy efficiency and renewable energy projects are thus a major problem.
The reasons are complex and relate mainly to the lack of business risk capital.
Business risk capital is required in developing countries, and in transitional economies it is estimated to amount to more than EUR 9 billion a year.
This is much higher than the amount currently available.
Although public subsidies have been increased in recent years, the total amount available is insufficient.
Additional capital must be found; it is required in the energy sector until 2030.
As a result, the search for private sector funding is vital.
However, the many years required for the repayment of investments in clean technologies hinder investors, especially in geographical regions deemed to be high-risk.
For example, private investments in sub-Saharan Africa are very low; this is precisely why one of the objectives of GEEREF is to encourage investments in these regions.
The amount to which Mr Turmes has referred is indicative, as it is a minimum to be invested in these regions.
A second problem that Mr Turmes has referred to is the scale of projects.
For small-scale projects in remote countries, administrative and execution costs may be higher.
As a result, international funding bodies are not prepared to fund such projects, particularly if their value is below EUR 10 million, as you have said.
This is precisely the aim of GEEREF: to overcome such obstacles in the way of small-scale investments.
We will focus our efforts on projects such as these.
The fund will attract private investors by using public resources to protect them from the risks I referred to earlier.
To enable GEEREF to get up and running, the European Commission will commit approximately EUR 80 million from the current year until 2010.
As you said earlier, with the additional commitments by the governments of Germany and Norway, we have exceeded EUR 100 million.
We expect that additional business risk capital will be drawn from the private sector, amounting to at least EUR 300-500 million, or perhaps as much as EUR 1 billion, in the slightly longer term.
Mr President, I am pleased that in this report the European Parliament is supporting the creation of the Global Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Fund.
I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Turmes, for his efforts, as well as Mr Wijkman and Mrs Korhola from the Committee on Development and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety respectively, for their contributions.
I think that this is an important and timely initiative that demonstrates that the EU is taking action and is determined to help developing countries to gain access to energy efficiency and renewable energy sources.
The fundamental prerequisite for the funding of projects - and not only those connected with biomass or biofuels - will undoubtedly be respect for sustainability criteria, which will not be any less stringent than those laid down in various EU legislation.
This will strengthen the relationship of trust that we need to establish with these countries, especially with a view to the global climate change agreement, which should be concluded by the end of 2009.
(Applause)
<D>
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Madam President, these reports bring the usual wish list of incompatible objectives: security of energy supply, an efficient energy market, reduction of CO2, harmonised rules for all countries and cheap energy for pensioners.
Well, cheap energy for some means that the rest of us pay for it.
Perhaps we think we shall win friends by forcing governments to provide subsidised energy to those suffering from so-called 'energy poverty'.
Is there no area of activity in which the EU will trust national governments to do what they think is best for their own peoples?
One thing that these reports should highlight, but do not, is the foolishness of the targets for carbon and renewable energy.
The oil price is high and likely to remain high, yet the cost of energy to consumers is going to be higher still in order to subsidise renewables.
Ironically, sustained high oil prices are just what is needed to reduce CO2 emissions.
They will reduce consumption and stimulate the development of alternative sources far more effectively than any number of targets and directives.
Who knows?
We may eventually find that wind power becomes viable.
In the end it will be very hard to impose harmonised unbundling rules across 27 Member States, irrespective of the benefits that this may or may not bring.
Countries would indeed be foolish to rely too heavily on their neighbours for energy supplies.
When the lights go out, when hospitals have no power, national interests are going to prevail irrespective of orders from the proposed EU regulator.
That is how things are.
<D>
The humanitarian situation in Gaza is unacceptable.
Eighty-eight percent of the population are in need of food aid, there is a lack of essential medical supplies in the hospitals, and thousands of tons of aid cannot be brought into Gaza because not enough trucks are being allowed in.
People all over the world were horrified at the low level of international response when more than 1 000 Palestinians - including more than 300 children - were killed during the recent Israeli attack on Gaza.
A proactive, long-term strategy from Europe and from the new US Government must include the right of Palestinians to a sustainable state - based on the borders that were there before 1967.
It must stop settlement activities in the Occupied Territories and it must demolish the apartheid wall.
The security of Israel and a free state of Palestine must be achieved, but the situation where Israel is using security as an excuse to destroy the lives of innocent Palestinians must be ended.
A genuine process of negotiation must be begun.
The EU must cancel the Association Agreement between the European Union and Israel while Israel does not comply with international law and humanitarian law.
<D>
Mr President, firstly, let us be clear that this Parliament will today support the UN Security Council Resolution 1860.
It should be implemented without delay.
As one of the MEPs here who has been in Gaza through the blockade, a ceasefire and a withdrawal are not enough.
Of course we want the rockets to stop and the terrorists to stop their movements, but we must see a ceasefire and an end to the blockade so that the people of Gaza can begin to live their lives.
This is an issue of respect for international humanitarian law.
Human Rights Watch and Islamic Relief have told me that the three-hour daily pause is simply woefully inadequate to get in and to distribute aid.
It is an issue of proportionality.
Save the Children say that the killing of 139 children since the conflict began, with 1 271 injured, cannot be justified as self-defence.
I welcome the statement today by the EU envoy in Israel, Ramiro Cibrian-Uzal, who said that the EU and Israel have put negotiations on the upgrading of relations 'on hold' at this time for these reasons.
So they should.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, this has been a very interesting discussion.
Let me say that very often we hear the question: how can we bring the citizen nearer to the European Union?
This is one example of how we can make the citizen feel that the European Union is doing something for him or her.
Under the present system, there are many inequalities.
With the clear legal framework provided by the draft directive concerning citizens and the various issues we are trying to give clear information to the citizen about their rights and how they can exercise them.
It is true that there are concerns.
I listened very carefully to your concerns, and I am sure that during the course of the debate and the deliberations we shall have, we have to address these concerns so that the end result will be something which is really of benefit to the citizen.
This is not a Bolkestein Directive II - far from it - and we should never think that this is so.
It is about patients' rights and how to exercise those rights.
We are not trying to harmonise health systems.
Member States can continue to exercise and regulate their health systems, and they can decide for themselves what benefits they want to offer to their citizens, and to what extent.
We are not trying to encourage health tourism.
We are not trying to give citizens the chance to have their faces and their bodies fixed; rather, we are trying to give citizens the right to have proper health care when they are sick and they need it.
Nor do we expect a big exodus of European citizens from their home state to another Member State.
According to the calculations and to the impact assessment that we have, only a very small percentage of citizens wish to go abroad.
Why?
Because they want to have the care that they need nearer to their families, they want to speak their own language and to be in a familiar environment.
However, there are cases when they need some extra health care which their home state cannot provide.
This is a right that we give them - this extra right to have an informed choice and decide for themselves where they go for their health treatment.
Indeed, we have had encouragement from the European Court of Justice to legislate.
We cannot leave it all the time to the Court to decide about the rights of the patient case by case.
This is not just.
How many European citizens can afford a lawyer and can afford to go to court?
Only a very few.
Therefore, we must offer solutions to all the patients, give them the right information and let them decide for themselves what they need.
This is a time for all of us to work together - the Council, the Commission and Members of Parliament - to find the best possible solutions for patients.
(Applause)
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (EL) Madam President, freedom, security and justice are three words we keep hearing in the EU.
They are the three components of the Hague Programme that, in combination and individually, were invoked to serve all the Member States of the Union.
The principle of mutual recognition and enforcement of court judgments, which eight years ago, in 1999, was described by the European Council in Tampere as the cornerstone of judicial cooperation, is making no progress.
The few steps needed to implement this principle are being taken very slowly.
Mr Varvitsiotis has correctly identified and dealt with the root cause of the problem: the individual, nationalist positions held by various states.
The Council Framework Decision on the recognition and enforcement of judgments in criminal matters involving deprivation of liberty issued in other EU Member States is the subject of Mr Varvitsiotis' report.
The decision proves how slow and sporadic the action has been in creating an area of freedom, security and justice because this decision is only one of many measures that should have already been taken, and because it took such a long time to prepare.
In any case, we welcome the completion of the deliberation procedure and the adoption of a common position on the issue of recognising court judgments in criminal matters.
Mr Varvitsiotis deserves praise for his contribution to the favourable outcome of the proposal, which we have adopted and shall be voting in favour of.
The recognition and supervision of suspended sentences, alternative sanctions and conditional sentences, the subject of Mrs Esteves' report, is certainly another step among the many that must be taken to implement the principle of mutual recognition and enforcement of court judgments.
The Franco-German proposal seeks to reintegrate sentenced persons into society.
It proposes to allow them to serve, in their Member State of residence, suspended sentences, alternative sanctions and conditional sentences imposed by the courts of other Member States.
The rapporteur has done excellent work and I congratulate her.
However, I believe the definition given for 'lawful and ordinary residence' is incorrect.
Furthermore, the use of the word 'unacceptable' for violation of human rights is unnecessary, because there are no acceptable violations.
I understand, however, that there is a problem in the translation of these two terms, and I therefore call on Mrs Esteves to make the necessary verbal amendments so that the text can be rendered correctly in all languages.
<D>
(PL) Mr President, the common energy policy is currently one of the greatest challenges facing the European Union.
Our response to it must be based on solidarity.
We are all aware that Russia remains one of our most important and also most difficult trading partners.
The fact that Russia is our main source of gas supply cannot, however, be allowed to mean that it can receive special treatment.
The rapporteur suggests relaxing the Union's policy towards the Russian Federation.
I believe that we must pursue a fair but strict policy towards a trading partner that uses the raw materials of energy as a weapon with which to exert political pressure.
It is emphasised that diversification of energy sources is one of the fundamental issues arising in the area of energy security.
One way of tackling this would be to free ourselves from dependency on Russian raw materials.
The construction of the Nabucco pipeline and the exploitation of other sources of energy are steps in this direction.
<D>
(PL) There has been talk here of the need for youth and cultural exchange between the Union and Belarus.
I am afraid this will be very difficult.
On 3 December, Tatiana Szapućko, spokesperson for the opposition organisation Young Front, had her name struck off the list of students at the Faculty of Law of the Belarusian State University.
Why was her name removed?
For taking part in a forum on the Eastern Partnership in Brussels.
The university authorities took the view that she had left without their consent, and for this she was thrown out of the university.
Perhaps for a woman in Belarus, this is not all that dangerous, but for men thrown out of university in Belarus, the results can be much more painful, because military service there is treated as a punishment, as a substitute for prison.
There are young soldiers, such as Franek Wieczorka, head of the youth organisation called the Belarusian Youth Front, and Ivan Szyła, also from the organisation Young Front, who are being persecuted during military service, where they are cut off from access to information, and this is treated as a punishment.
We should fight against this and should support those who are punished in this way.
<D>
(PT) This summit took place because the Portuguese Presidency insisted and the African Union took a gamble.
Those in Europe who wanted to diminish the summit on the pretext of Robert Mugabe's presence in Lisbon have lost.
Yet those who receive the King of Saudi Arabia in London with all due pomp and circumstance have no place to talk about human rights.
At the same time as the summit, numerous civic actions denounced this duplicity of words and deeds, the duplicity of those who were missing but also of those who were there.
In Portugal, the summit allowed people to talk about Africa and its problems and only for this reason was it worth the effort.
However, those who have listened to the Presidency and the Commission will believe that this was a genuinely historic event, a moment with a before and an after, which is clearly an exaggeration.
In fact, for the Portuguese, this was a kind of Luso-tropicalist provincialism, as apparent from the European press.
Progress was made: in fact, the main element of progress was that the African countries drew up their own agenda.
However, in all other respects, there was a gaping hole between the vanity of the words and the meagreness of the results.
This summit was better than the Cairo Summit, but that was hardly difficult!
What is difficult is to accept joint responsibility when starting from the fixed idea of economic partnership agreements.
<D>
Madam President, honourable Members, I am honoured to take part in this debate to commemorate the great famine of 1932 and 1933, which was one of the great tragedies of the 20th century.
After many years of silence, testimonies of the suffering call for our attention, together with the accounts of many survivors who found themselves caught up in that terrible event.
It is vital that the experience of the Holodomor is not forgotten.
The story of the great famine illustrates not only the tragedy of the Ukrainian people, but also reminds us again of what human beings are capable of.
The Holodomor has something important to teach us, however: the sacrifice of so many has not been in vain.
Their sacrifice reminds us never to accept that any state should subjugate individuals, whatever the cause or purpose for what takes place.
That disastrous famine has shown the superiority of a constitutional state over one in which no form of dissent is permitted.
Tragedies like the Holodomor only happen in those human societies that violate the rights of citizens, the rule of law and democratic principles.
The European Union rose from the ashes of war and numerous totalitarian regimes, those dictatorships that deeply scarred the history of Europe and of the whole world.
Out of those same tragedies and catastrophes, however, sprung forth the democracies of Europe and, in the last fifty years, a season of peace has been built on those ruins, a peace that we have a duty to defend, and to carry beyond the borders of the Union: fifty years of peace that have been the greatest achievement of a united Europe.
Today, Ukraine has also changed.
As an independent country, a member of the Council of Europe and signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights, as well as many other international instruments for the safeguard of these fundamental rights, Ukraine has an extraordinary opportunity to consolidate itself, to bolster its position as a democratic state that respects human rights and the rule of law.
It is certainly an ambitious and difficult task.
We have witnessed many troubles; many political battles have marked recent years in the history of this country, which has become stronger in its democracy.
At this historic time, we must all lend our political support and encouragement to the independence of the judiciary.
It is important that Ukraine continues to fight corruption and to take account of the results of the recent elections so that democratic principles are complied with.
Nor must it omit to safeguard the most weak and marginalised, whatever their race, ethnicity or religion, or indeed their sexual orientation or state of health.
The European Union will continue to support Ukraine in these important efforts.
At the same time, we will continue to work together with our Ukrainian partners to raise the prosperity of all the citizens of that nation, by opening new markets and increasing the prospects for economic activity and investment, in addition to deepening relationships between our citizens.
I would like to add, as Commissioner for Transport, that as regards trans-European networks, we should remember that these can serve not only to strengthen our internal market, but also as a tool to extend the frontiers of Europe, to open Europe up to new horizons and to strengthen links with near and friendly countries which border the European Union, like Ukraine.
For the victims of the Holodomor there can be no better tribute than the creation of a prosperous, stable and democratic Ukraine, founded on solid institutions and on an engaged civil society.
Only if this goal is reached will the sacrifice of so many innocent victims not have been in vain.
<D>
in writing. - (FR) Faced with rising crime and threats to its security, the European Union must set itself two key objectives.
The first objective consists of stepping up the fight against terrorism, which transcends borders and knows no limits in terms of violence and the threat it represents.
The second objective remains the protection of fundamental rights on which Europe is built.
The adoption by all Member States of the Prüm Treaty proposed in 2007 by Germany forms part of the much needed improvement of police cooperation within the EU.
The exchange of DNA profiles and valuable information, such as fingerprints and vehicle number-plates, between different national systems has already helped to solve numerous investigations.
From the fight against abductions to international terrorism, not to mention the organisation of transnational events, these measures are essential.
However, European policy must combat crime, rather than build a system that will undermine the rule of law and destabilise democracy.
The accessibility and use of personal data must be governed by European laws, which we can only hope will be adopted swiftly.
This report is a good illustration of the importance of the balance between data use and protection.
<D>
Vice-President of the Commission. - I can say that Plan D played a key role in testing new methods for civil society organisations to involve citizens from all walks of life in debates on the future of Europe.
It gave us examples of consultation that we never had before, inviting randomly-chosen citizens from all Member States to sit down together and discuss the European Union's agenda.
It was indeed a very exciting experience.
One of the key lessons from this experience was that we need to strengthen the interface between citizens and EU decision-makers because, if we promise to listen better, what do we do with what we hear?
This is what they want to know.
We decided to prolong Plan D in the period leading up to the European parliamentary elections in June next year.
This new phase is called 'Debate Europe'.
We have allocated EUR 7.2 million to Debate Europe, EUR 2 million of which to cofinance transnational projects and EUR 5.2 million to cofinance decentralised calls and actions supporting local projects administered by the representations.
We do not decide in advance how much money is available per Member State or which beneficiaries will run these pan-European consultation projects.
This depends on the results of the calls for proposals which the Commission is presently launching, both centrally and via our representations.
We think that Debate Europe should also provide an effective framework for interinstitutional cooperation.
One model was the concluding conference that was held on the first phase of Plan D last December.
Here not only the Parliament, the Commission, but also the Committee of the Regions and the European Economic and Social Committee were involved.
I think it proved complementary in addressing the specific citizens' concerns and that this kind of cooperation should become the rule in the framework of Debate Europe, also at national or regional level.
We also hope that we can engage Members of the European Parliament much more in these local and regional activities.
I have just informed this group - the so-called 'IGI' - about the request from this Parliament to engage in a pilot information network.
We have prepared and will present to the European Parliament the outcome of our project very soon: preparing for such a network, joining national and European parliamentarians and we hope also inviting journalists to take part in the debate on European issues.
I have already mentioned the public spheres, the European public spaces, in the pilot project.
Along these lines we can continue Plan D, learn from the experience so far and engage with citizens on a number of projects and models that we hopefully can establish permanently - not only as something that runs for six months or so - and ensure that we can involve decision-makers with European citizens in these ways.

in writing. - (FR) The CAP 'Health Check' established by the Commission is not a health check at all: it is an unconfessed new reform.
It is also another step towards the economic reorganisation of the world on which Brussels's Europe has been working for years in Washington's footsteps: in southern countries and the United States, agriculture; in the north, services and industry, amid fierce competition from emerging nations.
European agriculture is simply sacrificed, and will soon be handed over to market forces alone; a rigged market, too, for it has been left defenceless against imports and denied access to export markets.
Agriculture is not a sector like any other.
Since it feeds human beings, it is a matter of national independence and sovereignty.
The quality of foodstuffs affects public health.
Working the land affects land-use planning, protection of the environment, biodiversity, management of water resources, organisation and population of rural areas... but it is still a productive activity.
Dispensing with all proactive agricultural policies is worse than a crime: it is a huge mistake.
It is a great pity that, apart from a few positive elements, the rapporteur did not question this logic.
<D>
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, it is crucial to solve the current legislative gap concerning the financing of non-ODA actions in countries covered by the DCI.
This proposal for an instrument to address this gap must preserve the DCI unequivocally as an instrument for ODA and it must allow for a clear separation between financial sources allocated to pure ODA development cooperation and those allocated to other types of non-ODA development cooperation with developing countries.
This separation is a very relevant political message in itself and it would give proper visibility to the EU's development cooperation policy.
The new or revised instrument should also be sufficiently broad to cover a wide range of actions that do not comply with the OECD DAC guidelines, but which are crucial for the EU's cooperation with developing countries, for instance, the development of the Akkas gas fields in Iraq or cooperation on aviation security with India.
This is why I am not in full agreement with the restrictive legal basis proposed.
I fully back Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner in finding Article 181a, possibly, a more adequate legal basis, which would provide for these kinds of concerns that I am highlighting.
However, I am not convinced either by the alternative presented by the PPE-DE Group amendment that we are supposed to vote on tomorrow.
Therefore, I hope that, under the guidance of our rapporteur, Thijs Berman, we may find more time to have a thorough discussion on this matter and consider what is the best legal basis, namely, the proposal made by Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner.
<D>
author. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our debate today is particularly important, as we know, for two reasons: firstly, because we are talking about one of the substances that has caused most harm and deaths among citizens and workers at the plants where it is used and produced, namely asbestos.
Secondly, because we are debating one of the first measures to implement the extremely significant regulation that has, in a way, marked this parliamentary term, that is to say REACH.
With the question we have asked and the draft resolution we will vote on today - let me say straight away to reassure the Commission and Vice-President Tajani who is here on its behalf - we are not opposing the draft implementing regulation that the Commission has adopted on this issue.
I refer to Point 2.6 of this draft measure, which provides the missing Annex 17 that should have reproduced the provisions of Annex 1 of Directive 76 - the directive on dangerous substances, which will be replaced by REACH, and therefore repealed - this Point 2.6 extends the ban on the placing on the market of asbestos fibres and products containing asbestos.
The truth is that in this same decision, however, there are exemptions, to be granted by certain Member States - for the record, there are four of them - who may keep articles marketed before 2005 on the market, as well as diaphragms containing chrysotile asbestos used in production at existing electrolysis plants.
The possibility of using these exemptions is of course subject to the Member States' compliance with all the Community rules on worker protection, effectively meaning that these plants, coming to the end of their lifecycle, do not generate problems for workers' health.
There is a reason why we are not opposed to this: these exemptions do exist, but we must acknowledge that the Commission has provided a mechanism, so to speak, by which these exemptions will in time - in 2012, to be exact - be reviewed through reports to be made by the Member States concerned, on the basis of which the European Chemicals Agency will prepare a dossier providing for the gradual withdrawal of the exemptions.
Thus we are not opposed, but certainly with our resolution we want to give you in the Commission a strong impetus to be a bit bolder, to go a bit further and a bit faster, shall we say, above all bearing in mind that there are already alternatives to chrysotile asbestos, at least for high-voltage plants, and in fact the companies concerned have launched promising research programmes to find alternatives for low-voltage plants also.
There are two aims to our stimulus and our input.
The first is to set ourselves a date, a deadline - we are proposing 2015 - by which to lift these exemptions, launching a real withdrawal strategy, including measures that will then be required to demolish these plants in safety and also ensure safety as regards export.
Lastly, the second thing we are asking the Commission - and we would appreciate a reply on this, too - concerns a point that is critical for us, namely the fact that a Community list of articles containing asbestos for which an exemption applies has not yet been adopted, and so we are of course asking for this as soon as possible, by 2012, to enable better control and a better understanding.
<D>
Mr President, I understand the displeasure felt by some Members here that our resolution on China was actually scheduled for a date after the visit by the Chinese delegation and hence might, by chance, give an impression of an unsuccessful journey, although the atmosphere was, in fact, excellent.
It is everyone's desire that cooperation continues in a positive spirit, without, however, forgetting the facts.
Diplomacy cannot ignore human rights, but we need diplomacy and awareness of the situation to promote them.
Only recently, I was on a visit to Pakistan, where I met the President, the Prime Minister and prominent ministers to discuss human rights and the fight against terrorism.
I would say that sometimes in our resolutions on human rights, we also need to mention the good news.
There is cause for that now.
A year ago, Pakistan's new democratically elected government appointed the first Minister for Minorities, who himself represents the Christian minority.
The government's achievements in this area have been significant: the country has approved a 5% quota of public offices reserved for minorities, religious festivals for minorities have been made official, minorities are to have their own special day of celebration on 11 August, and the Senate is planning the same 5% quota for that institution.
The most important project relates to the reduction in incidences of violence.
Minorities together with Muslims are forming local 'inter-faith harmony' committees, whose purpose it will be to soothe tensions and improve dialogue between the various groups.
There will be one in 112 local areas.
Ideally, they will also be able to prevent recruitment by the Taliban very effectively.
Pakistan is the most crucial country in terms of global security.
If the government succeeds in eliminating terrorism by such peaceful means as these, the example will be worth following.
The situation should be interesting to watch.
<D>
Mr Evans, you had one minute to speak, not two.
We take note of the idea put to us by the ever witty Mr Evans.
Anyway, before suspending the sitting, I would like to share with you and the Commissioner the good news that, a few hours ago, the House of Lords of such an important country as the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, ratified the Treaty of Lisbon.
I imagine that Queen Elizabeth is in the process of signing the relevant document, so that the United Kingdom, with this measure, ratifies the Treaty of Lisbon.
I think we are all happy about this news, including those who are not present, even if they leave their flag on their seat and are not usually present in the Chamber when there is work to do.
With this happy news, we end this debate.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
(The sitting was suspended at 11.30 a.m. and resumed at 12 noon)
<D>
in writing. - (FI) Madam President, first I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for what I see as the proper line of reasoning: the interests of the environment should be given high priority in both good and bad times.
Your answers to Mr Wurtz, Mr Cohn-Bendit and Mr Schultz were likewise pertinent.
I wish to express my concern in particular about the fate of emissions trading.
When you consider what has been done in this House this autumn, Parliament's position cannot be regarded as the outcome of a democratic process.
It smacks of undue haste, and the committees did not know what they were voting on.
The amendments that have been tabled are a kind of bluff and we have been manipulated and misled.
Our rapporteur and our group coordinator betrayed everyone by not going with decision the group voted on.
Parliament has never seen anything like it before.
The Commission is one guilty party.
It delivered a huge package of legislation too late and then warned against touching it in the name of international harmony with regard to the climate issue.
The result is a poor model for emissions trading, which, if realised, will push up costs and threaten European jobs.
Any auction applied unilaterally is just an extra tax burden.
I cannot see any benefit to the environment if European products, the world's most cleanly manufactured, should acquire this burden in the name of the fight against climate change.
An auction simply takes pollution away from Europe, dumps it somewhere else, and brings us unemployment.
It is neither a good nor a responsible environmental policy.
We need a more effective climate policy.
Emissions have to be cut according to the commitments we have made.
Our alternative also deserves to be properly considered in Parliament.
Many of the Member States are in favour of it, as are the Confederation of European Industries and the entire European trade union movement.
Another reading would eliminate the democratic deficit that has now been established in the House.
<D>
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the PSE Group has just adopted an important contribution on revision of the internal market.
I shall be pleased to let Commissioner McCreevy have a copy later on.
We see the internal market as the greatest economic achievement of the Union, together with the euro, but, unlike the Commissioner, we are not market fanatics.
The market has been the natural place for trade between human beings since they moved on from the gatherer stage.
The market is useful, it even has its virtues, but it is not in itself a model for society.
The market economy is fine, as long as we do not end up with a society where everything is for sale, where human needs like education, culture, social welfare and health are entirely dependent on market forces.
What we are advocating is a social market economy in which the necessary competition is still subject to rules, consumers are protected and efficient public services make up for the shortcomings of the market.
In the United States, the health sector accounts for over 15% of GDP, twice the European average, but 44 million American workers do not have health insurance.
To avoid two-speed healthcare in Europe, we would like to see European support for health services.
We urge the Commission finally to comply with the request by the European Councils in Nice, Laeken and Barcelona and to put forward proposals for a Community framework allowing national, regional and local authorities to offer efficient public services with full legal certainty.
We ask the Commission to work to achieve a high level of social protection within the internal market.
Any legislation aimed at completing the single market should be coupled with a study of its impact on employment in the sector concerned.
We want safeguard clauses like the Monti clause, protecting the right to strike and collective agreements.
In our view, maintaining a high degree of social protection requires ambitious directives on working hours and temporary work arrangements.
Social protection is not incompatible with economic efficiency.
Indeed it is the States with the best-organised social dialogue, such as the Scandinavian countries, Germany, the Netherlands and a few others, that have the most successful economies in the European Union.
In short, the PSE Group is in favour of competition that stimulates, cooperation that strengthens and solidarity that unites.
I have just quoted Jacques Delors.
I shall leave it to my colleague, Evelyne Gebhardt, to comment on the Toubon report, which I think I can say is generally positive.
(Applause)
<D>
Mr President, the negotiations in Bali on climate change were a success, but we have to think further.
It was a successful first step on the road to Copenhagen.
The participants from the European Union's different branches did a very good job and the Portuguese Presidency held it together in a very good way.
But I would like to focus on the question marks and the problems we face, and this mainly concerns a couple of topics.
Firstly, the roadmap.
We have to keep track of every meeting on the road to Copenhagen.
We have to do it in cooperation and fully realising the measures or the tools of the new Treaty, and do it because there will be codecision on these issues in the future.
That means other working methods and more cooperation between the Commission, the Council and Parliament, and I look forward to this.
Let me now turn to the problems.
We have to engage with the G77 Group on forestry, the combination of technology transfer and the fight against poverty and climate change.
This could be better prepared than in Bali, and it is absolutely necessary to do this.
I have here in my hands the full Commission Lisbon Strategic Package.
It is not only the Lisbon Treaty but also the Lisbon Process that we have to merge together and with the work of climate change.
I think there is still much to prove if we are to talk the talk and walk the walk and fulfil the promises Europe made in Bali.
<D>
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (BG) Mr President, Europe is currently faced with a comparatively new but very serious danger of lagging behind or even of a decline in terms of global competition in the field of science and technology.
Such a development would put our prosperity, economic progress and social status under serious pressure.
Put in simpler terms, Europe is under threat of turning into a mediocre actor on the global scientific and economic stage.
Europe urgently needs innovation now.
I congratulate Mrs Merkies on her fine report.
I am also delighted with the excellent ideas from Commissioner Geoghegan-Quinn.
This guarantees success because the Innovation Union is primarily a strategy for the European Union's economic development.
We require the following for us to succeed in this.
Firstly, we need to have better access to credit and financial support; we need more investment in scientific research and development; clear rules offering long-term prospects in terms of innovation; simplified procedures for accessing European and national support programmes; and cheap, simple European patents.
<D>
The anchovy fishery in the Bay of Biscay is of considerable social and economic importance.
This fishery has been closed since 2005, and the fleet has declined from 391 vessels in 2005 to 239 vessels in 2009, directly affecting more than 2 500 families.
This closure has caused serious damage to the groups concerned (fishermen, net menders, the canning industry, etc.).
The loss of income has not been covered by the compensatory aid granted by the Member States.
The introduction of this plan will make it possible to remove the management of anchovy from the political negotiation in December of each year, placing it on course to achieve the objectives for the management of European resources in the long term, thereby guaranteeing sustainability and maximum yield.
The exploitation rule defines the TAC (or total allowable catch) in the fishery for each year (from July to June of the following year), immediately after the assessment of the stock in line with the fishing seasons in May of each year, thus immediately making maximum use of this information.
All the productive and local businesses involved await the reopening of this fishery and have made a significant contribution to drafting the paper.
For these reasons, I am minded to vote in favour of the provision as a whole.
<D>
Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, addressing radicalisation into violence is at the core of the Commission's counter-terrorism policy, and I therefore welcome the report being discussed today and the very vital issues it tackles.
I also welcome the progress in interinstitutional cooperation in the area of recognition of the enormous challenge we face in developing a coherent EU policy that prevents, interrupts or reverses radicalisation processes.
After a series of initiatives in recent years, since my first communication on the subject in September 2005, a communication will be presented to the Council and Parliament in July this year, identifying good practices in the Member States and making concrete recommendations for the way forward.
I notice that the report makes a recommendation to the Commission in this regard.
We have devoted time and resources in the last three years to better understanding this phenomenon, its trends, its manifestations and its dynamics.
We have commissioned four separate comparative studies which are now being completed.
We have sent a questionnaire to all the Member States and are currently analysing the answers received.
We have organised a conference on the role of education in preventing radicalisation, which brought together educators, religious leaders and policy-makers to brainstorm new ideas.
We are working on drafting the communication at the moment.
The first three studies - on trigger factors, narrative and mobilisation tactics - are to be approved in the coming month.
A fourth study on civil society engagement (best practices) is likely to be published around the time of the communication's adoption in July.
Its main results will by that stage already have been incorporated into the communication.
Analysis of the questionnaire sent to the Member States is ongoing and will also feed into the reflection on the communication.
We can therefore now formulate our policy with much deeper insight into the problem.
Our communication will deal with important issues like the narrative used by violent radicals and radicalisation in prisons and in other places of vulnerability.
We will also be talking about the role of education, and civil society engagement in countering radicalisation.
Members will be aware that, in relation to incitement, we have presented a proposal for the amendment of the Framework Decision on combating terrorism that is one part of the 'terrorism package' introduced last November.
That instrument aims to introduce into the Framework Decision offences parallel to those covered in the Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism: public provocation, recruitment and training for terrorism - including via the internet - and in particular internet instructions on how to produce home-made bombs.
The Commission is strongly committed to supporting the victims of terrorism.
We have, since 2004, demonstrated our support through financial assistance to numerous projects intended to help associations of victims of terrorism and to promote solidarity among European citizens.
We envisage creating, in 2008, a European Network of Associations of Victims of Terrorism, in order to represent victims' interests at European level and to strengthen European citizens' solidarity with victims of terrorism.
In conclusion, in order to tackle the terrorist threat at European level, it is absolutely necessary to implement a global prevention policy on the factors leading to radicalisation and recruitment, in order to explore its deep roots, while never justifying terrorist behaviour.
Jihadist terrorism remains the biggest threat to democratic societies, including thousands of millions of honest Muslim people in the EU and in many other parts of the world.
<D>
rapporteur. - (LT) Today, as the European Union's economy experiences a period of recession, it is very important to stimulate economic growth.
One of the sources of the European Union's economic growth is the expansion of the common market, which is still very fragmented, especially in the area of financial services.
The proposal before us should help solve this problem and establish a common European payment area.
In English this is called the Single Euro Payments Area.
This document already has some history.
As soon as the euro was introduced and the currency exchange rates were abolished in euro zone countries, it became clear that prices for cross-border payments still differed from prices for local payments.
For this reason Regulation (EC) No 2560 of the European Parliament and of the Council on cross-border payments in euro was adopted and entered into force at the end of 2001.
It set equal charges for corresponding local, national payments and cross-border payments and strengthened this principle.
The aim of this was to reduce prices for consumers and ensure greater competition in the payment services market.
Implementing this regulation reduced payment fees; for example, a cross-border transfer of EUR 100 used to cost an average of EUR 24 in the European Union, now it costs EUR 2.50.
On the other hand, the document revealed certain deficiencies.
For this reason it was decided that it should be revised.
The document before us is an improved version of Regulation No 2560.
What is new in the document?
Firstly, the principle of equality of charges for cross-border and corresponding domestic payments has been extended to include direct debit.
This was not previously available.
Once the SEPA had been created and the Payment Services Directive had been adopted, the payment environment in Europe changed; therefore, it is important that from November 2009 it will be possible to use the popular electronic payment method, direct debit, on a cross-border basis.
In order to help create that common direct debit model, the regulation states that in the absence of a bilateral agreement between the payment service providers of the payer and the payee, the level of the default interim Multilateral Interchange Fee for a direct debit will be set at EUR 0.08 for a transitional period until 2012.
The document also outlines how to improve the defence of consumer rights and remove obstacles to business.
It is proposed that Member States appoint competent authorities to supervise the implementation of this regulation, and those authorities should also actively cooperate across nations, so that there are fewer obstacles to business; they could also lay down guidelines on how to assess procedures for determining compliance with the principle.
Another novelty the revision of this document offers is the proposal to gradually abolish obligations imposed on banks in certain states to provide balance-of-payments statistics and the laying down of other procedures for providing balance-of-payments statistics.
I am very sorry that an agreement with the Council could not be reached on this point and for the time being the balance-of-payments revision procedures and implementation procedures have still to be defined.
Parliament and the Commission have declared that a strict deadline would be set.
<D>
(RO) The Union's economic development and competitiveness depend on efficient transport of goods.
We have to develop the railway infrastructure, the maritime corridors, the ports infrastructure and co-modality.
Improving the connections between seaports and river ports and the inland railway and road network is an important component of the logistic infrastructure.
Romania's and Bulgaria's accession provides the European Union with an exit to the Black Sea.
The Danube is now almost entirely a waterway inside the Union.
This means new opportunities for the European transport of goods.
Nevertheless, I emphasize that the efficient transport of goods needs: balanced use of all types of transport, decongesting traffic, simplifying procedures, legislative stability, investments in logistics systems and intelligent transport systems, such as Galileo, but especially ensuring transportation safety.
Programmes such as Naiades and Marco Polo are not sufficiently used by Member States in order to improve the transport of goods.
Nevertheless, I call the Commission's attention to the barriers met by some road carriers, and I refer to the Romanian ones, when transiting the territory of certain Member States.
<D>
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very grateful indeed for the various contributions to this debate.
I think almost all the contributions have made one thing clear: we have the will to roll back bureaucracy, and we have the will to ease the burden on small and medium-sized companies in Europe when it comes to implementing the HACCP rules.
Now it is up to us to express this will by voting in favour of the right amendments, and that means Amendment 10, which we have agreed with the Commission and representatives of the Council presidency.
This amendment states in clear and unequivocal terms what we want to achieve.
In this way, we can proceed in a very straightforward manner, building on the Regulations adopted in 2006.
We want to equip the authorities and, indeed, the food companies with a procedure which enables them to react quickly.
As I pointed out in my speech earlier today, the difficulties will arise in relation to the licensing of companies up to 2009.
We need to send a clear message here.
We want to roll back bureaucracy and we want to maintain hygiene standards.
They are not diluted by this proposal.
I think that is the message which conveys what Parliament wants.
<D>
in writing. - (HU) Mr President, Council, Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the consequence of developing globalisation is that more and more countries become democratic and switch on to free global trade.
As such, it shows the success of Europe's half-century policy of peace and democracy.
On the other hand, the fact that some countries sometimes gain an advantage in international trade by using illegal instruments is a sign that the switch-over to constitutionality is gradual and is not perfect immediately.
It is for precisely this reason that Europe's goal should continue to be the promotion and reinforcement of democracy.
How successful we will be in the global competition arising from this depends on us.
As the author of the Parliament's report on globalisation, I know that we have recognised the challenges, and it is time for action.
We must think about the fact that the prosperity we have today should remain for our grandchildren, and in such a way that in the meantime the other peoples of the world should develop in this way.
Will they have energy?
Will they have an inhabitable environment?
This is what the European energy policy and the building of a 'low-carbon' economy are about.
We must ensure that every person in Europe, irrespective of their origin and situation, and every business, irrespective of their size and registered office, can develop all their talents and their best abilities.
This is what equal opportunities, the building of a knowledge-based society, innovation policy and the new European SME policy are about.
We must switch over to the digital age, for which we must implement e-inclusion in all areas and for everyone.
In short, we have all the tools ready; we just have to do it.
Let us get to work!
<D>
Member of the Commission. - (FR) Madam President, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, I want to salute Parliament's work on the proposal to recast the regulation establishing the European Training Foundation and, in particular, thank the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and its rapporteur, Mr Lehideux.
As you know, the European Training Foundation was created in 1990 to support implementation of the PHARE external assistance programme in the field of vocational training.
Currently its scope covers the countries of the previous TACIS, CARDS and MEDA programmes.
The European Union's policies in the education & training and external relations fields have developed and the ETF regulation therefore needs to be updated to take account of those developments.
The result is the Commission proposal on which you have been working.
Our proposal does not provide for any new ETF activities.
Rather, its aim is to define its tasks more clearly on the basis of a broader thematic remit that includes the concept of human resources development, particularly education and training with a view to lifelong learning.
The proposal also expands the Foundation's geographical scope in line with the EU's new external relations instruments.
In that new context, the ETF's tasks therefore need to be adjusted, while remaining guided by the clearly established priorities.
I am grateful to the European Parliament for addressing the Commission proposal in a positive manner.
Thanks to good cooperation between the three institutions, we have managed to find solutions that satisfy all three of them, including on such sensitive issues as the composition of the Governing Board and the way in which the European Parliament can contribute its specific expertise.
The Commission therefore accepts without hesitation the consolidated text resulting from last week's constructive trilogue.
Let me conclude, on behalf of my colleague Jan Figel, by stressing how important it is for our cooperation to be successful, since that will allow the European Training Foundation to benefit from its new legal basis in due time and therefore provide more effective assistance to the beneficiary countries, which is, after all, obviously the purpose of this exercise.
<D>
(CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to comment on two points in Mrs Thomsen's report.
Right at the start the report states that: a) 'conventional energy resources are about to run out'; b) 'we are experiencing an increasing dependency on imports' of raw energy materials; and c) 'climatic changes ... will have dreadful consequences for the inhabitants'.
The first point I want to make is that the increasing dependency of EU countries on imports of raw energy materials is the only unambiguous fact, about which there is no doubt.
This is indeed a serious political problem.
However, it cannot be solved by giving unilateral preference to so-called renewable energy resources.
The solution must be far more complex.
That is why I want to stress some aspects that are, in my opinion, missing from the report in question.
Firstly, the individual Member States are responsible for their own energy policy and the corresponding right to have their own energy mix.
Secondly, there is nothing in the report to emphasise that economical spending of the limited funds at our disposal is a necessity, and I stress the word 'economical' when talking about spending such funds.
I also consider it necessary for the European Union to cooperate with the US, including coordination of their policies towards countries that export raw energy materials.
Finally, the report makes no mention of the importance of nuclear energy.
My second point is that the predictions on which the report is based, i.e. that conventional energy resources will soon be exhausted and that climate change will have a dreadful impact on the human race, are debatable.
We should not treat them as incontrovertible facts.
<D>
in writing. - Exploiting children in any way is unacceptable.
Being the future of any society, children are, at the same time, the most vulnerable group of it.
Therefore it is the priority duty of politicians to protect children from any abuse, in particular, to free them of the risks of sexual abuse.
I warmly welcome the comprehensive report which calls upon all Member States to address the problem in question with utmost seriousness.
I support the call to the seven Member States which have not yet signed the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse.
Furthermore, I join the call upon all Member States to sign, ratify and implement all relevant international conventions to protect our children.
Nevertheless, signing and ratifying conventions is merely providing a framework for improvement.
Practical actions are needed because of the increasing evidence of sexual exploitation of children.
Children need to grow up in a safe environment for which parents have the primary responsibility.
Urging the Member States to coordinate their actions, I also support the idea to set up the Missing Child Alert System which would improve the cooperation on this issue on the European level.
<D>
(RO) On the subject of the geological storage of carbon dioxide, we are discussing the possibility of testing this new technology during an initial phase.
The Commission intends to implement 12 pilot projects during an initial phase.
The Council has proposed allocating 300 000 000 emission allowances to finance the demonstration projects.
Parliament has called for a reduction in the risk to the environment and human health caused by using this new technology, for a stringent legal framework to be established for testing and promoting projects involving the geological storage of carbon dioxide, and for the provision of the financing for the demonstration projects.
I believe that the safety of these storage sites is extremely important.
However, the level of safety when transporting the carbon dioxide to these sites is just as important.
The competent authorities in every Member State need to implement emergency evacuation plans if a carbon dioxide leak occurs.
In addition, special measures need to be adopted and financed when such sites are closed down.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, who should regulate whom and how?
That will be one of the controversial questions at the G20 Summit.
Even if there is unanimity on the fact that there can be no return to unbridled developments on the financial market, the methods and extent of regulation are still the subject of fierce argument.
It will still be possible to reach agreement on equity rules, on rating agencies, possibly even on questions in connection with derivates and their licensing, but there will be argument on the question of unfair competition, taxes and control.
There will be arguments over bonuses and there will be arguments over Europe's demand for a Tobin tax.
In other words, as Europeans we have a responsibility to do our own homework, regardless of the outcome of the G20 Summit and the Commission is on the right path by not relying solely on it.
The motto must be: no financial market players, no financial products and no financial centre with no supervision in future.
However, global economic recovery is also on the agenda.
We cannot carry on here as in the past and maintain the imbalances in the world for the benefit of the US and for the benefit of the large industrial countries.
We must devote ourselves to overcoming poverty and hunger in the world and the G20 Summit must give new momentum to this.
I should like to add one point that no one, with the exception of Commissioner Almunia, has addressed so far.
It will be necessary to abide by the Stability and Growth Pact in Europe, not to bury it.
It is only because we had this pact, because we revised and maintained it, that it was at all possible for Europe to remain capable of action.
This should remain a European objective: a fast exit strategy out of excessive debt into a stable economy, to the Stability and Growth Pact as we know it.
<D>
(PL) Mr President, Mrs Angelilli's report will help all parents to protect their children from paedophiles who prowl the Internet.
We should remember that all the support we receive in the form of filters and monitoring service suppliers on the Internet does not relieve us, as parents, from our obligation to protect and warn our children.
I live in a small village, where people know each other and are interested in what is happening around them.
A stranger arouses interest.
In a small village in the south of Poland it would be difficult for someone to make contact with the children unnoticed, but I venture to say that in just such peaceful and safe places all over Europe, when the parents are quietly reading the newspaper or watching television, an unwanted stranger is in their children's bedroom, and has made contact with them over the Internet.
Are we, as parents, helpless?
No, we are not.
Perhaps our children are more proficient in using the new technologies.
Perhaps it is difficult to get them away from their computers.
Dear parents, do something today to protect your children.
Remind them of something we were taught, namely: 'do not talk to strangers.'
It is such a simple message.
Today, those strangers are not lurking outside the school with a bag of sweets, they enter Internet chat rooms and seek their victims there.
They are more dangerous, because we do not see when they slip without difficulty from one child's bedroom to another.
We should teach our children that they must not talk to strangers, and likewise on the Internet, shut the door in their face.
<D>
(SV) Mr President, Russia's attack on Georgia is not an isolated incident.
What we are seeing is a paradigm shift in Russia's relations with its neighbouring states - a paradigm shift that may have serious consequences if the EU does not act wisely.
In truth we are at a crossroads, as Secretary of State Mr Jouyet has said.
I am concerned because a large number of EU leaders are already talking in favour of a return to business as usual in the EU's relations with Russia.
They are acting as if the war in Georgia had not happened, but Russian troops, as many as 8 000 men, are still in the occupied areas.
Ethnic cleansing is still going on.
The EU must send a clear message and strongly condemn Russia's imperialistic policy, whereby it thinks it has the right to protect 'its' citizens by occupying sovereign states.
Today Georgia, tomorrow Ukraine and Belarus.
I will be repeating this at the meeting with the Russian delegation in Moscow on Friday.
If the EU instigates unconditional agreement negotiations with Russia under the premises that exist today, then we are approving Russia's action in Georgia and giving Russia authority in blank to continue its imperialistic policy.
The EU has a duty to help the victims, not the attackers.
I would like to congratulate Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner on her proposal of EUR 500 million and I hope that the pledging conference is successful tomorrow.
<D>
To answer these two questions, I cannot agree with you more.
The Union should change strategy in relation to Copenhagen.
The Union should explain its position much more, the Union should talk much more with groups of countries that have significantly different opinions to ours and, yes, you are right, the link between climate change and the Millennium Development Goals is plain to see.
Clearly, we cannot expect, and especially not in the coming years, in the next few years, the same effort from those who have to reduce a heavy industrial base, such as we have within the Union and developing countries have.
This is seemingly not enough, but this is also why the Union contributes so much to the 'fast start' principle, which is financing aimed at helping developing countries.
This scheme is very clearly aimed at countries that cannot afford this reduction.
I think that this forms a whole.
Dialogue and appropriate resources should enable developing countries to think more deeply about their own objectives in terms of reduction, in particular, of greenhouse gas emissions.
Subject: Programme of the Presidency - early school leaving
The chapter of the Belgian Presidency's programme entitled 'Education, Training, Youth, Sport, Culture and Audiovisual Policy' states that the Presidency will pay particular attention to the problems associated with the failure to complete schooling, as well as to the role of education and training in social inclusion.
What initiatives exactly has the Presidency taken so far to achieve the above commitments and what timetable does it intend to follow through to the end of the year?
Does the Council have any data providing evidence that the current economic situation is exacerbating the problem of early school leaving in the Member States which are affected by it?
<D>
rapporteur. - (LT) I would like to thank all my colleagues for their support.
This debate has revealed that the package is of huge importance and we simply cannot forget how complicated it was for the Commission to prepare it and to ensure that this agreement is adopted.
I think we must value the fact that, within a very short space of time, Member States were able to come to an agreement, and this document is in Parliament and will be put to the vote.
It was very difficult, I think, to strike a geographic balance for the funding of these projects and assess recovery measures (by which I mean how much they will impact on macroeconomic processes and individual sectors), and to use various energy subsector projects for funding.
Thus I believe that the composition, which we now have, must provide a result, and today I was very glad to hear Commissioner Piebalgs mention that calls for tender should be announced before the end of May.
This demonstrates that we are reacting in a sufficiently strategic manner, knowing the sensitivity of this whole question.
I think that this package is also very important in the sense that investment processes in the European Union are slowing significantly in the face of the economic crisis, and this package will be a very good impetus and signal both to Member States and energy companies to continue their investment activities, so that our strategic energy goals within the European Union can be achieved.
Once again I thank everyone for their support and I urge you to vote and support this package.
<D>
Mr President, I would like to say to the President-in-Office of the Council: what a wonderful summit.
I never doubted that you would make it, but it is one thing not to doubt and another to do it, and you did it.
Congratulations.
I do not know if colleagues know: it is a bit of a landmark in history.
On the first day, we got a new Treaty of the real world.
I know that all the maximalists here do not think it is the most beautiful treaty they have got, but the real world is not the most beautiful world you can get.
So what you need is an effective treaty, a treaty of clear values - and you have got it.
On the second day, friends, we got a direction - on the first day a treaty, on the second day a direction - which deals with what people would like us to do: the real world.
What you said on the second day was that we want a Europe leading globalisation to be more human, to be more inclusive and to base it on our social coherent values.
What you said was that the Lisbon process is not only a process for a few, but the guideline for the external direction of the European Union, which says that it is not only about being the world's strongest economic power, it is also by understanding that the world will only be more cohesive by basing it on a social market economy.
That is what I want to underline to you today.
I want to thank the Presidency, not only for the first day but also for the second day, because the conclusion of the second day was that this European Union is not about market societies.
It is about social market economies, which means that we are frontrunners in uniting social issues with economic competitiveness.
Well done, President-in-Office - and friend, if I can say that - because that leads me to my third and last message.
Let us give the Portuguese Presidency its last summit in December: not only where a Portuguese Presidency will formally sign the Treaty, but also where we confirm the Lisbon Process in a well-done way.
So let us go.
Let us move.
That is what people expect of us.
<D>
Mr President, the situation we are discussing is an eloquent example which shows that it is sometimes easier to achieve a consensus and gain political agreement on the opening of borders than it is to overcome technical problems.
The entry of new Member States to Schengen on 23 December 2007 was a great event for the citizens of those states.
I know this, because I am from Poland.
My country availed itself of this blessing and very much values the opening of the borders, because it meant the disappearance of the last discriminating circumstance which divided us from the Member States of the old European Union.
Also, it is in my country that the Frontex agency is based.
I know that Mr Barrot has been to Poland, where he held talks in Frontex and also visited the part of the EU's external border for which Poland is responsible.
I know that in practice, there are no serious problems with guarding this border, and that it is secure.
However, we do have problems with technical matters, the solution of which is growing into a political problem, as my colleague Mrs Roure said.
I fully agree with her.
If, however, there are technical problems, if there are difficulties, then I suppose every EU institution has a responsibility to address the body which took so long to implement SIS II.
It is a pity this has not been done and that transparency in this material has been a little forced.
I think that wherever the resolution of problems which are important for citizens is concerned, the European Parliament cannot agree that any actions should be taken independently of it, or that it should be ignored, especially in the case of a matter of security.
I should like to close with a very small remark.
If there were problems, if Hewlett-Packard did not manage to surmount the technical problems, it should be remembered that we have splendid specialists in Poland, young people who are wonderful IT engineers, and who are renowned the world over.
I think they could be useful, and could produce the desired result significantly cheaper, faster and better.
<D>
(PL) Mr President, I would like to begin by adding my own voice to the words of profound gratitude for the Portuguese Presidency.
Considerable success has been achieved.
The European Union needed a way out of the sense of defeat and failure, it needed a political dimension, and thanks to the Portuguese Presidency, it has one.
I also consider it to be of exceptional importance that the Charter of Fundamental Rights is an element of those decisions, and I would like to add here that the Charter of Fundamental Rights is the compass, the instrumentarium, of Europe.
I cannot even imagine how a country that wishes to be part of the European Union could at the same time dissociate itself from that which constitutes its moral, philosophical and political foundation.
Critical words were spoken by my colleague Mr Duff regarding the position of the British Government, which demanded an opt-out.
I am in a better position.
The Polish Government, which asked for an opt-out as the result of a decision taken by the Polish people, is leaving power.
I would like to express the profound hope that following the political change-over that has taken place in my country, and out of loyalty to the Polish tradition of solidarity, Poland will observe the Charter of Fundamental Rights in full.
Poland will accede to the Charter of Fundamental Rights in full, without any opt-out.
<D>
Madam President, the scandal of discards is one of the EU's own making.
Impossible quotas and restrictions are imposed in mixed fisheries, prohibited stocks are inevitably caught and in consequence they are dumped back - dead - into the sea.
And all this while hunger prevails in many parts of the world.
For years the EU has wrung its hands over this but, frankly, has done nothing to stop it.
Such fish, I believe, should be landed; they should be sold at a fixed price, sufficiently low to discourage deliberate catching and sufficiently high to make their landing worthwhile.
Also, it is sensible and right that we should reward the use of more selective fishing gear.
But I do most positively reject any blanket discard ban as translating into yet another device of driving more of our fishermen out of business.
We have ruminated on this issue for years.
Now is the time, at last, to do something about it.
<D>
in writing. - (RO) The measure of fingerprinting the citizens of Roma origin does not comply either with the European legislation or with any other act guaranteeing human rights in Europe.
For supporting this measure, Directive 380 of 28 April 2008 was invoked, which provides for the possibility to fingerprint third country citizens.
Nevertheless, I emphasize the fact that this act refers only to countries that are not part of the European Union area; therefore, the measure cannot be justified in this way.
Fundamentally, Directive 2004/38 guarantees the free movement of all EU Member States citizens, no matter their ethnic origin.
Consequently, the infringement proceeding can be initiated against Italy and the European Commission should inform about the illegal nature of the measure provided under the Italian ordinance for civil protection.
There are already positions of certain international institutions against this measure.
The Council of Europe has firmly condemned the fingerprinting initiative.
I think it is time for the European Parliament to take a stand and firmly respond to this situation.
<D>
(RO) The last two rounds of enlargement of the European Union have brought numerous benefits to old and new Member States alike, while also posing a number of challenges.
Two years after its accession to the European Union, Romania is one of the countries with the lowest success rates in terms of accessing European funds.
The procedure for accessing European money is fairly complicated and impenetrable.
The Structural and Cohesion Funds provide financial leverage which may facilitate economic recovery, particularly during the current crisis.
Against this background, I feel that we need simple rules for accessing the Structural Funds so that European money can reach beneficiaries as quickly as possible.
Particular attention must be focused on removing all those difficulties that hamper access to Community funds and discourage people from obtaining EU financial support.
We must encourage efforts at European level aimed at simplifying the procedures for accessing the funds earmarked for Romania in order to accelerate their allocation and rapid absorption.
<D>
(SL) We have seen and heard reports that the long-standing civil war in Sri Lanka is coming to an end.
However, it was military predominance, not political achievement or any lasting solution, that drove the Tamil Tigers out of their last major stronghold.
This military solution is fraught with problems.
We see winners and losers, the losers being the tens of thousands of local civilians who are withdrawing or fleeing in fear of government units.
Experience from the Western Balkans teaches us that military victories and formal cessations of military hostilities are often followed by the killing of the losers or their supposed sympathisers by the winners.
Victories can leave a trail of individual, uncontrolled acts of retribution, but frequently also organised killings, which the perpetrators usually seek to conceal.
I am not trying to accuse anyone ahead of time.
I am just trying to point out that the European Union must also take immediate action to ensure an international presence and international supervision during this most critical post-conflict period, a period which leaves the civilian population, who are fleeing in fear, in the greatest peril.
<D>
in writing. - (ET) It is essential that this coming winter the Governments of the Member States do everything possible to support individuals for whom the rise in energy prices may be too much.
Price rises of up to 30-40 per cent are also forecast in Estonia.
I am especially worried about the impact which rising energy prices may have on those on low incomes, the poor and vulnerable groups.
I agree one hundred per cent that the Member States must take adequate measures to guarantee affordable energy prices.
These include dedicated income support and abatements, and incentives to improve the energy efficiency of domestic households.
I am also convinced that the Member States should compile action plans to combat energy poverty.
There is above all a need to define 'energy poverty'.
Definition of the concept would help focus attention on the objectives.
We must lift everyone out of fuel poverty!
Unlike for example in Great Britain, at home, in Estonia, the term 'energy poverty' is very strange.
It is a typical example of Euro-jargon which, whether intentionally or not, is creeping into use.
Behind it, however, is a very interesting idea with which the authors of legislation must familiarise themselves.
Dedicated support for the elderly, large families and the disabled along the lines of 'winter fuel payments' or 'cold weather payments' in Great Britain play an important role.
Measures such as these are, in my view, a magnificent example to others.
There is much talk of savings but little action, although action would be the quickest way of changing anything.
The better insulated and energy-efficient our homes, the less we will have to spend on maintaining the temperature inside them.
The savings would be large because in Estonia, for example, buildings absorb 40% of primary energy.
But on this point we must not rely on leaving things to the initiative of each person feeling the cold.
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, I take the floor in various capacities, not just as a coordinator for the largest political group here in Parliament, but also as someone who played a leading role in discussing this dossier during the previous mandate and, above all, as somebody who, in a previous business career, actually introduced works councils into several different businesses: somebody who fundamentally believes in developing information and consultation and who does know something about what works and what does not work - certainly a true champion of the philosophy.
Commissioner, it is surely a supreme irony that such an issue - which is all about social dialogue and two sides of industry getting together - should actually fall at the first fence because the ETUC refuses to sit down and discuss it.
I do commend you for having tried, and for still trying, to kick-start the dialogue.
But if you say that if there is no dialogue then you will introduce legislation anyway, where is the incentive for both sides to sit down?
Where is the penalty on one side for not having been prepared to sit down?
I suggest to you - and I say this with a heavy heart - that the solution surely for you, Commissioner, is, when you are 'reviewing your options', for any proposal from you to reflect the fact that one party was prepared to talk and one party was not.
Finally, in a world of increasing globalisation and the need, of course, to restructure companies in order to keep pace, the issues of information and consultation of workers are of critical importance.
Yet what do we see?
A failure of social dialogue, a failure of the social partnership, and a failure by the very people who should be giving a lead.
By refusing to negotiate, the European trade unions have not just failed themselves; they have failed the workers they claim to represent.
When the issue finally does come before the Parliament, we as MEPs must make sure that we do not fail.
<D>
in writing. - (DA) The aim of this proposal, according to the Commission, is to improve the framework conditions for business in the EU's internal market.
The proposal will achieve this by giving enterprises the ability to freely choose the EU Member State in which to have their registered address, regardless of where their actual operations take place, and for them only to be obliged to comply with the laws of the country in which they have their registered address.
This will open the way for the circumvention of hard-won workers' rights in the EU Member States.
The truth is specific.
Allow me to be specific.
A Danish company with a registered address in Copenhagen and 35 employees is, under Danish law, obliged to accept the workers appointing representatives to the management of the enterprise.
This ensures that the workers get some insight into the position and future of the enterprise.
If the proposal that has been submitted is adopted unchanged, the company in question could simply register itself as a European company based in Finland.
Suddenly, 150 employees are required in order to obtain employee representation.
In most other EU Member States, the situation is even worse.
Perhaps the Commission's proposal will be improved slightly in the forthcoming negotiations.
Perhaps the text that is finally adopted will not be so bad.
In any case, we should ask ourselves the question 'why'?
Why does the Commission time and again submit proposals, the only objective of which is to reduce the rights of workers?
Could it perhaps be that there is something fundamentally wrong with the EU?
<D>
(CS) Mr President, in light of the fact that the words 'too little too late' have already been uttered many times when assessing the social package, I shall give my assessment: the mountain has given birth to a mouse.
My question is: 'what have you been doing for four years?'
You have been putting forward socially unacceptable proposals, the culmination being the Working Time Directive so highly vaunted by the Council and the Commission.
As a result, there is no option but to regard the proposed social package, despite some of its positive aspects, as propaganda aimed at attaching the label 'social' to the European Commission's letterhead.
Most of the proposals need not be discussed at all, so it is nothing more than a flash in the pan.
It is quite easy to proclaim that the common market is for the people and not the people for the market and that, if binding rules are to be laid down on the behaviour of companies in the market, then it is necessary to lay down minimum rules on the position of EU employees, a minimum wage set as a percentage of the average wage in all Member States, the same treatment and the same wages for employees working in countries other than their own.
It is enough to declare that the Union upholds observance of the International Labour Organization conventions on maximum working time, freedom of trade union association and collective bargaining.
Competition between Member States as to who has the lowest taxes and wages and the least transparency in the position of trade unions will happily continue and the open method of coordination is just another ineffective way of dealing with something that nobody wants to do.
To those who criticise the French Presidency, I should like to say: 'Wait until the Czech Presidency.
You ain't seen nothing yet.'
A few weeks ago, the President vetoed an act prohibiting discrimination, saying it was superfluous.
<D>
(ES) In my capacity as leader of the Spanish Socialist delegation to the European Parliament, I should like to express my appreciation of the words spoken by the President of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament supported by the President of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats).
I do so for two reasons.
Firstly, because as I see it, this House is clearly demonstrating its solidarity with Mrs Haidar personally and with her cause in this dangerous situation resulting from a prolonged hunger strike.
My second reason is that I believe the House is also adopting a positive stance in support of the intense multilateral diplomatic effort led by the government of the Kingdom of Spain.
This is, after all, the government of the country on whose territory Mrs Haidar is currently to be found.
It is also the government of the country in which the hunger strike is taking place that Mrs Haidar herself has stated will not end until she returns to a territory that is not under Spanish jurisdiction.
I therefore support the current diplomatic effort, and believe that our best course of action would be to avoid a resolution that could compromise the success of any negotiations that might take place in the next few hours...
(The President cut off the speaker)
<D>
in writing. - I would like this report to have looked more closely at the situation of orphans and disabled children in institutional care in Romania and Bulgaria, the newest EU Member States.
There was a great deal of concern before those countries joined the EU about the standards of care for institutionalised orphans and disabled children.
Perhaps the next such report could go into more detail on this matter.
More generally, I made my thoughts on this report known in the debate last month.
I am worried that our culture of human rights has become infected by absolutism and that, in fact, by pandering to the rights of criminals and terrorists we are undermining the rights of everyone else.
Specifically, I believe that matters concerning abortion and contraception are not matters for the European Union, but should be subject to appropriate legislation at the level of the Member States.
Also, I object to the call for the Charter of Fundamental Rights to override the law of the United Kingdom, which has negotiated an exemption from its provisions.
I therefore voted to abstain on this report.
<D>
Mr President, I welcome the long-awaited proposal on completion of the anti-discrimination package, which means that we can finally end the hierarchy of rights.
A European Union in which some Europeans are more equal than others has failed in its mission.
I completely concur with the wise words of Gérard Deprez: the directive needs substantial improvement.
It contains far too many escape clauses, which risk codifying existing discriminatory practices rather than ending them.
Family law and public order are, and remain, a national competence, but in practice they are being used - or misused - as a pretext for discrimination, mainly against homosexuals.
It is a shame that the Commission seems to be condoning this.
Freedom of religion is a fundamental right and one that I will defend ferociously, but it is an individual right: it is not a collective right for certain groups that entitles them to discriminate and not apply the law.
Finally, I would like to add that, ironically, this package seems to provide a higher level of protection against discrimination on all grounds apart from gender discrimination.
The gap between the directive on gender discrimination and this directive will have to be closed.
<D>
Mr President, Commissioner, I am pleased that we are having this debate.
Of course we have intensive relations with both these countries, but I would like to talk about Mexico in particular.
In our debate, we in the Committee on International Trade saw it as particularly important to discuss matters that affect our area.
It is especially important to us that we strengthen the free-trade agreement once again.
If you look at the figures, you can see that, although our trade has definitely intensified in recent years, there is still considerable demand and that we - and the European side - still have considerable restrictions when it comes to market access.
I would sincerely ask you, Commissioner, to again do everything you can to analyse the situation once more together with your competent colleagues and, where problems exist, to really lift these restrictions.
It makes no sense whatsoever for us, on the one hand, to talk about strategic partnerships with such important countries in Latin America and then, on the other hand, to still have to battle with such absurd market restrictions.
Sometimes, of course, they make sense, but as a rule they are in fact not useful at all.
I would be very grateful to you, and to the committee, if we could resolve this matter.
The second point that we feel is important is that, in the context of global international relations, we should also truly give Mexico the status it deserves.
This, of course, relates in particular to the still very fragile arrangement in connection with the G20.
Our delegation has written a letter, which we have also sent to you, in which we ask that Mexico also sit at the G20 table and for this to be a permanent arrangement rather than merely a brief appearance.
My final request is for you to attend our delegation meeting on 30 and 31 March; I know that you cannot attend personally, but for you to arrange for someone from your area of competence to attend when Mr Guadarrama, Mr Buganza and Mr Green, who chair the Mexico delegation, come so that they really feel that the Commission values the delegation and its visit.
<D>
author. - Mr President, my group strongly supports the motion for a resolution concerning Mr Kambakhsh, although I am not sure I would agree with everything the previous speaker has said.
However, I want to shift attention to another young man whose life is also in danger at the moment, Mehdi Kazemi, who is from Iran, and where the British Government, in this case, could make a difference.
Many of us hope that the Home Secretary, Jacqui Smith, will now intervene on the basis of new evidence.
This Parliament has passed many motions for resolutions which have condemned the human rights record in Iran.
We believe that it is a dangerous country for homosexuals.
Indeed, we have seen the bodies hanging from cranes, so we know that it is, and many of us believe that it is dangerous for this young man in particular.
There are those who have said that it is safe for him to be returned if his behaviour is discreet.
I would suggest that what constitutes 'discreet' behaviour in Iran is rather different from what that might mean in our own Member States.
But the issue is that for many, in certain countries, whether they are in Iran, Jamaica or elsewhere, being gay is a crime and they are at risk.
My group has been very critical of the Dublin Regulation which is involved in this case, because we know there are still very large variations in the way in which asylum requests are treated between Member States, and that even access to the procedure can be extremely difficult.
We have seen a climate where numbers have been regarded as more important than life.
This is the substance of a protection procedure: it is about saving somebody's life when it is at risk.
It is not about the niceties of correct procedures: it is about the effect.
We want a functioning asylum policy which is able to correct errors and take account of new information, and which gives the same high standard across Member States.
We hope that in this case the British Government will be demonstrating that this is possible.
<D>
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (EL) Mr President, the reverberations from the NATO summit in Bucharest have reached this Parliament.
It is comforting that Europe has at last taken a position on an issue concerning it, as there is usually little enthusiasm to take a position when others are making decisions.
I therefore, think that all parties have learnt a useful lesson especially the FYROM.
This new republic has not yet learnt European diplomatic practice, having placed its hopes on accession to ΝΑΤΟ simply because of US promises and infantile, misguided hopes of liberation from bondage.
In negotiations between European states provocation and fanaticism should never be an option.
Choices should not be made on the imaginary basis of ancestry, neighbouring cultures and history; instead, we should act in a spirit of consensus, comprehension and, above all, probity in order to find a solution rather than worsen problems.
A positive approach will benefit FYROM, which we hope will be helped to join both ΝΑΤΟ and the EU.
If FYROM refuses to accept the name chosen for it and persists in this refusal, it will find that there are obstacles to its accession, because it has undermined its own efforts.
If its efforts are undermined now, perhaps its future will also be undermined.
<D>
Madam President, let me start by thanking Mrs Hedh and Mrs Bauer for their hard work as co-rapporteurs.
This directive concerns prosecution, prevention and protection in the area of human trafficking.
The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance would have liked to have seen somewhat more thorough work, in particular, as regards protecting the victims of human trafficking.
I refer here particularly to the right of residence in a country after the victim has been trafficked and, perhaps, rescued.
How do we ensure that victims really can build a new life?
Now, that question has not been sufficiently regulated by this directive.
Here, we are merely talking about a form of temporary residence permit, after which you do not know whether or not you will be sent back to the place from which you have been trafficked.
We are therefore pinning our hopes on the directive being recast, so that we can sort out some solution or another.
We are hoping that that will enable us to start giving real help to the victims.
Another aspect that leads to heated debate in this House is the question of whether or not those who use the services of a trafficked individual should be penalised.
However, the majority of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance remain of the opinion that penalising such people only serves to push the trafficked individual into deeper misery, because his or her activity then becomes totally illegal.
I am also pleased to see that, in this directive, Member States will retain freedom of choice on that score, but I would like to ask any Member State dealing with such issues the following: how should we then empower the victim?
<D>
It is an acknowledged fact that using pesticides poses a threat to both human health and the environment.
The purpose of the 'Thematic Strategy on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides' is to reduce the risks to human health and the environment posed by the use of pesticides.
Harmonisation of the environmental protection requirements and conformity assessment procedures for machinery for pesticide application is a prerequisite to achieving the same level of environmental protection throughout the EU, but also to ensuring fair competition between manufacturers and facilitating the free movement of these products within the Community.
The correct design and construction of this machinery play a significant role in reducing the adverse impact of pesticides on human health and the environment.
Assuming that a pesticide sprayer has an average service life of 12 to 15 years, it is estimated that approximately 125 000 to 250 000 new sprayers are purchased in the Community every year.
Thanks to their greater efficiency, sprayers which comply with the new environmental requirements use less pesticide, thereby reducing the time spent on mixing, loading, spraying and cleaning activities, not to mention the savings this generates for users, which will compensate for any increase in the price of certain types of spraying equipment.
This is why I voted in favour of this report.
<D>
I urgently requested that this issue be discussed in plenary once more, not only because it concerns thousands of workers in my back yard, Antwerp in Flanders - you will see that many Members of the European Parliament will take the floor on this issue - but also, in particular, because it concerns a pan-European restructuring operation involving the closure of one plant and the loss of thousands of other jobs.
Thousands of people - men and women and their families - face a gloomy future.
I believe that these people are looking to the European Union today with a mixture of hope and fear.
Do they have good reason to hope?
Perhaps.
I should like to ask you, Commissioner and Commission, what your further plans are, as I make no secret of the fact that I am extremely disappointed with Commissioner Kroes' further reiteration today that, in the event of the dossier coming up for discussion, she will apply the rules on State aid.
I am also disappointed with your response and position today, however.
Naturally, if the closure ever goes ahead, we shall have to ensure that people are offered assistance.
Yet today, we are looking for a quite different European Commission, one that takes this dossier to heart and plays the political role it should be playing.
It can start by requiring Opel's European management to put the business plan on the table at long last and to provide full access to the economic and other arguments forming the basis for this decision.
After all, as I am sure you know, the European management in Antwerp, for example, has received very large amounts of aid and resources from both the Flemish and the Belgian authorities in recent years to enable it to remain competitive.
Now all of that is being brushed aside, and there is no strong European Commission to do anything about it.
My second message, which is also a very definite request to the Commission, is that I should like to see the Commission taking much clearer action and being much less compromising in future when it comes to restructuring operations.
If two businesses merge, the European Commission must be notified, so why can this not be the case with restructuring?
Why can the Commission not apply the same economic and social criteria to restructuring operations?
Only then will there be a clear vision for both industrial policy and a social Europe.
That is what the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament is calling for.
<D>
(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the latest figures given in the annual report on the activities of Eurodac for 2006, which is the biometric tool that Europe uses for monitoring asylum seekers, show that the number of persons who illegally crossed one of the EU borders has increased by 64% since 2005.
This worrying development only proves, if proof were needed, that Europe is powerless to control its external borders and to contain the exponential growth in illegal immigration, especially from Africa.
The only crumb of comfort in the report is that Parliament seems to have woken up to the fact that the en-masse regularisation of immigrants who have illegally entered the territory of the European Union is not in itself a solution and will not solve the problem.
Well hallelujah!
Nevertheless, Spain, Belgium, France, Italy and the Netherlands first had to resort to this dangerous policy of regularisation, which inevitably gave rise to the so-called 'aspiration' phenomenon and by this fact influenced the migratory flows of their European neighbours, before this awareness finally dawned on them.
Let us be positive, however.
We have at least made a start.
However, if we are to fight illegal immigration effectively there is one measure that has to be introduced as a matter of urgency: re-establish the European Union's external border controls.
This gimmick that is Frontex, a real empty shell with insufficient men or equipment that is not even supported by some European countries, anxious as they are to preserve their sovereignty over immigration management, will never save Europe from this infernal spiral.
Europe itself is to blame for the continuing and exponential problem of immigration by having signed-up to the criminal Schengen agreements.
It must annul these, and quickly.
<D>
- Mr President, I think this is a very important report we have in front of us given the fact that our rapporteur, Francisco Millán Mon, has been able to bring this report from the Committee on Foreign Affairs almost unanimously.
I have not known that in the past: all groups actually combining to show that they are in favour of a stronger transatlantic partnership.
Indeed, I have noted that, in this report, we now, for the first time, call it the most strategic partnership that we have.
We have lots of other ones, but this one is the key one for us in the European Union.
As was mentioned earlier, there is a new tone, but I sense too that this is a tone from the Americans looking to what Europe can do to be a partner in the global system and that we then have to think what we are going to be able to contribute to this process.
I think that the highlight in this debate was you, Madam Commissioner, saying that what we are looking for is a more strategic dialogue, the ability to look at long-term trends, like the NIC report 2025 does; to be able to look further down the road to see that we can share a common analysis together, to be able to come to common action together as a result of that.
I suspect this will need some generation within the European Union, perhaps our support in the 2010 budget, to be able to formulate our own long-term thinking - because there is very little long-term thinking, either in the Commission or indeed even in our House, about long-term trends such as is found in the NIC report.
In doing so, we are going to have to find a way to establish a more even playing field for the involvement of Europeans and Americans in these debates.
In the past five years we have seen a huge influx of US think tanks into Brussels telling us what we should be doing on particular aspects of policy, but there is very little about Europeans in Washington being able to communicate to the Americans what our ideas are on the shaping of European policy.
We need to focus on that to provide the right budgetary input to give that kind of impact, so that we get an even input and feed-in into our transatlantic discussions.
<D>
Mr President, as a Member of EuroLat I welcome the EU Strategic Partnership with Brazil and Mexico, both thriving democracies.
The word 'BRIC' - for Brazil, Russia, India and China - is very much in the vocabulary of foreign-policy specialists, and Brazil is indeed an emerging global player.
President Lula has demonstrated moderation in government and has been a stabilising force against the rise of populist demagogues like Chávez in Venezuela and Morales in Bolivia.
Brazil will be hit now by the credit crunch and the fall in commodity prices.
Mexico will also be affected by the dramatic fall in oil prices.
These two countries have enjoyed stability.
I also commend the work of President Calderón in Mexico and he also deserves our support in his struggle against the drug cartels.
The two countries, being embedded respectively in NAFTA and Mercosur, are big players in the region and they are key to our relations with Latin America.
<D>
in writing. - (PT) This report places particular importance on those aspects which aim to ensure food safety, bearing in mind consumer interests and, prominent among them, the desire for food to be as natural as possible.
It is well-known that not all flavourings which are safe from a toxicological point of view are actually beneficial to consumers, hence the need to guarantee the right of the consumer to choose.
In the procedure for the approval of flavourings, 'reasonable technological need' is combined with other EU strategies, such as the fight against obesity, as the addition of excessively potent flavourings can mask the poor quality of prepared food.
The Council and Parliament take a different stance on the issue of certain food ingredients with flavouring properties for use in and on foods, and on the maximum levels of those ingredients laid down in Annex III.
We know that the principle of herb and spice producers having to disprove a legal presumption of harmfulness for each product individually is contentious.
It would be more logical to turn the procedure around.
This issue will continue to be a matter of controversy.
<D>
- (LT) Last year's EU report consisted of 104 pages, 4 of which were dedicated to the subject of human rights.
This year the figures are 216 and 10 accordingly.
Facts stated in last year's report, such as the development of the Fundamental Rights Agency and Parliament's work in this sphere, were repeated again.
Nevertheless, the report gives a detailed account of how we Europeans are defending the rights of people worldwide.
However, not a single word has been said either in the report or in the resolution about the protection of human rights or any cases of breaches within the Union.
Are there no cases at all in which human rights have been breached in the EU, or if, perhaps, they do occur, do we in fact resolve them fairly and without delay?
In my opinion, neither happens to be the case.
It looks as if it is easier to speak about the sins of others than to admit to our own.
Are we not aware of the fact that illegal recruitment agencies in London are making slaves of immigrants from Lithuania and Poland?
Do we not know that in Paris mass arrests of 'illegal' persons are taking place by order of President Sarkozy?
What about the unlawful actions against Romanians in Rome?
Of course, the aggrieved can appeal to the court in Strasbourg.
In several years' time, when cases in that court amount to thousands, justice might be restored.
However, every day and every hour is of great importance to the people concerned.
We have been elected to work for our people, represent them and protect their rights.
Let us turn to face them.
In Europe every person should be safe.
Then we would be stronger and in a better position to help others.
<D>
Madam President, first of all I would like to welcome the report today and congratulate the rapporteur on his work.
Cross-compliance and how it is implemented at Member State level are crucial.
We must not allow each other - and each and every Member State - to make their own interpretation.
If you listen to what Ms McGuinness and Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf said this morning, it shows the difference in interpretation in different Member States.
We have got to get it right at Member State level, and we have got to insist that each Member State implement this directive in the right and proper way in each and every Member State.
Farmers need and require less inspection, not more.
When inspection happens, there must be sufficient notice before inspection occurs.
It is madness, in my opinion, to fine any farmer for the smallest detail; this is already happening.
Farmers should be allowed a period to put right any problem that is identified, not just be told that they have defaulted and will be penalised.
There is a great need to reduce bureaucracy and red tape in farming.
Cross-compliance must not become a system that allows farmers to be penalised and policed.
We should be there to help farmers and to offer advice on how they can do things better.
Cross-compliance could be a force for good, and those who do the inspections should have clear and proper training and know their responsibilities.
Yes, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf is right.
I had an inspection at my farm which lasted seven hours.
The only thing they could find wrong was that one little part of it was no longer considered to be arable land and we had built a poultry unit, which we did not inform them about.
Now, really, an oversight as simple as that - building a poultry unit on your farm and not having informed them within the 12-month period - I do not think is something that you should actually be penalised for.
You should be allowed to put it right at the earliest possible moment.
<D>
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that, in the current situation, we should be discussing what to do now.
I believe that what the Council has decided and what has been done is basically what was possible, although we could always quibble about whether an Extraordinary European Council of the Heads of State or Government should not have been held straightaway to show our cohesion, but so be it.
I believe that we must now ask some fundamental questions.
The most fundamental question clearly concerns our position towards Russia, our cooperation with Russia and how we are in fact going to solve these problems in the Caucasus, because there is also Nagorno-Karabakh.
We could from now on see permanent conflicts and President Sarkozy could therefore find himself permanently faced with such situations.
He could take a room in the Kremlin and remain there indefinitely; that would also be a possibility.
My opinion is as follows: firstly, Mr Daul, if there is something that we should not be discussing, it is Georgia and Ukraine joining NATO.
This is truly the most idiotic idea at the moment because it means that we would be unable to go any further politically.
Will Georgia or Ukraine join NATO when its reforms have been carried out?
Perhaps, I am not sure.
However, this is not really the relevant issue today.
Do you think that, if Georgia had been in NATO, Article 5 would have been mobilised?
Of course not!
Therefore we should not talk rubbish.
On the other hand - and here I agree with Mr Watson - how we can control actions such as those of President Saakashvili?
While we agree that Russia's action was unacceptable, it was also unacceptable for a Georgian President to decide to bomb a town, for whatever reason!
If you are provoked, you should respond in another way, not by bombing.
Therefore there is a real political problem.
We propose to tackle this political problem as follows: we should propose to Georgia and Ukraine a privileged partnership as a first step towards possible integration.
This integration can then take place if there is a fundamental reform in Europe, and so on.
However, we should have political instruments and not just economic and social instruments to bring pressure to bear on these political classes.
A future in the European space specifically means a future in which these countries are rid of nationalism.
We should consider the phrase of François Mitterrand: 'nationalism is war'.
Georgian nationalism, Russian nationalism, Abkhazian nationalism and South Ossetian nationalism is war!
We in Europe must say 'our view is to go beyond that'.
Therefore, by proposing a European view, we are also proposing to put on the table European values because, if nationalism endures in these regions, we will never find a solution.
<D>
My political group, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, welcomes the result of today's vote on the Catherine Neris report on harmonised conditions for the marketing of construction products.
First-reading approval with the Council was not possible because some of the Member States did not agree to a compulsory statement of conformity.
Today's vote establishes the European Parliament's position on some politically sensitive issues, particularly the CE mark, which should convince the Council to reach a common position followed by approval from the European Parliament and the Commission at second reading.
My political group, the PPE-DE, in an agreement with the Socialist Party in the European Parliament, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, has only supported technical improvements to the text and through our additional amendment proposals we have brought the text passed by the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection closer to the working text of the Council.
The PPE-DE did not support Amendments 17 and 54 which were passed in committee, because it agreed with the Commission proposal - we are opposed to the introduction of intra-state markings, because they represent a barrier to the internal market and we agree that Member States should eliminate all national references demonstrating conformity other than the CE mark.
I am delighted that this position received clear backing from Commissioner Verheugen in yesterday's debate.
I wish the legislation success.
<D>
Vice-President of the Commission. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen.
Toys are not like any other product.
They are designed for the most vulnerable consumer group of all and it is therefore perfectly clear that we must have the highest standards for toys where children's safety is concerned.
A whole range of very grave issues have rightly been raised here in connection with the latest recall campaigns of an American manufacturer, which has recalled faulty products from the market at its own initiative.
First of all I would like to say that both cases concerned here involve products not licensed under European law for the European market.
Toys with lead paint have, of course, been banned in Europe for a long time, unlike in the United States of America.
Toys with magnetic parts or other dangerous parts which could become loose have also been banned, of course, for a long time in Europe.
What we have here, therefore, is not a problem of applicable law (although I will be coming to applicable law, an area in which something has to be changed, later), but it is a problem of the implementation and observance of the applicable law.
Products we deal with every day cannot be one hundred per cent safe.
The best legislator in the world cannot guarantee that no defects will occur in production.
The best legislator in the world cannot guarantee that supply chains now organised on a global basis will not encounter a problem at any point.
Nor can the best legislator in the world prevent trade with criminal or fraudulent intent.
I would remind you of the case in which three people died in Greece after using a faulty steam iron.
This iron not only had the European CE marking, but also a specific German safety symbol.
Nevertheless the appliance was not safe, probably because it was counterfeit.
No legislator in the world can do anything to stop this.
That is the responsibility of the manufacturer and it is the responsibility of those who have to ensure that manufacturers comply with the existing rules.
These are the market surveillance authorities of the Member States.
There is no European market surveillance system.
This comes under the sole responsibility of the Member States.
I would like to point out to you that we are in fact having to deal with a problem here that is very closely connected with economic globalisation.
Today this means we have to deal with worldwide supply chains.
We have to deal with companies operating under pressure of costs, meaning that they are constantly putting their suppliers under pressure of costs, thereby contributing to prices constantly being reduced.
There is a very great risk that this will come at the expense of safety at some point.
This is the reason why we are constantly saying that the more international and more extensive the supply chain becomes, the greater the responsibility of companies to ensure that the existing regulations are observed at each individual stage of the supply chain.
This was not the case, for example, in the case of lead paint on toys produced by the American manufacturer.
A Chinese supplier supplied a paint here which it should not have supplied.
These is the truth of the case.
Corporate responsibility is foremost.
Companies are responsible for their product complying with the current European rules.
Then comes the responsibility of the Member States.
They have to ensure that market surveillance works.
And then it is up to us as European legislators.
We have to ensure that our legislation is kept up-to-date and possible risks are identified in good time and incorporated into the legislation.
This is why the Commission began a thorough review of the existing Toy Safety Directive more than two years ago.
The Toy Safety Directive is one of the oldest directives resulting from the 'new approach'.
It is clear that the toy market has changed dramatically in the last 20 years and this new directive will therefore pick up on a whole range of recently recognised risks and hazards and will ensure, with very strict rules - on the use of chemical substances in toys, for instance - that dangers are avoided.
The directive will be brought before the legislator by the end of this year.
At the beginning of this year, we had already put before you an entire package of measures for strengthening market surveillance for improving protection of the CE marking.
Let me say something about the CE marking at this point.
The CE marking means that the manufacturer (whether a European manufacturer or a manufacturer outside Europe wanting to sell in Europe) provides an absolute guarantee that its product is fully compliant with the rules in force in Europe.
The manufacturer guarantees this with the CE marking.
That is what the CE marking means.
In a whole range of cases, the manufacturer is not allowed to use the CE symbol on the basis of a self-declaration and his own proof, but must be certified by a third body, namely whenever there may be a risk to users due to the product not working properly.
Certification by a third body is now mandatory in all such cases.
The way these bodies, which we call Conformity Assessment Bodies, operate can be significantly improved.
We have put forward the appropriate proposals and they are available to you as the European legislator.
In relation to toys, a decision now has to be made about a very difficult issue for the Commission and for you as legislator: do we want to move to having each individual toy coming onto the market certified by a third body or do we want to leave it that the manufacturers provide the guarantee by using the CE marking and therefore also assume liability - to which I must also add that the manufacturers have to be able to prove at any time and with full documentation, according to the rules in force today, that they have been using the CE marking lawfully?
Or do we perhaps want to take a third way by defining certain types of toy in the new Toy Safety Directive, where we stipulate certification by a third body?
I do not want to hide the fact that I have great sympathy for this latter solution.
I would like to give you an example: what do we do with all the toys containing chips?
When children put them in their mouths, chips are a dangerous item.
There must therefore be a guarantee that these toy parts can under no circumstances pose a threat to children.
If we do not want to take Game Boys away from children - I do not believe that anyone intends to do this - the only possibility would then be to make certification by a third body mandatory at this point.
The Commission's ideas are along these lines and I also expect to get some impression from this debate of Parliament's thinking on this issue.
The final point I would like to mention is a request to manufacturers and consumer organisations.
Manufacturers need to be aware of the fact that the pressure of costs, as great as it still is, does not absolve them of the responsibility for a full inspection of every individual part of their production process and their supply chain.
The more international production and supply chains become, the greater the responsibility of companies active on the market.
Furthermore, consumer organisations would accomplish a great feat if they were to create an awareness that cheap is not always the same as good.
This is not just a question of safety, but also one of quality, because how often have you seen - even with toys the child opens under the Christmas tree - how a child plays with it just once before it is broken.
It might have been cheap, but it was not good!
Cheap does not always mean good, nor does cheap always mean safe.
This means the consumer needs to be aware that the price of a product has a direct bearing on the quality and safety of a product.
In relation to the low-price ideology, which is spreading in at least some Member States, this is a subject that gives me increasing cause for concern.
I can say in conclusion that European law today is in any case better than what we see in other parts of the world, that it can be improved and is being improved and that wherever toys are involved, the strictest standards of all are being applied and must be applied.
<D>
in writing. - (DE) We expressly support Croatia's swift accession to the European Union.
The people of Croatia have great expectations of this membership.
However, these can only be fulfilled if Croatia is truly ready for accession and all accession criteria are met.
Croatia has already come further in this process than many current EU Member States had come on accession.
The Commission's progress report clearly shows, however, that there is still work to be done in some areas.
This gives reason to hope for a swift conclusion to the accession negotiations - expectations must not be raised by today's decision, however.
Thoroughness is more important to us than speed and reliable implementation is more important than promises.
We must not repeat previous mistakes.
Anything else will not be in the interests of the European Union or Croatia and its people.
We have therefore abstained from voting today.
<D>
in writing. - One cannot underestimate the importance of paying special attention to the specific problems of fisheries and aquaculture.
This is obvious in view of this sector's economic, social and political importance in the EU.
In my country, Malta, both fishing and aquaculture are given special attention.
I fully concur with the Committee on Fisheries to recommend that, in the field of scientific marine research, priority be given not only to research to gain knowledge about the state of fish stocks but also to the commercial, economic and social aspects that determine fisheries management, since all these aspects are of crucial importance.
We have to ensure that in the fields of fisheries and aquaculture, priority be given to applied research.
It is unfortunate that in the short term a clear conflict of interests exists between fishermen and scientists.
In the long-term, objectives will be more compatible.
Research has to be undertaken in view of dwindling stocks.
This will result in the disappearance of whole species.
That is why it is imperative to have full cooperation in this field between scientists, fishermen and aquacultural operators.
<D>
(PT) In the two minutes I have to speak I would like once again to point out that budgetary history is repeating itself.
The European Commission presents the proposed Community budget, this time for 2008, the Council proposes significant cuts to the Commission proposal, and Parliament comes forward with a proposal for reducing the cuts in the Commission's and Council's drafts.
Everything seems normal, were it not that all these proposals are below the 2008 budget in the Financial Perspective for 2007-2013.
As happened in the previous financial framework for 2000-2006, the budget ceiling provided for in the current Financial Perspective is not being adhered to, since the Community budget in 2007 was EUR 1.6 billion less in commitment appropriations and more than EUR 8 billion less in payment appropriations, without taking account of actual implementation.
It is clear that the amounts entered in the Financial Perspective for 2007-2013 are already insufficient in themselves, in our opinion, to promote real economic and social cohesion in an enlarged European Union of 27 countries.
Basically, all these proposals for the 2008 Community budget run counter to the requirements of the rich countries which impose a ceiling on the budget of about 1% of Community GNI, thereby reducing its share of this budget and minimising its redistributive role.
Parliament's proposal covers aspects that improve the draft presented by the Council, such as increasing the appropriations for the cohesion policy, as we also proposed, though we should stress that its effective implementation is to a large extent undermined later to meet the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy's neoliberal agenda, which we firmly reject.
However, even Parliament's proposal represents a cut of more than EUR 5 billion in payment appropriations, in relation to what was agreed for 2008 in the multiannual financial framework.
Since this is a phase of the negotiation process, we hope that, in contrast to what has happened in the past, Parliament will at least seek to ensure that the minimum amounts laid down in the Financial Perspective for 2008 are adhered to as closely as possible.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I have listened carefully to the many positive, constructive remarks in the discussion here today.
First of all, as some of you have said, we have to make it very clear that we will not be facing a situation where there will be absolutely no margin in the agricultural budget.
We have a surplus because we have not had extraordinary expenditures - we have had very low costs on intervention and a very low cost on export refunds - and therefore we can manage this specific situation.
But we are not leaving ourselves in a situation where there is no margin in the budget, because of the reasons mentioned by Mr Mulder.
If we run into a situation with an animal disease, I can give a guarantee here today that we will not face a situation where there will be no money or insufficient money to solve these situations.
It is also important to underline the solidarity in the distribution of the money.
When you look at rural development, it is obvious that it has been redistributed in accordance with the money available in the rural development budget for the various Member States, which de facto gives an advantage to the new Member States.
It is also important to see this injection of money as a one-off.
In rural development it is simply going to cover the gap that we have in 2009 because the Health Check only enters into force on 1 January 2010 and therefore we found ourselves in a situation where we had no money to meet the new challenges.
Those challenges are quite in line with my dear colleague Mr Piebalgs's ideas on renewable energy in the rural areas, using new technologies, using waste from the agricultural sector to contribute to the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, climate change, water, biodiversity and the challenges that we are now facing in the dairy sector in Europe.
Finally, I completely agree that broadband is an advantage, not only for the agricultural sector but also for everybody.
However, it is very important that we secure a link to the broadband network in rural areas to encourage small and medium-sized companies and to make it easier for people to move out and still use their computers, maybe one or two days a week, to take care of a job that might be in the city.
So broadband is one of the issues for the future.
In general, and in conclusion, I think there has been broad support and I hope that the investment we are going to make in this one-off payment will prove to be well spent.
<D>
(EL) Mr President, this year's budget is resounding proof that the Community method works.
This year we have demonstrated the added value that the European Union can provide in resolving complex problems where the original plans failed.
This is borne out not only by the spectacular success of Galileo, but also by the way in which we were able to provide Frontex with new, necessary funding to meet new challenges; and by the pilot schemes, and the European Institute of Technology.
Simply put, the European Union shows that it can provide Community solutions to large-scale, complex problems where others have failed.
This is the first positive message.
However, there is another, negative message connected with the broader trend of the budget figures: the fact that this year we are spending, for next year, 0.95% of the Community GDP does not strike me as good news.
I have heard that some fellow Members regard it as a success.
For me it is not.
It proves that we are spending as much now, with 27 Member States, as we were when there were 15.
Budgets at this level do not represent the scale of ambition of the European enterprise.
Building on this year's success, we should start preparing the future allocations in good time, and I am glad that discussion of this has already begun.
Let me end on a personal note: on Thursday when we vote on the budget, it will be a year since Loyola de Palacio - the architect of this great European project - passed away.
A great European, a great woman, a woman who initiated this process, the successful conclusion of which we shall be voting through on Thursday.
I believe that for a politician who speaks through her work, there can be no better memorial.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - I shall start by describing what the situation looked like just a few years ago.
We all remember that the dairy sector was very stable with very few price fluctuations, but over the last few years the situation has changed dramatically.
Firstly in 2007, I remember clearly in August and September, we saw huge increases in dairy prices and then we experienced last year the same or an even worse reduction in prices, so the situation today is that prices are very close to intervention prices and in some parts of Europe even below intervention.
I can assure Members that I am extremely concerned at the quick deterioration of the European dairy market.
We have support measures in place that can be activated to support the dairy sector and we have already taken action.
Contrary to the normal situation, where the private storage scheme for butter is normally activated on 1 March, we have decided to activate the scheme from 1 January, which means that the production that has taken place in December is also eligible for this scheme.
Intervention buying or granting export refunds are other instruments that are available to support the dairy sector or the dairy market efficiently.
With regard to the intervention system starting in March - and therefore also covering the production that will take place in February - butter and skimmed milk powder may be purchased until the end of August.
First, for fixed quantities at fixed prices, followed then by a tendering system should the situation so require.
I would also like to remind you of the situation back in 2007.
I think we all remember the immediate and quick reaction that was witnessed by the European Parliament, by the Council, by Member States, that put enormous pressure on me to increase immediately - yesterday rather than tomorrow - to increase the quotas to ease the situation on consumer prices.
I would also like to speak out very clearly today to try to stamp out misunderstandings which are circulating that the increase in milk quotas is to be blamed for the very weak dairy prices that we see today.
The reality is that despite the 2% quota increase that took place after April this year, the production of milk has actually fallen.
That is what we see now, due to the fact that an increase in quotas is a possibility for Member States or for farmers to produce but it is certainly not an obligation.
This shows clearly that dairy producers are reacting to market signals.
The relatively small changes that we have seen in the quota system can therefore in no way explain the market volatility that we are seeing.
The lower demand from consumers is probably a reaction to the high prices that we saw last year as consumers then tried or wanted to step out of the high-quality high-priced dairy products.
Then, of course, there is the economic climate in which we find ourselves these days.
For the same reason it is important that we do not fool ourselves and think that by micro-managing the dairy market we decide for the whole sector.
The conclusion must be that the quota system has not been able to deliver market stability in the market place.
Concerning the question of the Azores, the Portuguese authorities have used any opportunity to ask for increased milk quotas for the islands because of the fact that the Azores seem to be extremely competitive and seem to be benefiting from the increased production.
I am quite sure that the larger quotas, and the ultimate end of the quota system, will benefit the Azores' dairy sector.
That will be the case, I think, even in spite of the fact that those beautiful islands are quite remote and milk has to be moved around between nine islands.
To conclude, I can assure Members that I will manage our dairy policy instruments in a responsible way with a view to ensuring an effective safety net for the dairy sector.
<D>
in writing. - (DE) I support Parliament's decision to introduce the option of the citizens' initiative for the citizens of the EU.
The new EU-wide petition system is an important means of allowing citizens to become more involved and will ensure more direct democracy.
The Treaty on European Union as a whole improves the democratic functioning of the Union.
Citizens can participate in the democratic life of the Union and approach the Commission directly.
The citizens' initiative gives citizens a right of initiative similar to that of the European Parliament and the Council.
In order to ensure that the citizens' initiative is implemented correctly, at least one million signatures are needed from a minimum of one fifth of all the Member States.
In addition, Parliament recommends measures in its resolution which will make the citizens' initiative easier to use.
For example, the Commission should consider using the existing programmes which promote mobility and active citizenship, as well as new forms of communication, such as social networking, which encourage public debate.
I welcome the fact that the representations and offices in the Member States will act as interfaces and advisory bodies.
<D>
Mr President, it is my privilege to represent the handsome villages, the rolling downs and the bluebell groves of the English Home Counties.
Like every other MEP for South-East England, I have received dozens of heartbreaking complaints from constituents who have suffered from the arbitrary confiscation of legally purchased alcohol and tobacco at the Channel ports.
Labour's repeated hikes in the excise duty have served to drive income that ought to be coming to retailers in my constituency across the Channel.
In time, jobs have also been pushed from the English Home Counties across the water.
Revenue that ought to be coming to the British Exchequer is instead going to Continental treasuries.
The Government's response has then been to spend this dwindling income stream on hiring more and more excise officers in a futile attempt to police a system wherein most of our alcohol and tobacco had now become smuggled.
That is the system which, to their shame, Labour MEPs have just voted to go back to.
I think it is a disgrace.
<D>
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FR) Mr President, regarding the report by Mrs Sudre, with my Group's support I tabled a number of amendments as part of a compromise.
These amendments have been partially fulfilled.
I would like to thank the Committee.
The amendments concerned recognition of the added value of the outermost regions in the fields of space, renewable energies, energy self-sufficiency and biodiversity, the importance of public service for the development of the ORs, acknowledgement of the lack of integration of the ORs into the European Research Area, recognition of the benefit of the NET-BIOME programme, and the ORs' ability to make a significant contribution to established international priorities.
On the other hand, I am disappointed that this report has not fully integrated the social and cultural chapter for comprehensive development and that support and recognition of the regional languages of the ORs, funding of research into slavery and colonialism, and the defence of the rights of the native peoples of Guyana were not kept.
I am also disappointed that the report makes no significant commitment to strengthen research capability so that it matches potential.
I am disappointed that my proposal for regulation of postal and telecommunications pricing between the national territories and the ORs was not upheld.
As part of my assessment, I am disappointed that my request for a social and environmental impact study of the CMO in sugar and bananas was rejected.
However, I voted in favour of this report, which certainly provides valuable information and results for the ORs.
<D>
Madam President, before I make my point, I would just like to make a comment to my colleague, Mr Martin.
Whilst he has some very valid points to make, in his scattergun approach he should not try and take out an honest, decent and good man like Mr Bösch, who in my experience of his chairmanship of the Committee on Budgetary Control - even though we might disagree on many points - is exactly what I have described him as.
My concern with OLAF's problem is that it has a huge conflict of interests going on.
It is not necessarily OLAF itself, but the strange relationship whereby it is part of the Commission, even though it is occasionally called upon to investigate that body.
That is why I am concerned that OLAF, which was born following the 1999 'Wise Men's' report - and that report called for it to be independent of the Commission - spends less and less of its time investigating internal Commission matters.
Certainly some of its other investigations are very sexy and exciting, but I am not convinced that Mrs Gräßle's report addresses the problems of OLAF's independence in this way.
Finally, I am concerned that there is another level of conflict of interests.
Should OLAF members of staff be allowed to have relatives working in parts of the EU institutions that they might be investigating?
Indeed, should we not - this Parliament that has banned spouses from working for MEPs - now extend this call to say that only one family member should work in any of the EU institutions to prevent such future conflicts of interests?
<D>
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FR) Madam President, the only thing we will agree on is the urgent need to revolutionise the WTO.
The WTO, like the IMF, is an illegitimate, anti-democratic and dangerous organisation as far as the people's interests are concerned.
It was initially set up to ensure the financial and industrial hegemony of the United States and major transnational groups.
The Union has, of course, slavishly put itself at the beck and call of this system, in the hope of gathering a few crumbs from the table of the American master.
This unbridled free trade has today turned against its founders and the planet's centre of economic gravity has swung towards the East and Asia in particular, resulting in the most terrible financial and food crises the world has ever experienced.
There are few countries that yesterday were classed as emerging nations, went on to become predators and then renounced their role as predators in the name of some benevolent objective or another, with the entire global trading system built around the WTO encouraging them to continue along that path.
The rules for all players are to get rich as quickly as possible, irrespective of the means, including speculation on medicines or basic foodstuffs.
In the Union the inequalities have exploded and the working and middle classes are getting poorer and poorer.
The food crisis affecting the poorest populations is a direct consequence of the WTO's policy aimed at destroying subsistence crops to the benefit of export crops.
Biofuels are merely the easy scapegoat of a mercenary system that must be revolutionised as soon as possible.
I want to take this opportunity to denounce the irresponsible comments of Mr Mandelson, who called for further deregulation of the agricultural markets at a time when the World Food Programme is highlighting the surge in food prices and calling it, and I quote, 'a silent tsunami threatening to plunge more than 100 million people into hunger'.
Does Mr Mandelson thus want to go down in history under the shameful epithet of someone who was responsible for starvation?
The WTO must therefore be revolutionised in order to curb speculation and support producers rather than a minority of profiteers benefiting the global financial markets, so as to encourage the populations to become independent in terms of food and industry and to urge the nations to cooperate rather than compete.

on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate is the first outcome of the Temporary Committee on Climate Change, which we wished to set up in order to have a forum for the development of an effective policy ensuring a close link between adaptation and mitigation.
We are talking here specifically about adaptation, but we should not in fact forget the need to ensure that the resources for adaptation derive partly from the emissions trading system.
Since it is the poorest countries that bear the greatest burden of climate change, we must see to it that the proceeds from the emissions trading system are placed first and foremost at the disposal of developing countries.
I believe we can do so by applying a principle of general equity, namely by handing out free rights of emission, to be established essentially on the basis of an equity principle: 'one person, one right of emission'.
If we think of the one and a half billion poor people in the world and the figures now quoted in the current Kyoto Protocol - approximately €20 per tonne - the granting of a right of emission amounting, for example, to one tonne could make €30 billion per year available to the world's poor for mitigation measures.
Just think, this might be what is needed by Bangladesh to implement minimal mitigation measures.
Certain African states are already thinking along these lines, and this principle of equity also indicates that we, the countries primarily responsible for the phenomenon, are shouldering our responsibility for carrying mitigation forward.
Furthermore, climate change in our own countries means more intense rainfall, longer dry spells and less snowfall.
We must therefore practise integrated land management to protect the soil, and here I would emphasise the importance of what Mr Sacconi said, because in circumstances of widespread water shortages, rain must be kept where it falls so that it can water the lower slopes.
In addition, longer dry spells increase the likelihood of fires, which we can address by thinning out woodland to minimise the fire load.
However, we must act on all fronts at once in a consistent and determined fashion.
<D>
(BG) In the past 48 hours, there have been three contract killings in Sofia, Bulgaria.
Since Roumen Petkov, the current Minister of Interior, took office, a total of 22 contract killings of business people, mafia bosses and politicians have been carried out in Bulgaria.
Not a single one has been solved, not a single person has been convicted.
On Monday, in the bright of day, writer Georgi Stoev was murdered.
He authored several books of investigations into organised crime.
In the meantime it has emerged that Minister Petkov had been in communication with criminal elements on a regular basis and even met with such individuals.
These facts are a clear indication of the complete merging of government and mafia.
What I am saying is that Bulgaria's Interior Minister is a mafia guy.
During the pre-accession period, the Bulgarian people were told that the Union would be a safeguard to ensure success against banditism and killings, a guardian of stability and security, for a life free of crime.
Today, when anyone of us could become the next victim, the Union needs to act in order to clear away this shameful sore.
Not only off Bulgaria but off itself.
<D>
(DE) Madam President, 15 years after the Dayton Agreement, Bosnia and Herzegovina has made a certain amount of limited progress, but has really not come very far.
We should not therefore deceive ourselves about this.
People often say that the Dayton Agreement is fundamentally all right, that it just needs to be applied properly and that better politicians must be found, but this is not true.
The current structure of Bosnia and Herzegovina is not fully functional.
The country must be transformed into a true federation made up of three peoples with equal rights.
Instead of the many small, inflexible cantons, it must be organised into larger, more efficient regions of mixed nationalities.
The central bodies of the state must, of course, also be strengthened and the minorities must be given basic human rights and their position must be reinforced, as the judgment of the court in Strasbourg stated.
Therefore, root and branch reform of the state is required.
However, this reform must be initiated by forces within the country itself.
We can only offer them support.
This is where the major problem lies.
It is not just Mr Dodik, but it is mainly Mr Dodik who is blocking every attempt at genuine reform.
This means that we must do everything possible to encourage the development of a young political elite within the country.
I welcome the fact that one of the areas which Mrs Pack's excellent report focuses on is culture and education.
This country needs a complete education system which is worthy of its great history, from multinational nurseries through to a new European university.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is a country which was not only characterised by conflict, but also by highly exemplary tolerance.
This is where a tolerant European form of Islam has developed.
This is where, during the Austrian era, the first Islamic law in Europe was enacted, which remains an example to this day.
Many people in this country were able to live together peacefully.
The Bosnians can be proud of their history and if they can develop something of the same spirit again and bring it into a modern Europe, I believe that 2010 could be a positive turning point for Bosnia and Herzegovina.
<D>
(PL) Mr President, the European Council to be held on 11 and 12 December will sum up a fruitful Swedish Presidency.
I would like to congratulate the minister and the entire government, because they finalised the very difficult ratification process.
Secondly, implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon is beginning.
It also introduces new institutions, such as President of the European Council and High Representative for Foreign Policy.
We know that these appointments have caused discussion and controversy, including here in this Chamber.
We wish the nominees well, but we would like to say that the real test will be, amongst others, the quality of Eastern policy and the process of setting up the European External Action Service.
We regret, however, that there is no one in the team who would represent Central and Eastern Europe.
I think another reshuffle could certainly fulfil this requirement in the future.
The Copenhagen Climate Summit is to approve, among other things, the ambitious objectives which have been put forward by the European Union.
This, too, is a matter for the forthcoming Council.
So is the Stockholm Programme, which is important from the point of view of security, and the citizens, and the new provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon.
In addition, there is everything connected with the economic crisis.
Our expectations connected with the introduction of the Treaty of Lisbon are, above all, a more efficient EU, able to carry out further enlargement and bringing benefits both to citizens and Member States.
We expect the Treaty of Lisbon to bring a new start to the common market by eliminating the gulf between political and economic integration.
We would also like appointment of the new European Commission to be done with respect for the European Parliament and its rights, as well as implementation of the new role for national parliaments while preserving the principle of subsidiarity, and discussion of how to build Europe after Lisbon.
However, practical implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon means an acknowledgement that solidarity and energy policy are also matters governed by current legislation, such as the regulation on security of gas supply.
<D>
(EL) Madam President, Commissioner, it is not just Olympic Airways that owes money to the state.
The state also owes money to Olympic Airways, a very large amount.
In total, Olympic Airways is demanding more than EUR 1 billion from the Greek state.
I would like to ask you whether the Commission intends to wait for, and especially to respect, the final judicial decisions by the Greek courts having jurisdiction.
I am informed that next week you are to meet with the responsible Greek Minister with whom you will be discussing these matters.
Can you outline for us which points you agree on and where you disagree with the Greek Government on this subject?
In Greece there is considerable concern, and a significant section of public opinion blames the Commission for liquidating Olympic Airways while it was still in operation, for a token price, for the benefit of its competitors.
What reply can you give on this subject?
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, first of all I would like to thank all of you for all your valuable comments.
I think that we see the complexity of this issue from the comments delivered here today.
I would just like to make a few comments.
First of all, I am convinced that what is now proposed - which I would describe as a big carrot for the sector - will work.
The carrot is quite attractive because we now give farmers the possibility of getting 10% of the restructuring fund, and the restructuring fund for the year 2008/09 is EUR 625.
EUR 62.5 plus the top-up that we pay from the restructuring money - EUR 237.5 - comes to EUR 300 per tonne that the farmers send back to the Commission.
What I consider the most important thing is that, for the first time, farmers can trigger the restructuring fund.
This has not been possible before.
Previously it was only the industry.
Now farmers can say 'I want to leave and I want my EUR 300 per tonne, and I get the compensation for the reduction in prices on top of that'.
And that is not a one-off payment: that continues.
I completely agree with Mr Parish.
I think that the alternative to sugar beet production is much more attractive now than it has been for decades, with the cereal prices, with the oil-seed prices.
Therefore, I presume that farmers will make their calculations and look at the bottom line of the most attractive way of arranging their future production.
I mentioned retroactivity the first time that I spoke.
Retroactivity is there so that those who have delivered from the very beginning will not be punished; they will be compensated.
It is for beet growers, for inulin syrup producers and for chicory growers.
So there is no difference between the various types of beet production.
So I am confident, and I am very thankful for the quick reaction from Parliament, which I hope will allow us to find a political agreement in the Council tomorrow so we can send a clear signal to the sector, to the beet growers, so they can start planning their next production season.
I am quite sure that this will be to the benefit of the whole sector because, as was also mentioned here today, the alternative to not using this possibility will be a linear cut with no compensation.
So I am quite sure that lots of calculations will take place on the various farms and areas where this may be attractive, to deliver the tonnes that we need to find the right balance in our sugar sector.
Once again, thank you very much - especially to the rapporteur, Ms Batzeli - for all the work done on this difficult dossier.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, in March 2009, Parliament voted on the novel foods proposal at first reading.
Many of the amendments that were carried have been incorporated into the Council position that was adopted at first reading in March 2010.
The Council position maintains the principle of the need for pre-market authorisation for innovative products to reassure consumers that new production techniques are safe for humans and animals and respect both the interests of consumers and the environment.
The proposed procedure would streamline and speed up the authorisation process through a centralised food safety evaluation undertaken by EFSA, and would set precise deadlines at every stage of the process.
It also includes an improved safety assessment to allow safe traditional food from third countries to enter the EU more easily.
I am grateful for Parliament's broad support for the improvement of the proposal to streamline the authorisation procedure.
Turning to nanomaterials, I underline that the Commission is considering the EP's request for the systematic labelling of all food containing nanomaterials with a favourable disposition.
However, before finalisation of the text, we need to come to an agreement on the adaptation to the new provisions of the Lisbon Treaty, especially those regarding the necessary adaptations of the definition of nanomaterials.
I am confident that a balanced solution can be found so that the improved text can be finalised in a timely manner.
Regarding animal cloning, I share the importance that Parliament attaches to this highly sensitive issue.
As Members will recall, I am committed to producing a report considering all aspects of cloning for food production by November 2010, which will be followed by legislative proposals if appropriate.
I am committed to looking at all issues, especially those relating to the health and welfare of cloned animals during their productive life and natural lifespan.
The impact that any measures on cloning would have on international trade is also a key aspect which will be addressed in this report.
I will view the conclusions of this report with an open mind, with a view to identifying a satisfactory and proportionate solution that can be implemented effectively.
The report will act as a launching point for subsequent discussions, with the aim of reaching an outcome satisfactory to all institutions.
Finally, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Liotard, and the shadow rapporteurs, for their valuable work on this important legislative file.
I look forward to hearing the views of the Members.
<D>
(PL) Mr President, for the period 2008-2012 the European Commission has allocated Poland the right to emit only 208 million tonnes of carbon dioxide.
That is almost 30% less than the amount the Polish Government applied for.
Poland has appealed against this decision to the European Court of Justice, but unfortunately it is not known when in the future the Court will rule on the matter.
The Polish economy therefore has to adjust to the low limit set.
Cement works, steel works and other undertakings have to cut their production.
Most importantly, there will be a marked rise in the cost of electricity.
It is estimated that prices will rise by approximately 10% this year and by 20% over four years, because the emission limits have also significantly affected the electricity-generating industry.
Imposing emission limits in this way, and sharing the burden involved unfairly, will not only slow down the development of new Member States such as Poland, but it will also impact significantly on the cost of living for their citizens.
I wish to register a strong protest against this.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, honourable Members, Ms de Brún, let me start by thanking you very much for the excellent work on the evaluation of the PEACE programme and also strategies for the future.
The Commission shares with you the opinion that the European Union's interventions in support of the peace process in Northern Ireland have contributed in bringing the two communities closer together and have helped the development of cross-community and cross-border linkages.
The Commission also recognises that peace-building is a long-term and multi-dimensional process and we also recognise that peace-building requires a flexible approach and the willingness to allow for experimentation and the adoption of innovative measures.
But perhaps the most important lesson learned from the PEACE programme is the effectiveness of the bottom-up approach.
This has enabled people and organisations working on the ground to tackle the problems and issues faced by the communities at local level.
It has brought people from both communities together and given them, very importantly, a sense of ownership of, and the responsibility for, the peace process.
Targeting those most affected by the conflict is important, but the projects dealing with young people, our future, have been equally important in changing attitudes and perceptions.
Last but not least we have learned that the projects in support of women are essential since the role of women in peace-building and promoting reconciliation is a key factor in bringing stability and durability to the process.
The Commission also considers that the experience of the EU interventions in Northern Ireland and the peace-building initiatives should indeed be recorded with the objective of passing on good practice to other areas of the world, emerging from conflict or facing similar problems of social integration.
I know that Northern Ireland is actively working on the establishment of a centre for conflict resolution and they have my support in taking this forward.
Allow me also to mention the successful Northern Ireland workshop during the Open Days in October last year.
Indeed, not only was the event fully booked but it generated a network which is currently being set up for sharing experience on peace and reconciliation.
It will also be followed up by a workshop during this year's Open Days, in early October.
I shall stop here.
I thank you for your excellent report and shall now listen to Parliament's debate.
<D>
in writing. - (GA) The European population is ageing and it will not be long now until the age group '55 years old or older' will be the largest age group in the EU.
Although there are four people of working age for every person over 65 at present, the ratio will be half that by the year 2050.
I voted in favour of this timely report.
Although it is the responsibility of the individual Member States to decide pension matters, the EU and the Member States must work together to develop a definite, sustainable and financially viable system.
The workforce of today is especially mobile; therefore it is imperative that pensions can be transferred from one Member State to another.
The pension systems must be brought up to date so that they are flexible, transparent and accessible.
Information must be provided regarding the options available and the various aspects of different pension types.
I support what is in the report about placing more emphasis on financial education and about encouraging awareness of saving for a pension.
<D>
(HU) Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen.
I would like to begin by thanking Mrs Stavreva for her cooperation and to congratulate her for her excellent work which received the unanimous support of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
Following the debate held in the Council, we have EUR 1.02 billion available to us to alleviate the painful impact of the crisis on rural areas.
We have successfully reached a situation where the money can be used in a much more flexible way compared to the original proposal, within a suitably broad framework, to develop broadband Internet access in rural areas and to tackle the new challenges defined during the review of the common agricultural policy.
Member States' rural development plans must be reviewed as quickly as possible so that the amounts now specified can be made available as soon as possible.
This is perhaps the most important aspect for the rural population as with the help of these developments, new jobs, new training courses and new markets may become accessible, resulting at the same time in a reduction in costs and the deployment of new innovative technologies.
The rural population are the most vulnerable victims of the economic crisis.
In fact, looking at the future, it can be said that there is also the risk of further territorial and economic exclusion, extending beyond the economic crisis.
Even before the crisis broke, a large number of Member States had to face continual decline in rural areas.
Our responsibility is to devise and implement as soon as possible the necessary measures aimed at safeguarding our rural values.
Fellow Members, given that my party is not expected to do well enough in the elections for me to continue working for the next five years among you, I would therefore also like to thank you for the excellent cooperation which I have enjoyed in this House.
As a young politician, I can only wish every young politician the chance to learn in such an excellent organisation how European politics works.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, many thanks to you, Claude.
You held a great many meetings on this topic.
It is a very complex issue and I would like to thank you particularly for being so consistently transparent throughout these negotiations and for making it possible for us to look at the project from a holistic perspective.
The challenge worldwide nowadays is to think about efficiency, in energy consumption, but also in production.
However, this cannot only apply to the macro level; we must always be guided by the maxim 'think small first': look at the micro level first, and if it works there, it will work at the macro level too.
We must focus on ensuring that we apply the best available technology that exists globally.
This can be simple, clearly structured technology; it does not need to be electronics and nanotechnology.
We have to try and make this technology financially accessible, as far as possible, so that everyone can afford to use it.
On the other hand, of course, we also have to penalise those who squander our Earth's resources.
This is a major challenge for our Commissioner as well, to look at the global structures: punishing those who waste energy and rewarding those who operate using the best and most efficient technologies.
This is a core principle in climate policy as well.
Studies in the European Union show that the costs of climate change will run into billions and billions of euro.
That is why it is essential not only to do something for countries outside Europe; the Council should also be thinking about providing new funding for research and development in the field of energy efficiency, especially in the new European Institute of Technology.
<D>
in writing. - (ES) Having had my speech interrupted by the President, who applied speaking time much more strictly to me than to the colleagues before me, I wish to add a few comments.
We certainly ought to be pleased with the determination of the institutions in overcoming all the ups and downs of the project.
We are finally in a position to initiate guaranteed planning for Galileo's deployment phase.
We are also extremely pleased with the work carried out to make participation in the programme as broad as possible.
Having said this, I now wish to mention one vital point: the civil nature of the project, an essential condition to ensure the transparency of operations.
The European system's independence will enable certification to be issued for the services supplied to users, and will furnish guaranteed quality.
These conditions are essential in the development of new commercial applications ushering in a wonderful opportunity for our SMEs, with huge environmental and social potential.
Navigation for the blind, planning the most accessible routes for the disabled, assistance for those suffering from Alzheimer's disease, or rapid location of people in emergency situations are all examples of applications geared towards improving lifestyles.
The EP has always given its full support to Galileo through legislative and budgetary undertakings, and has clearly acknowledged it as a strategic project.
<D>
The resolution on equality between women and men in the European Union seems completely balanced to me, and I welcome the work carried out by Mr Tarabella to achieve this outcome.
Flagrant inequalities between men and women still exist today in the employment sector, particularly when it comes to differences in pay or even reconciling work and family life.
There are still efforts to be made in this area.
Moreover, with regard to the protection of sexual and reproductive rights, it is essential that women have access to contraception and abortion.
Women must be able to have full physical autonomy.
That is why I voted in favour of the measures relating to the protection of these rights.
Finally, I voted against the proposal to create a European charter of women's rights because, since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which includes women's rights, forms an integral part of the treaties.
This charter is legally binding and enables women to be protected in the same way as men.
<D>
Mr President, this financial crisis is a wake-up call for all of us and also for Commissioner McCreevy.
Only a few months ago Mr McCreevy assured us that the talk about financial risks and crises was theoretical and we would never run into new bubbles.
Now we have just been confronted with one, which has serious consequences, according to today's Financial Times, the OECD and other qualified institutions.
I have four questions for Mr McCreevy.
Firstly, if we look at the derivatives - credit derivatives, credit market - you blame the agencies and say that they are not good enough; I say that we do not know anything about what is going on.
Are you ready now to propose a public classification of the complex derivatives in such a way that the public and private agencies can give us guidance on the risk connected to them?
Because that is impossible today.
My second question is about the conflict of interest.
If we take the prime brokers, the hedge funds and private equity funds, we see that they are mixed up in a complex set of interests: they earn income from each other, they trade with each other and we do not know what is going on.
Are you ready now to introduce rules of transparency, disclosure and accountability which give us a real chance of regulating the market?
My third question concerns pension funds.
We know that wage-earners and workers are having losses connected to putting money into hedge-fund speculating in this derivative market.
Are you ready to introduce rules which can protect the pension funds and insurance companies trying to administer wage-earners' money in the future so that they have an interest in saving and knowing that the losses are limited?
My final question is: how can you defend the fact that the hedge funds, private equity and investment banks are the last resort on the international and financial markets without any regulations?
We have the usage to regulate the banks and the mutual funds, why should they - hedge funds, private equity, investment banks - be the last resort?
I cannot explain it, you cannot explain it.
It is time to put the common interests at the front, and that is why we need regulation.
(Applause)
<D>
Mr President, I want to make a point on Ms Martens' report.
Firstly, let me say that the Lisbon Treaty is not a train wreck and it is nonsense to be saying that.
Twenty-six of the twenty-seven Member States of the European Union will ratify or have ratified it, and that includes the British Parliament.
It is a pity that British Members do not respect their own parliament in some of the comments they are making here.
The Irish people expressed certain concerns about some issues, and the Irish Government and Parliament are seeking clarification on those.
If we get those clarifications and the people vote 'yes' in a second referendum later this year, will they come in here with their leprechaun hats and perform in the same outrageous manner that they did at the previous one?
Leave Irish business to Ireland.
We do not need any assistance in this from people it took us 700 years to get out of our country!
Concerning the Lisbon Treaty, let me say that the population of the European Union will be 6% of the world's population within the next generation.
China and all of those countries will be very powerful.
<D>
rapporteur. - (DA) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, citizens of the EU, this report is the result of extensive work in the Committee on Petitions, involving Members from all political groups.
I would like to thank both the Chairman and the shadow rapporteurs for their sterling work.
As draftsman of the committee's opinion, I have personally been wholeheartedly committed to this matter.
It has, of course, had a huge effect on the lives of tens of thousands of EU citizens living in Spain and has affected both the Spanish countryside and the Spanish economy.
The report has now been approved by the committee after being adopted by a two-thirds majority.
It is a comprehensive text, which differentiates between the many different aspects of Spanish urbanisation.
There is the problem of the fundamental rights of European citizens, which include the right to lawfully acquired property.
The European Parliament has already committed itself to respecting these rights, and all Member States are bound by them.
There is the problem of the disastrous impact of the extensive urbanisation on the environment, particularly in coastal areas and on the Spanish islands, but also in other areas such as around Madrid.
There is the problem of the resurrection of the Spanish 1988 Coastal Law, which is now suddenly able to deny many people the right to live in their own homes - and in certain cases has even resulted in the demolition of these homes.
Then there is the problem of the consequences of thousands of allegedly unlawful houses built with the approval of the municipalities but subsequently declared unlawful, whereby the innocent purchaser becomes the victim of corrupt urbanisation practices.
Finally, there is the problem of the lack of legal certainty and appropriate compensation for the victims of the property scandals.
I have no doubt about where the responsibility for these extensive infringements lies and I regret that these violations by municipal and regional authorities have undermined attempts by many others to create sustainable development, where a healthy economy goes hand in hand with respect for the environment and for cultural heritage.
The report deserves a proper debate in which all opinions can be heard.
It is unacceptable that our new rules prevent this.
These rules must be changed as soon as possible, particularly when it comes to reports that deal with complaints from European citizens.
I ask you to reject the two alternative resolutions.
Although they are based on my report, they are not impartial.
They do not reflect the detailed and factual assessments that the committee has voted on.
<D>
Ladies and gentlemen, following Hungary's ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon, Slovenia and Malta ratified the Treaty yesterday.
(Applause)
The Slovenian Parliament voted by a large majority for ratification.
The Maltese Parliament, for its part, unanimously approved the Treaty.
This is an important political signal whereby Member States have shown clearly that they want the ratification process to proceed rapidly so that the Treaty can enter into force as planned on 1 January 2009.
I congratulate Slovenia and Malta on this landmark decision.
(Applause)
For domestic reasons, as you know, the Slovakian Parliament decided yesterday to postpone its vote until a later date.
I appeal to all political leaders in Slovakia to fulfil their great political responsibility.
<D>
One of the strategic areas defined in the Beijing Platform for Action is that of the rights of women as an inalienable, integral and indivisible part of universal human rights.
The objective is to fully introduce international instruments for the protection of these rights, including the Convention on Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.
One form of discrimination is violation of the reproductive rights of women.
A report on respect for reproductive rights in Poland in 2007 and the recommendations of the UN Human Rights Committee which are based on this report show clearly that Polish women have difficulties in gaining access to reimbursable contraception, medical care during pregnancy, prenatal tests and even to pain-free labour.
They are denied the possibility of a legal abortion in practically every case, even in cases which are permissible under law.
As a result, 200-400 legal terminations of pregnancy are performed in Poland every year, compared to 100 000 illegal ones.
I propose adoption of a legal abortion rate, calculated as the number of legal terminations of pregnancy per 1 000 live births per year, as a measure of the equality of women in Member States of the EU.
In countries where women have the right to choose abortion, this rate fluctuates at around 200.
In Poland, it is 1.
This is an objective measure of the violation of women's reproductive rights in Poland.
I appeal for more effective cooperation between the EU and the UN over monitoring of women's rights and the introduction of measurements which quantify violations of women's rights.
<D>
The construction sector is one with tremendous energy saving potential.
The sector is responsible for 40% of energy consumption and 35% of total greenhouse gas emissions.
Improving the energy efficiency of buildings is the most effective way of reducing energy consumption and emissions.
This agreement deserves our full support.
By 31 December 2020 at the latest, all new buildings must be nearly zero energy.
All public sector buildings must achieve this two years earlier.
Minimum energy performance requirements will even apply from now on when older buildings are renovated.
Nearly zero energy buildings are buildings with very high energy performance.
In addition, the negligible or very small amount of energy they consume should originate, to a very large extent, from renewable energy sources.
It is to be welcomed that the directive devotes attention to the provision of funding instruments to enable this transition.
The Member States must draw up a list of measures for achieving the objectives of this directive by 30 June 2011 at the latest.
Finally, the Commission must assess the functioning of the directive in good time; that is, by 1 January 2017 at the latest.
This directive represents an important contribution to the fight against climate change.
<D>
rapporteur. - Madam President, can I first of all say that my colleague Mr Vidal-Quadras sends his apologies?
He is not able to take up his slot.
He has urgent business elsewhere, but he asked me to say - which was very nice of him - that the two of us agree that I will speak on behalf of our group.
I would like to pick up one or two points that have come up in the debate.
The first is the colleague who expressed concern that we will end up with a concentration of power in very few utilities.
Should that happen, the Commission possesses powers under the competition rules to address that, and we have precedent in other parts of the world, including the United States, where they have tackled entrenched monopoly or dominant market power.
So that is the ultimate resort, should this legislation fail.
Should we come back for a fourth package?
I have to remind the Commissioner that I urged upon him caution in embarking upon the third package: that it would be better to wait and see what the second package achieved once it was implemented.
I think now we must allow time for this package to be transposed: to implement it and see how it works before deciding whether anything is needed.
I have to say that my disappointment about our lack of success in tackling ownership unbundling is offset by my optimism about the possibility of the Agency imaginatively using the powers that we have given it to deal with the situation, and I would like to thank my other colleague who demands more power for the energy regulators.
Market forces are already moving in this direction.
Two German utilities are divesting themselves of their transmission systems because they have realised there is better value in doing that.
Finally, could I restate the case for competition?
It means better value and service for consumers, and it means a more efficient use of resources.
That is why it is a good thing to do.
<D>
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, on 26 September 2009, 44 citizens' panels were organised in 38 countries representing the various stages of development.
91% of citizens worldwide believed that there was an urgent need to reach an agreement in Copenhagen, including 93% of Europeans.
89% believed that we needed to go beyond the 25% target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in industrialised countries, and 92% of Europeans follow this line of thinking.
We, the MEPs representing the peoples of Europe, have a duty to use our influence to respond to the request of our fellow citizens, but above all to shoulder the responsibility that we have, so that we can meet the IPCC's target of a 25-40% reduction by 2020.
To achieve this, the target of a 30% reduction must be upheld, as Mr Leinen just said, and obviously with the necessary financial resources, estimated at EUR 100 billion for 2020.
To this end, a tax on financial transactions will probably have to be introduced, as will green technology transfers to the South.
Europe's leadership on this crucial issue for the future must result in an agreement being reached, but not an agreement at any price, in other words, not one that falls short of its objectives, that has no financial resources, controls or constraints.
It would be better to have nothing at all than to have a vague commitment that puts this issue on the back-burner, making people believe that it has been dealt with.
Our responsibility is not only that of being jointly responsible for the climate debt, but of doing everything possible to convince people of the only sensible solution and of being a tireless defender of the fair and effective collective effort.
In this regard, upholding the 30% target means giving all of the countries that have already proposed lower and upper limits for their emissions the means to aim for the upper limits and not to stay at the lower ones.
Everyone will answer to the international public and to future generations for the position they adopt in Copenhagen.
The position of we Europeans must be clear, unambiguous and extremely robust.
<D>
- (FR) Madam President, first of all, I too would obviously like to express my condolences and offer my sympathy firstly to those families who are in mourning, and to all those who are victims, in particular the many who have been cut off and who today still lack electricity, water or public services.
Commissioner, I listened to you promise us - and I think you were right - that crisis prevention measures would be consolidated, but the issue this evening, if I may say so, is compensation for the last crisis.
This is the third catastrophic storm in 20 years.
The first one, as you will remember, was in July 1988, in Brittany.
It still holds the wind speed record: over 250 km/h.
The second, which was on an unprecedented scale, was the storm of 27 December 1999.
It flattened most of our forests, for the first time.
The third storm was on 24 January 2009.
The reason I remember it is that I live in Gironde, very close to the Gironde forests.
The first thing we need to do is ask ourselves what the European Union's added value might be.
In forestry the situation is catastrophic and what threatens us is that foresters have stopped foresting, by which I mean that some of them believe this profession has become unsustainable.
We must therefore put a plan in place, and I am among those who were ready, almost 10 years ago now, to consider a joint crisis organisation, so that we can sell all the wood which has now been placed on the market rather involuntarily, without affecting the price: we could do this by blocking supplies from other European regions, by funding transport and by making sure that this land can be replanted very quickly; otherwise, I think it will become subject to speculation, or even abandoned.
Here we have a problem which is of direct interest to the European Union.
Secondly, I am also thinking of the oyster-farmers.
Today the profession is in dire straits.
It was already in trouble in 2002 after another disaster which was not at all natural, the sinking of the Prestige, and at present the oyster-farmers of the Arcachon Basin are losing all hope of being able to get back on their feet.
Finally, I would like the European Union Solidarity Fund to be mobilised.
Obviously, I sympathise with what Mrs Laperrouze has said.
Today, the Council is not here.
It will do it no harm and I think it is extremely disappointing that it has refused to change the rule and that this fund today is so difficult to mobilise.
I ask you, moreover, whether the French Government itself has mobilised it.
I am among those who will strive to see that it does this, because I believe it is very important, a few months from the elections, that our citizens know that European solidarity does exist and that Europe is not just dominated by the market.
<D>
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that there are no longer any reasons for maintaining any kind of sanctions against Belarus.
There we see a country which is undoubtedly undergoing a crisis, like all the countries of Europe, and in any case it is a country which permits the right to property, a country which until a few months ago was experiencing a growth rate of 8% and which did not prevent foreigners, including Europeans, from buying land or houses, even if this was through Belarusian companies.
Further, with regard to religious freedom, a little while ago Cardinal Bertone went to Belarus and relations of mutual respect were certainly forged between the state of Belarus and the Vatican.
Political liberties, above all, are important, and there has been talk of some prisoners, but in fact this relates to three political prisoners who have been released.
We are also talking about political elections, and certainly there is not the comprehensive freedom that we experience in western elections, but it is certainly true that television time and, in some cases, even contributions have been granted by the state to all the candidates.
We also know that in the next few weeks some newspapers - independent newspapers - will have the opportunity to start up and be distributed.
I think that it is strategically in Europe's interests to open up to Belarus, precisely because Belarus is a very important element between Europe and Russia.
Let us remember that there is a strong Catholic minority, which brings it closer to neighbouring Poland and the rest of Europe and makes the country a strategic ally with regard to the rest of eastern Europe.
It is strange that today there is talk of Turkey's entry into Europe, when Belarus has a much stronger and more significant partnership role with Europe.
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first I want to thank the Commission and the rapporteur for their work.
Freight transport logistics is such a broad subject that it is not always easy to confine oneself to essentials.
As it is put so well in French: 'qui trop embrasse mal étreint'.
So let us be glad that today we have managed to pick out the key points!
We have to tread new ground, because this is not an easy field.
It is an area of conflict between the economy and growth on the one side, and the environment and security on the other.
Put simply: everybody wants the goods, nobody wants the transport.
That means that this sector, which does indeed offer very good employment prospects, does not have a very good image.
We must do our part to remind people firstly that it is an important economic sector, secondly that we can tread new ground, and thirdly that the sector still has employment potential today.
I still regard the reference to training as very important and it should be taken up by the various countries.
Specialisation in these areas can lead to new and interesting jobs.
Research can also help make freight transport more efficient, environmentally compatible and also more secure.
Cooperation among countries remains essential.
We need only think of the Trans-European Networks.
We all think globally, nobody wants to act locally.
To put it simply, we want these networks everywhere, but we do not have the resources, whether we negotiate with the Council to get more funds for the Trans-European Networks or with the countries themselves.
As regards modes of transport, I believe nobody has anything against shifting goods to the railways and inland waterways, but efficiency is the key point.
Efficiency is not just a question of price.
If transport by rail becomes cheaper but not more efficient, we will not achieve that modal shift.
So we must combine efficiency with price if we are to deal with this matter adequately.
Finally, let me raise the subject of megaliners and standardisation.
We cannot prohibit, or even authorise, everything purely at European level.
We should work together properly with the Member States and find directives, for example in the fields of security and infrastructure, that must determine whether or not these megaliners should be tolerated.
<D>
Mr President, I commend this resolution to you.
Indeed, I commend the work of the Parliament's delegation to Geneva where, as well as holding our own EU representatives to account, we work with them to engage in dialogue with countries in other regions of the world, demonstrating Europe's strength and solidarity in upholding human rights and international humanitarian law.
I am grateful for the inclusion of my amendments in the text supporting the call for a special session on violence against women and for the signature and ratification by all our countries of all international human rights instruments.
I call for Europe's support, in particular, for the renewal of the mandate of the Special Representative on Business and Human Rights.
But having just returned from Gaza, I would like to commend to you paragraph 34 in particular.
This is a state of siege, with mediaeval conditions being imposed on the people of Gaza.
Today we will identify it as a clear breach of human rights.
If even Tony Blair cannot get Israel to allow the import of equipment to stop 40 000 litres of untreated human waste poisoning the water supply, it is time for Europe to act.
European troops under a new mandate could help supervise the reopening of the borders and, as I now ask for your support, European countries can achieve agreement on all sides in the UN Human Rights Council to seek enforcement of international humanitarian law.
We, as Europe, can take the initiative, as was suggested by the Slovenian Presidency at our Human Rights Subcommittee in Brussels only last week.
We can propose a balanced text that recognises that both terrorist rocket attacks as well as the collective punishment of the blockade both break the fourth Geneva Convention.
In doing so, we can achieve a consensus in Geneva which can make a real difference to the humanitarian crisis suffered by the people of Gaza.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - I am very glad that you put this question, because I am very proud of one of our achievements, and that is the Covenant of Mayors.
In 2008 we supported the initiative from cities to have a Covenant of Mayors.
This means that cities make a binding obligation to reduce CO2 by more than 20% by 2020.
They develop sustainable energy action plans for this.
They have also founded a Covenant of Mayors' Office for coordination and promotion.
We support these actions through the Joint Research Centre, to provide scientific background and technical support for the preparation, implementation and evaluation of the sustainable energy action plans.
For smaller municipalities, the Commission negotiates with other national, regional and local administrations to ensure their support for the smaller cities.
An advanced system of good practice, the Benchmarks of Excellence, is also intended to be implemented this year.
We have also created a financial support facility through the European Investment Bank (EIB), in which we place the grants, and also use the EIB to target sustainable development in the cities.
The EIB has already been involved in specific projects, such as with Barcelona, on which negotiations are quite advanced.
I know that the City of Cork has not yet signed this Covenant, so it is still up to the City of Cork to use this opportunity.
It is a good way to really mobilise citizens behind these initiatives.
At the same time there are also other instruments for sustainable development, and the cohesion policy provides significant support to cities to implement sustainable energy policies and actions.
In total, for the period 2007-2013, EUR 9 billion from cohesion policy funds will be directly invested in sustainable energy initiatives in the EU.
The Southern and Eastern Operational Programme, which includes the City of Cork, will invest EUR 669 million in the region and contribute to reaching Lisbon growth and jobs objectives.
These cohesion funds will directly support sustainable energy projects in the region, and will help to mobilise further national investment.
Funding may be used to stimulate energy efficiency and renewable energy production, the development of efficient energy management systems and the promotion of clean and sustainable public transport, particularly in urban areas.
The Operational Programme includes the 'Gateway Challenge Fund', which is based on an integrated sustainable development strategy for Cork.
Finally, the Regional Development Fund was recently changed to give all Member States the possibility to use regional funds for energy efficiency improvements and the integration of renewable energy into existing housing.
This can be as much as 4% of the total Regional Fund allocation.
So, to summarise, I believe that we have created a framework for cities that share an ambition to develop sustainable models for their citizens, and that is the Covenant of Mayors.
The Covenant of Mayors includes sympathisers like New York and Rochester, and has participants from other non-EU countries, so it offers a lot of knowledge through the office we operate.
As concerns financial support, we do not at this stage have any programme dedicated to energy efficiency, but we have the Structural Funds, we have an Intelligent Energy Europe programme and we have also the European Investment Bank.
We are using all those instruments to support these initiatives.
The European Investment Bank is very active in this process.
However, at this stage it is not so much an issue of finance, but more about good projects and really dedicated policy from the cities.
That is my answer to your very important question.
I believe that cities have every opportunity to lead the way towards a sustainable energy future.
<D>
The EUR 4.5 billion reduction in the Structural and Cohesion Funds in the EU budget for 2008 justifies our vote against this report.
The Multiannual Financial Framework 2007-2013 has not been observed from the start, particularly with regard to use of cohesion policy funds.
The 'justifications' - such as the delay in adopting and implementing programmes - do not explain why, in two consecutive years, these amounts have either not been included in the EU budget or have subsequently been reduced.
What is more, the EU budget for 2009 includes appropriations for structural and cohesion policy which are lower than those adopted for 2007, and this is in a year of crisis.
If there are difficulties in implementing the operational programmes of each Member State, then these should be overcome (including by increasing the Community co-financing rates).
What is unacceptable is to use these 'difficulties' to reduce amounts which should be used to support productive sectors and to promote employment with rights in the 'cohesion' countries, which include Portugal.
Furthermore, appropriations are being accumulated which will run the risk of not being used due to the application of the n+2 and n+3 rules and due to the difficulties caused by these being partly co-financed by the national budgets of these countries.
<D>
Right from the start, I, as shadow rapporteur for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament for this report, have had serious reservations about the usefulness and the effectiveness of the entry/exit system mentioned in the European Commission's communication.
Implementing such a system, which is directly inspired by the 'US-VISIT' Programme, would mean making huge investments only to see very uncertain results obtained with regard to the fight against both illegal immigration and crime.
This is what the US experiment shows, in any case.
Moreover, the planned measures, which are based on the massive collection of personal data, pose risks to the protection of privacy in my opinion.
This view is shared by the European Data Protection Supervisor.
The adoption of a number of my amendments, which were aimed at highlighting doubts concerning the need and the proportionality of the system and at criticising the culture of suspicion that increasingly pervades decisions relating to external border management, have led me to endorse the report in plenary.
At a time when the global economy is plunged into crisis, there are, without doubt, other priorities for the European budget.
<D>
(PL) Mr President, hopefully we might expect that with time the conflict will sort itself out.
That is the hollowest hope there could be.
New generations are growing up, and the conflict goes on and is even getting worse.
You would think that two nations that are quite close to each other, the Hebrews and the Arabs, could cohabit, but not under the conditions of a hierarchical system.
Every dependence of one upon the other, inequality, and above all the lack of a sovereign state structure for the Arabs, will be constant sources of negative emotions, convictions and retaliation.
If the State of Israel cannot entertain a territorial division, I find it difficult to foresee peace in this area, I am afraid.
Just as the Jews have a right to their country, their state, in the same way the Arabs, the Palestinians, have a right too.
Historically, before World War II, Palestine existed, and as we are seeing, it is not easy to erase it from the Arab memory.
Every day the situation is deteriorating for the people in Gaza to such an extent that explosions of built-up aggression are inevitable, and all we can do is look on in embarrassment and sadness.
The most we can do, for our part - besides trying to calm impulses towards mutual destruction and besides attempts at mediation - is to extend humanitarian assistance to people to enable them to live in as decent sanitary conditions as possible, to have something to eat and somewhere to go to school.
But I emphasise that this is only a substitute for a solution, a solution towards which, we are ashamed to admit, we are not able to lead.
Experience gained in central and eastern Europe in the nineteenth century and the twentieth century horrors of Europe and Africa: these clearly demonstrate the power of a people's striving for independence.
This striving is what we are dealing with there too.
<D>
Mr President, for budget debates, there is a well-known law we call the law of the three 'Ls', because budget debates involve reeling off Litanies, like in a religious Liturgy, which ends up causing economic Lethargy.
We are finding this with the 2008 budget.
The litanies first.
Mr Virrankoski reels off these litanies like Mr Elles did in 2006, and like our fellow Member Mr Garriga Polledo did in 2005.
First of all, the litany of cutting off appropriations: in the draft budget, the Council of Ministers cuts off the appropriations in the preliminary draft budget.
Mr Mulder has explained to us that this is quite normal for agriculture, for example.
The European Parliament, however, is proposing to restore the appropriations.
The litany is also one of a budget consistently below the ceilings of the multiannual financial framework.
The multiannual financial framework is already very short of the necessary appropriations and the budget even more so.
It is a cascade of Malthusianism.
It is also a litany of political priorities: year after year, fighting poverty, education, training, agricultural multifunctionality and the seventh framework programme on research are mentioned, and that is where the liturgy comes in.
The liturgy is primarily in the budgetary nomenclature and the ideology supporting that nomenclature.
The nomenclature is the presentation of the budget by activity, the preparation of the budget by activity.
In practice, the expenditure is chopped up into titles, into political fields, which correspond to the directorates-general.
The budget is like a huge salami, a type of grocer's shop inventory, the problem being, as the rapporteur has seen, that dividing the budget up by activity creates confusion with the multiannual financial framework, which is split into broader categories.
One has five categories: competitiveness, preservation of natural resources, freedom, the EU as a global partner, administration, and the other has about thirty political activities, and the correspondence between these categories is difficult to establish.
All this is done in the name of a budgetary ideology, the ideology of performance, competitiveness, effectiveness, efficiency and results, and this creates a jumble of nebulous tools, results indicators, performance indicators, activities sheets.
This budgetary technology is presented as new, as being in the vanguard of budgetary intelligence, but it is actually something quite old, dating back to 1947.
It was the American Hoover Committee that first talked about the concepts of performance, cost/benefit, efficiency, targets and results.
It was this that gave the US the Planning, Programming and Budgeting System in the 1960s under the Johnson Presidency, and that under President Carter gave the BBZ, or budget base zero - the budgetary performance ideology that subsequently spread to New Zealand, the United Kingdom, France in 2001 with its organic law on finance laws, and even Mexico in 2006.
One might understand from this why the European budget is lacking in transparency and really in efficiency too.
The European Parliament does not contain 100 people capable of understanding the European budget by activity, with the consequence that this entails: the economic lethargy of the European Union.
Because if there is no Galileo, if there is no Lyon-Turin link, if there is no Genoa-Barcelona link, if the capital cities are not connected by high-speed trains, if the research budget is not what it should be, if the budget for a Europe of 27 Member States is the same as the Spanish budget, if the European budget is one twentieth of the budget of the United States, it is precisely because of this Malthusian ideology.
Perhaps it is time we realised that alongside the ordinary budget, we need an extraordinary budget to make loans financed by a major European loan, which would permit investment.
<D>
I voted in favour of adopting this report.
Funding for development cooperation requires well-thought-out regulations, and the report provides a synthesis of what our priorities should be when adopting them.
The goals pursued by the European Union when establishing this instrument are to ensure special EU assistance for developing countries.
In view of our current struggle to cope with the financial crisis, the problems of poorer countries are becoming ever more evident.
The financing instrument for development cooperation is aimed at helping poorer partner countries in the field of trade and regional integration, the natural environment and the management of natural resources, infrastructure, water and energy, rural development, agriculture and food security, human development and social cohesion.
Furthermore, we want to support the development of government systems, democracy, human rights and also economic and institutional reforms, and to prevent conflicts and weakening of the state.
All the abovementioned goals are of the utmost importance in terms of strengthening security in poorer regions.
Helping other countries to construct stable democratic societies in countries governed by the rule of law, where human rights are observed and freedom of speech is guaranteed, with a solid judicial system, territorial defence and armed forces, is a commendable plan.
I hope that we will succeed in putting it into effect on a wider scale, making even more efficient use of funds.
<D>
Mr President, I welcome the excellent report on the European Parliament's role in election observations.
Election observations in new and developing democracies are rightly seen as a priority of the EU and a demonstration of its commitment to these nations.
However, I see a further role for our Member States, for our so-called 'mature democracies', and this is leading by example.
I recall a heated debate in Poland prior to the general election of October 2007.
The OSCE wanted to deploy a small team of observers.
This request was initially met with a negative reaction by many politicians who saw this as an affront and insult.
Not so.
Observation missions have been deployed to many old European democracies.
The French presidential election is just one example.
Ultimately, observers were made welcome in Poland.
When convincing reluctant emerging or new democracies to allow international observers in, we must show that we ourselves allow others to scrutinise us.
Our electoral processes are not without problems.
The British have documented cases of electoral fraud in postal voting and we all face new challenges such as internet voting in future.
So let us be open to scrutiny, for such openness can only increase our own credibility.
<D>
in writing. - (PL) Madam President, quality is a key word throughout the entire food production chain, namely 'from field to table'.
It is extremely important to make EU consumers aware of the high requirements and standards implemented in the area of foodstuffs, which farmers and producers of agricultural and food products have to meet, and of the associated costs.
EU food is distinguished by its high quality and correspondingly high standards.
The same cannot always be said of imported goods.
I do not think that we should create further certification systems at Community level, or further symbols which will differentiate food products in the EU.
This will mislead the consumer.
Instead, we should concentrate on promotional measures to inform consumers about EU symbols which are already in use and which consumers should view as a guarantee of quality.
Another challenge is to improve the process of assessing applications concerning regional products and to speed up the registration process.
Unfortunately, the processing of these applications by the European Commission drags on for years.
The Lesser Poland and Kielce regions of Poland are still waiting for registration of products such as fasola korczyńska (the Korczyn bean), kiełbasa lisiecka (Lisiecka sausage), wiśnia nadwiślanka (the Vistula region cherry), śliwka szydłowska (the Szydlow plum), jabłka łąckie (the Łącko apple), obwarzanek krakowski (the Cracow bagel) and fasola z Doliny Dunajca (the Danube Valley bean).
<D>
I voted in favour of the mobilisation of the European Solidarity Fund.
I believe, in fact, that the fund is a valuable tool for enabling the European Union to show solidarity with the populations of regions affected by natural disasters, by providing financial support to help ensure a swift return to normal living conditions.
The application approved during today's vote was made by Ireland, and it concerns the heavy rain that caused severe flooding in November 2009.
The flooding caused severe damage to the agricultural sector, residential properties and businesses, the road network and other infrastructure.
The Irish authorities estimate the total direct damage caused by the disaster at EUR 520.9 million.
Although this is below the threshold provided for by the regulation, the Commission examined the application on the basis of the so-called 'extraordinary regional disaster' criterion.
Under this criterion, a region can benefit from assistance from the fund where that region has been affected by a natural disaster, mainly a natural one, affecting the majority of its population, with serious and lasting repercussions for living conditions and the economic stability of the region.
Lastly, I would add that the fund has been mobilised for a total amount of EUR 13 022 500.
<D>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is the world's largest donor of development aid, accounting for 60% of all funding.
The Union's central role as a key actor in development cooperation should be strengthened even further in the future.
In order to stabilise the economies of the developing countries and bring peace to them, it is vitally important that the Union keeps to its target to increase its share of development aid by 0.7% of GDP by the year 2015.
This alone, however, will not be enough.
It is essential to achieve general coherence in development cooperation among the different institutions.
Financial investment and projects intended to build infrastructure and for more satisfactory adherence to the notion of human rights need to be undertaken in such a way that they support one another.
The EU needs to establish the necessary instruments for implementing coherent development policy measures.
The Union's current legal basis for development cooperation, however, is flawed in terms of legislation, and that is why I would like to thank the rapporteur for raising what is an important issue.
Projects aimed at improving the transport, technology and energy sectors and the dialogue between the scientific community and NGOs are essential for the social viability of developing countries.
The main goal of such projects is not, however, to foster economic development and prosperity in the developing countries, and they do not therefore meet the criteria for official development aid as set by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.
In future, official development aid should focus specifically on the elimination of poverty and improving people's living conditions.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, in 2000, the millennium year, 17.6% of the population aged between 18 and 24 had not gone beyond lower secondary education.
By last year, 2006, the level had fallen to 15.3%.
Six new Member States had already beaten our 2010 benchmark, which is 10%.
Under Article 149, as I previously mentioned, this is the full responsibility of Member States.
The content and organisation of education is the competence of Member States.
Our role is to support and supplement the action of Member States.
We have done this in a number of ways.
I will mention just some.
In particular, the Commission has supported the development of the evidence base on which policy measures can be built, sponsoring a number of studies around this problem.
Further, last year, in our 2006 communication on efficiency and equity in European education and training systems, the Commission stressed the importance of pre-primary, pre-school, education as an effective means to reduce school drop-out rates, and pointed to the dangers of tracking pupils too early.
The Commission has also launched a public consultation process quite recently on the modernisation of school education.
This includes seeking the views of stakeholders on how best to tackle early school-leaving.
In the framework of the analysis of the Lisbon national reforms programme, the Commission issued specific recommendations to Member States about early school-leaving, where it was deemed necessary.
Through the education training 2010 work programme, it has used the open method of coordination to develop good practice and peer learning on early school-leaving.
Member States have also been encouraged to make use of the Structural Funds for targeted interventions to tackle particularly high rates of early school-leaving and to participate in projects funded under the lifelong learning programme, which addresses this issue.
In conclusion, progress has been visible and measurable, but not yet enough, and we need to really continue and improve the dynamics.
<D>
(LV) Thank you, Mr President.
I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to the European Commission for representing the interests of the new Member States in the talks with the United States on the introduction of a visa waiver programme.
The Commission has consistently kept this issue on its agenda.
Following the talks between the European Union and the United States in March we can conclude with satisfaction that there has been success in defusing possible conflict situations with individual Member States beginning bilateral talks with the United States on the introduction of visa waiver programmes.
As we know, the United States maintained the position that it would remove visa systems only in bilateral talks with each individual Member State.
Therefore, we should welcome the results of the March summit between the European Union and the United States, in which agreement was reached on the twin-track approach.
In the current situation this should be regarded as an ideal solution, which defuses potential conflicting policies.
The Member States that are currently in the process of talks with the United States concerning the introduction of visa waiver programmes have a great deal of interest in the agreement reached with the United States in the March summit concerning the successful implementation, by June this year, of the electronic travel authorisation system and the coordination of its introduction with the planned EU system.
For these Member States, any delay would mean dragging out the introduction of visa waiver programmes with the United States.
Thank you.
<D>
in writing. - (PT) Since 2005 the European Commission has brought forward a range of legislative initiatives aimed at regulating and facilitating the exchange of criminal records in order to do away with a slow and basically inefficient system that operated on the basis of mechanisms laid down in the 1959 Convention of the Council of Europe.
The first improvement was made with the 2005 Council Decision on the exchange of information extracted from the criminal record, particularly with regard to shortening transmission times.
In 2007 the Council reached political agreement on a framework decision which aims to ensure that each Member State can respond as fully and correctly as possible to requests for criminal records made to them on their nationals.
The present initiative does not aim to alter the basic principles of that framework decision, but rather to supplement them.
It aims to create a computerised system for the exchange of information on convictions between the Member States, in other words the European Criminal Records Information System (ECRIS).
There will still be 27 different legal systems, all with their own judicial and social sensitivities, but the aim has been to find a common focal point to allow the practical application of the system.
In this context, to ensure that there is adequate data protection, we can once again clearly see the urgent need to adopt the framework decision on data protection in the third pillar, for which I have repeatedly called.
<D>
(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, terrorism and serious organised crime are global phenomena.
The means for fighting these must therefore be proportional and effective.
I took due note of the answers given to the questions.
These answers were quite correct: it is true that guarantees must be demanded and that this is a delicate issue.
However, it is also true that it is absolutely inexcusable to provide a globalised and harmonised response.
Those people who are somewhat detached from terrorism are more concerned about individual guarantees.
My concern is for both individual and collective guarantees.
It is absolutely vital that we start where we can.
If we have to start with air transport, given that air carriers already have this data, then that is where we must start.
We will demand guarantees, we will assess the scope and we will start with international transport.
However, it should be noted that we will then move on to domestic transport because terrorists very often do not come from outside, but are home-grown.
Ask the United States and everyone else, because that is how it is and that is how we will have to address it in the future.
<D>
Madam President, I rise to offer an explanation of vote on the Angelilli report 'Towards an EU strategy on the rights of the child'.
I note in the explanatory statement that the rapporteur says she 'wishes to point out that the aim of this report is not to draw up a list of problems to be resolved or rights to be taken into account as a matter of priority'.
I represent a constituency, London, the greatest city in the world, capital of the greatest country in the world, and there are a number of children in my constituency.
In fact, I am the father of two children and, as the great philosopher once said, I believe that children are our future.
Therefore, it is important that we do take account of the rights of children.
But I really have to question whether this should be done at EU level.
Let us look, for example, at whether we want young adolescents to be given information and education on that dirty word 'sexual and reproductive rights'.
I think we should be very careful in looking for local solutions - and give the people of Britain a say on a referendum on the Constitution.
<D>
Madam President, Commissioners, can I say to you that less than a year ago we were debating in this Chamber what we were going to do about global food security, and was there enough food in the world, and we were terribly worried about it.
Here we are, less than a year later, debating this legislation tonight, which has the potential of actually reducing food production in the European Union; and there is a morality about producing food because what you must remember is that if we in Europe do not produce food we can probably pay for it, but the developing world cannot.
Much of this legislation will affect our crops - not only wheat, as Robert Sturdy has said, but potatoes in particular.
We have had two of the worst summers that I have ever seen in the last two years in northern Europe.
We have needed fungicides to reduce blight and actually grow the potatoes.
And if people in Europe do not eat potatoes, what do they eat, Commissioners?
They eat rice and they eat pasta both of which - and certainly rice - the developing world is very short of.
Further to what Robert Sturdy has said, many of these pesticides and fungicides we are using, if they are used properly and you have the proper withdrawal period, pose no problems, and by using these particular chemicals we can produce very good food.
And if you stand and tell me that you will stop imported food coming in that has been actually sprayed with these particular types of chemicals - you will not!
For the simple reason that, if they had been properly applied, you can actually test your wheat as much as you like as it comes through the port of Rotterdam, but you will find no residue there.
So I think we really do have to wake up to the fact that we in Europe need to produce food and we need to produce it safely, make sure that we reduce the amount of chemicals we use, which we are already doing, and we have got to make sure that we are training farmers to spray properly, which again we are also doing.
So, I would urge you: please, have a proper impact assessment, because it was two years ago you did your impact assessment.
We have had two of the wettest summers on record; it is time for you to look again.
We really do urge you to have a proper impact assessment.

We find it absolutely unacceptable that self-employed drivers are excluded from the scope of application of the directive on the organisation of the working time of persons performing mobile road transport activities.
This decision would mean serious risks for road safety, which would be compromised not only by the over-long driving times but also by the drivers having to perform too many activities other than driving.
This decision would also lead to unfair competition between transport companies.
It would effectively favour the use of independent workers who are able to offer lower-cost services due to their greater flexibility.
The exclusion of self-employed drivers could also have the counter-productive effect of causing a fragmentation in transport companies, with subsequent market distortions.
To evade the directive, organised companies could, in fact, break themselves down into a myriad of small enterprises.
We also reject the compromise approach whereby Member States are left to decide for themselves because this situation would also pave the way for inequality between entities belonging to different states that exercise the same working activities.
I therefore voted against the motion.
Apart from anything else, stirring up discrimination in the mobile road transport industry is completely at odds with the aim of setting up a common transport policy.
<D>
(SK) There may be debate later about what I want to say.
In 2002 former Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán appeared before the European Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs.
He stated that the decrees of President Beneš were incompatible with EU law.
The European Commission subsequently carried out an analysis of this matter.
The conclusion was that the European Commission considers the issue of the decrees of President Beneš to be resolved and closed.
As a result of constant efforts to open up these decrees, last week the National Council of the Slovak Republic adopted a resolution on the inviolability of post-war documents.
The resolution, which condemns the principle of collective guilt, was supported by members of the coalition and opposition parties.
History cannot be reversed or changed.
A situation that occurred in exceptional circumstances must be viewed in the context of the time in which it occurred.
Challenging and revising the post-war order of Europe is not what the majority of progressive and positive thinking Europeans expect of us.
Our common aim is peace, cooperation and resolution of the problems facing people who live in the here and now.
<D>
in writing. - (PL) Mr Weber has tabled a very interesting report on what is currently a controversial issue.
In the present digital environment, services, networks and business systems have undergone significant changes, and a wide choice is now available to consumers.
Interoperability has therefore become a fundamental concept for information and telecommunications networks.
I agree that users' needs should be of paramount importance in market development.
Accordingly, it is important to focus on viewers and on enabling them to make fully informed choices, so that they really are in a position to benefit from the full potential of new technology.
The interoperability debate mainly concerns broadening the choice offered to consumers in the area of interactive television services.
This choice largely involves the services offered by operators rather than the equipment, however, especially as the choice can take various forms, and subscribers are able to choose between different platforms depending on the content and services available.
I agree with the rapporteur that it is advisable to continue promoting the open standards developed by European Union standards bodies in relation to the switchover to digital and the interoperability of services, and to further this action by promoting European digital television standards in other parts of the world.
<D>
in writing. - (FI) I wish to thank the rapporteur for producing a report that deals so comprehensively with the multi-faceted nature of cultural industries and the main problem areas associated with them.
When pondering the status of cultural industries in European society, there are two basic principles that need to be remembered.
Firstly, we need to understand how important culture is for people's quality of life.
Cultural products enhance wellbeing.
The Community recognises that Europeans have basic rights to education, which include people's right to culture.
We are therefore talking about fundamental civil rights.
Secondly, we need to understand how important culture is for those who produce it.
For many the work is not just a passion - it is a livelihood.
Receiving appropriate payment for one's work is a basic right.
It is up to the legislators to ensure that such people can work in an environment which is not detrimental to their rights.
There is no cultural output without its creators, and if they are not paid for the work they do, the result is a limit to cultural growth.
Legislation on cultural industries, such as the protection of intellectual property rights and neighbouring rights, therefore always has to strike the right balance between culture's two social dimensions.
It requires special sensitivity on the part of the legislator.
It has to be recognised that cultural industries are a very special sector and therefore require a very special legal status.
The main challenge for cultural industries is obviously information technology.
They clearly benefit from developments in technology and the information market, but at the same time they need protection when new systems are being used.
We also need the Commission to deliver prompt measures to clarify the relationship between intellectual property and culture and the economy.
The main challenge is how we can guarantee fair and genuine remuneration for every right holder and each individual cultural industry for the work done, at the same time ensuring that consumers have choice and easy access to cultural products.
<D>
in writing. - (FR) I voted against the report on cross-border health services as it meets neither the EU objective on a high level of health, in accordance with Article 152 of the Treaty, nor the demand of European citizens to be able to enjoy safe, quality healthcare, close to home.
The report does not make prior authorisation the rule for being able to receive treatment in another Member State of the EU.
Prior authorisation allows the financial equilibrium of the social systems to be managed, whilst giving patients guaranteed conditions for reimbursement and the information they require before receiving any hospital treatment abroad.
It is not acceptable, either, that improvement in the quality of health care should be achieved by making treatment providers compete, or to argue the principle of the free movement of patients: the latter depends above all on their state of health.
The amendments adopted are too vague, opening the way to problems being settled by the European Court of Justice.
This directive only reinforces health inequalities between Europe's citizens, as only those who can pay health costs in advance will be able to choose quality services.
<D>
(NL) Mr President, by introducing emissions trading into aviation, Europe shows ambition, the ambition to tackle CO2 emissions and combat climate change.
After all, nowhere in the world to date - not even in California - has such an ambitious approach been proposed.
Even compared to the emissions trading scheme for industry, this is a very ambitious plan.
However, what did our Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety do?
It tightened up this proposal considerably on the key points, and thus we have flown past our objective.
Europe must show leadership, but leadership means not only taking the lead, but also persuading others, winning them over - and this in the extremely competitive environment of international aviation.
Therefore, the new regime should on no account lead to high costs and bureaucracy, particularly for Europe's airlines, but there must be a gain for the climate.
A net climate benefit must emerge, preferably worldwide.
I am pleased, therefore, that amendments have now been tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and also by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, which I expect to steer us onto a realistic course tomorrow.
This is necessary in order to promote cleaner flying in practice, too, as having to go through the bureaucratic mill of an auction - even with clean aircraft - is hardly salutary.
As regards the number of available allowances, too, I look forward to a more realistic outcome tomorrow.
However, this proposal alone will certainly not suffice.
The Commission and the European Parliament must stand shoulder to shoulder to bring about the Single European Sky, as five times more environmental gain is to be achieved from that.
Mr President, I hope that we can step up the pressure on Member States in this regard, too, as only then can we make a real difference to the climate.
<D>
in writing. - (PT) I could only vote in favour of this report.
To say yes to all the forces for liberalisation of the electricity market is to say yes to a fairer, more competitive and more transparent market.
However, it is not only the correctness of this report, which places the consumer at the heart of the issue, that attracts me.
With increasing energy prices and a lack of competition in national markets, there is a danger of increasing the number of citizens excluded from accessing energy.
I therefore agree with the social concerns expressed as, for the first time, the concept of 'fuel poverty' has been defined, drawing attention to the importance of the Member States developing national plans which cover all citizens.
Given the current situation in the national energy markets within the EU, it is unacceptable for one company to both own the electricity network and also be responsible for the transmission of electricity, thus holding a de facto monopoly, as it can then block access to the market for new operators who, in many cases, are more competitive.
This document therefore courageously identifies the need to increase the level of transparency and competition within the energy sector, while effectively protecting the consumer from the consequences of a closed and inflexible market.
<D>
Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Veraldi very much for his report on young farmers.
I think that we live in a world now where food production is becoming very important again and we have to look to the future.
One of the ways of looking to the future of agriculture is through young farmers.
With the reform of the common agricultural policy, we now have the health check to look particularly at things which will help young farmers, and that is reduction in bureaucracy and abolishing quotas so that young farmers can go into milk production, which is one of the ways that they have always got into farming.
We also have to look a little bit further towards some sort of venture capital schemes, because one of the problems facing young farmers is they have very little collateral when they want to start farming.
Very often banks will not give them the necessary cash to start, so I think we have to look forward to that as well.
I believe that young farmers can link into food production, they can link into niche markets, and they can produce the type of food in the regions that we want and really link into the market place.
I welcome the report and I look forward to supporting young farmers.
<D>
Mr President, we are all aware that the background and the origins of the European Solidarity Fund lie in the devastating floods in Central Eastern Europe in 2002; its necessity was further cemented by other natural disasters such as the forest fires in Greece.
And recently the flooding in my own constituency in Northern Ireland brought it home to me how important this is.
Despite widespread support and enthusiasm for the Fund expressed by Parliament and the Commission and among EU citizens, the Council's reluctance to cooperate is hindering its full implementation.
Surely the European Union wishes to grant assistance to Member States which have experienced natural disaster.
This aid must be administered in a swift and responsive manner in order to have any chance of being effective.
However, the Council is currently placing obstacles in the way which are preventing the smooth operation of the Fund.
I am glad therefore that the tabling of this oral question and its urgency is a matter which is highlighted by the Committee.
Furthermore I would like to stress the part of the question posed by the Committee, which asked which Member States are opposed to the Fund, and please tell us why.
The Solidarity Fund is an extremely important mechanism for the European Union to have at its disposal.
However, problems of its implementation have dragged on for far too long and in my opinion this needs to be resolved as soon as possible.
It matters nothing whether it is floods or forest fires, when people are in trouble they need help and assistance and above all they require financial support, upfront and speedily; not like the present system that has taken months and years and has been stifled totally by bureaucracy.
If you really want to do something positive, this is it and will bring you more credit to Europe than any of your other proposals or all of them put together.
I want to make it very clear to the Council.
The Council disagreed because, in my opinion - and it is only my opinion - they do not want Parliament, and more importantly, they do not want the Members of this Parliament in the local region, where we are more important than you, the Commission or they, the Council.
Because when something happens the people look to the Members.
They do not look to the Commission and they do not look to the Council and they do not know who you are.
You are an untouchable, faceless, bureaucratic body in Brussels.
So it is the Members - so do not run away from it - we, the Parliament, are the people who are out there with the people all the time and we need that support.
I have never heard such feeble excuses in all my life; it is time to get this done.
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (CS) Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Onyszkiewicz for producing this important, well-written and balanced report.
As the shadow rapporteur of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I am delighted that the report also reflects our main priorities on Russia, such as pragmatic cooperation based on a healthy market environment, an emphasis on human rights, a functioning legal state and democracy, all of which are fundamental social values for the EU, as well as an emphasis on respect for the sovereignty of all neighbouring states and for the unity of the EU.
The new agreement under negotiation must include all aspects of cooperation, be legally binding, and reflect the quality of our relations with Russia.
However, if the discussions are to reflect our positions and our values we must not forget the role played by Russia in the war in Georgia last year or in the January gas crisis.
We cannot permit the creation of new spheres of influence in Europe.
We cannot accept the status quo, or rather the fait accompli in the Caucasus.
Hence the requirement for unambiguous guarantees that Russia will not use force against any of its neighbours and that it will deal with disputes in our shared neighbourhood together with the EU.
In our view it is entirely natural to invite Russia to take the first direct confidence building step.
Many fellow members today rightly emphasise the need for EU unity in relation to Russia.
However, we can only achieve a genuinely unified position gradually, hence my proposal to set up a consultation mechanism within a Council framework enabling the Member States to consult each other, well in advance of all bilateral issues involving Russia that have an impact on another Member State or on the EU as a whole.
Only in this way will we arrive at a genuinely unified position towards Russia and only like this will we fully exploit our greatest advantage in relation to Russia, which is our own unity.
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, the extension of the Schengen area has removed border controls in most of the EU and made day-to-day travel within those borders quicker and easier for our citizens.
It also means, however, that non-EU citizens entering the Schengen area are effectively only checked once, at the external border.
While our citizens often equate illegal immigration with dramatic scenes of unseaworthy and overcrowded vessels breaching our maritime borders, or container-loads of unfortunates - victims of human trafficking - crossing land borders, the reality is much more complex.
About 50% of illegal immigrants enter the EU legally, but fail to leave our territory on expiry of their visas.
Secondly, incidents of falsified documents are widespread, especially at airports.
In order to reduce the number of overstayers, as well as to decrease the risk of granting access to persons with falsified documents, a harmonised and secure system for checking visa validity and taking fingerprints will apply in the Schengen area.
However, as all our citizens who travel are well aware, increased security leads to increased inconvenience and waiting times at borders for bona fide travellers.
Therefore a degree of pragmatism is also necessary.
If there is deemed to be no risk related to internal security and illegal immigration, and traffic at a border is of such intensity that waiting times become excessive, then the need to take fingerprints may be waived.
This more flexible system may operate for a maximum of three years, after which an evaluation of its effectiveness will take place.
While we aim to make Europe secure, we need at the same time to be welcoming to business travellers and tourists alike.
I believe that the proposed visa information system has struck the right balance between those two objectives.
<D>
in writing. - (PL) Over 2 billion tonnes of goods pass through the Union's air and sea ports every year.
The customs services deal with in excess of 100 million customs declarations.
By so doing, they are protecting the health and safety of European Union citizens.
The customs services are also involved in practices connected with counterfeiting goods.
This is a growing and increasingly dangerous phenomenon concerning not only fashionable luxury goods but also medicines, toothpaste and skincare products.
The customs services are seizing counterfeit spare parts for motor vehicles, such as braking systems.
Counterfeit sunglasses can cause damage to the wearer's eyesight.
Combating these practices and putting a stop to them will contribute to better health protection and improved security for the citizens.
The customs authorities introduced appropriate security checks to protect the internal market.
Working in close cooperation with important trading partners at international level, they protect international freight transport against the smuggling of goods linked to terrorist activity.
<D>
Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth. - Mr President, Members of the European Parliament, I thank you for the privilege of addressing you today, and I thank you even more for undertaking this vital initiative of intercultural dialogue.
I salute you all, but in particular your visionary, wise and deeply humane President, Hans-Gert Pöttering.
May I - in what I hope will be today my only breach of the separation between church and state, religion and politics - give my prayer and my blessing that God will bless all of you and all you do.
Thank you.
I speak as a Jew from within the oldest continuous cultural presence in Europe.
I want to begin by reminding us that European civilisation was born 2 000 years ago in a dialogue, a dialogue between the two greatest cultures of antiquity: Ancient Greece and Biblical Israel - Athens and Jerusalem.
They were brought together by Christianity, whose religion came from Israel but whose sacred texts were written in Greek, and that was the founding dialogue of Europe.
And some of the greatest moments in European history in the intervening 2 000 years were the result of dialogue.
I will mention just three.
The first took place between the 10th and 13th centuries in al-Andalus, in the great cultural movement initiated by the Umayyads in Spain.
It began with an Islamic dialogue on the part of thinkers like Averroës with the philosophical heritage of Plato and Aristotle.
The Islamic dialogue inspired Jewish thinkers like Moses Maimonides, and the Jewish dialogue inspired Christian thinkers, most famously Aquinas.
The second great moment of intercultural dialogue took place at the beginning of the Italian Renaissance when a young Christian intellectual, Pico della Mirandola, travelled to Padua, where he met a Jewish scholar, Rabbi Elijah Delmedigo, who taught him the Hebrew Bible, the Talmud and Kabbalah in their original languages.
Out of that dialogue came the most famous statement of Renaissance values: Pico's Oration on Human Dignity.
The third and most poignant of them all has been the dialogue between Christians and Jews after the Holocaust, inspired by Martin Buber's philosophy of dialogue and by Vatican II and Nostra Aetate.
The result has been that, after almost 2 000 years of estrangement and tragedy, today Jews and Christians meet in mutual respect as friends.
But I want to say more than this.
As I read the Hebrew Bible, I hear from the very beginning God's call to dialogue.
I want to draw attention to two passages.
I am not quite sure how this will go down in translation, so I hope anyone who is listening to me in translation will get it.
I want to draw attention to two passages in the opening chapters of the Bible whose meaning has been lost in translation for 2 000 years.
The first occurs when God sees the first man isolated and alone and He creates woman.
And man, seeing woman for the first time, utters the first poem in the Bible: 'Now I have found bone of my bone, flesh of my flesh.
She shall be called Aisha, woman, for she was taken from Aish, man'.
Now this sounds like a very simple poem.
It even sounds rather condescending, as if the man was the first creation and women were a mere afterthought.
However, the real meaning lies in the fact that biblical Hebrew has two words for man, not one.
One is Adam, and the other is Aish.
This verse that I just quoted to you is the first time the word 'Aish' appears in the Bible.
Listen again.
'She shall be called Aisha, because she was taken from Aish'.
In other words, the man has to pronounce the name of his wife before he even knows his own name.
I have to say 'you' before I can say 'I'.
I have to acknowledge the other, before I can truly understand myself.
(Loud applause)
That is the first point the Bible makes: identity is dialogical.
The second occurs soon after, in the first great tragedy that overcomes the first human children Cain and Abel.
We expect brotherly love.
Instead there is sibling rivalry and then murder, fratricide.
And at the heart of this story in Genesis, Chapter IV, is a verse that is impossible to translate and in every English Bible I have ever read the verse is not translated, it is paraphrased.
I am going to translate it literally and you will see why no one translates it that way.
Literally the Hebrew means as follows: 'And Cain said to Abel, and it came to pass when they were out in the field that Cain rose up against Abel and killed him.'
You can see immediately why it cannot be translated because it says 'and Cain said' but it does not say what he said.
The sentence is ungrammatical.
The syntax is fractured.
And the question is, why?
The answer is clear: the Bible is signalling in the most dramatic way, in a broken sentence, how the conversation broke down.
The dialogue failed.
And what do we read immediately afterwards?
'And Cain rose up against his brother and killed him'.
Or to put it simply: where words end, violence begins.
Dialogue is the only way to defeat the worst angels of our nature.
(Loud applause)
Dialogue therefore testifies to the double aspect of all human relationships, whether they are between individuals or between countries or cultures or creeds.
Our commonalities, on the one hand, and our differences on the other.
What we hold in common and what is uniquely ours.
Let me put it as simply as I can.
If we were completely different, we could not communicate, but if we were totally the same, we would have nothing to say.
(Applause)
And that is all I have to say about dialogue, and yet I want to add that dialogue may not be quite enough.
You see, between the late 18th century and 1933, there was dialogue between Jews and Germans, just as there was dialogue and even friendship between Hutus and Tutsis in Rwanda, or between Serbs and Croats and Muslims in Bosnia and Kosovo.
Dialogue brings us together, but it cannot always keep us together when other forces are driving us apart.
Therefore, I want to add one other word, which played a significant part in healing fragmented societies.
The word is 'covenant'.
It played a major role in European politics in the 16th and 17th centuries in Switzerland, in Holland, in Scotland and in England.
Covenant has been part of American culture from the very beginning to today, from the Mayflower Compact in 1620, to John Winthrop's speech aboard the Arabella in 1631, all the way through to the present.
I do not know what Barack Obama will say when he makes his inaugural speech but he will either mention or allude to the concept of covenant.
Covenant is, of course, a key word of the Hebrew Bible for a simple reason: biblical Israel was formed out of 12 different tribes, each of which had insisted on retaining its distinct identity.
What is a covenant?
A covenant is not a contract.
A contract is made for a limited period, for a specific purpose, between two or more parties, each seeking their own benefit.
A covenant is made open-endedly by two or more parties who come together in a bond of loyalty and trust to achieve together what none can achieve alone.
A contract is like a deal; a covenant is like a marriage.
Contracts belong to the market and to the state, to economics and politics, both of which are arenas of competition.
Covenants belong to families, communities, charities, which are arenas of cooperation.
A contract is between me and you - separate selves - but a covenant is about us - collective belonging.
A contract is about interests; a covenant is about identity.
And hence the vital distinction, not made clearly enough in European politics, between a social contract and a social covenant: a social contract creates a state; a social covenant creates a society.
(Applause)
You can have a society without a state - that has happened at times in history - but can you have a state without a society, without anything to hold people together?
I do not know.
You can hold people together in many different ways: by force, by fear, by suppressing cultural difference, by expecting everyone to conform.
But when you choose to respect the integrity of many cultures, when you honour what I call - as the President reminded us - the dignity of difference, when you honour that, then to create a society you need a covenant.
Covenant restores the language of cooperation to a world of competition.
It focuses on responsibilities, not just on rights.
Rights are essential, but rights create conflicts that rights cannot resolve: the right to life against the right to choose; my right to freedom against your right to respect.
Rights without responsibilities are the subprime mortgages of the moral world.
(Loud applause)
What covenant does is to get us to think about reciprocity.
Covenant says to each of us: we must respect others if we expect others to respect us; we must honour the freedom of others if they are to honour ours.
Europe needs a new covenant and the time to begin it is now.
(Applause)
Now, in the midst of financial crisis and economic recession, because in bad times people are aware that we all share a fate.
The Prophet Isaiah foresaw a day when the lion and the lamb would live together.
It has not happened yet.
Although there was a zoo where a lion and a lamb lived together in the same cage and a visitor asked the zookeeper: 'How do you manage that?'.
The zookeeper said: 'Easy, you just need a new lamb every day!'.
(Laughter)
But there was a time when the lion and the lamb did live together.
Where was that?
In Noah's Ark.
And why was that?
It was not because they had reached Utopia but because they knew that otherwise they would both drown.
Friends, last Thursday - six days ago - the Archbishop of Canterbury and I led a mission of the leaders of all the faiths in Britain, leaders of the Muslim community, the Hindus, the Sikhs, the Buddhists, the Jains, the Zoroastrians and the Baha'i, and together we travelled and spent a day in Auschwitz.
There we wept together, and there we prayed together, knowing what happens when we fail to honour the humanity of those not like us.
God has given us many languages and many cultures, but only one world in which to live together, and it is getting smaller every day.
May we, the countries and the cultures of Europe, in all our glorious diversity, together write a new European covenant of hope.
(The House accorded the speaker a standing ovation.)
<D>
Member of the Commission. - I agree with the approach that neighbourhood policy is about reform for reforms.
The more our partners are committed to reforms, the more active the Commission is in supporting that country and ensuring that reforms are adopted and implemented.
If you look at the countries participating in the Eastern Partnership, you can see that this policy is actually working.
We have the same set of instruments - the Association Agreement, the Economic Integration Agreement and a method for dealing with mobility and visa-related issues.
If you look at the participants in the Eastern Partnership, you can see a big difference in their attitude to reforms and in the Commission's attitude to those countries.
I could cite Moldova as a good example - the country with which we have actually started negotiations on an accession agreement, with which we have started the dialogue on visas, and with which, I hope, we will very soon also start negotiations on the Economic Integration Agreement, otherwise known as deep and comprehensive free trade agreements.
Subject: Infringement of fair trade rules by European importers
In recent months, several cases, many of which have come to court, have demonstrated that European importers and distributors are not complying with the most fundamental rules of fair trade (hours of work, child labour, overtime, etc.), while professing the contrary by means of misleading advertising and 'ethical' labels.
Can the Commission provide details of how it is including these obligations of compliance with the ILO's minimum social standards in the trade agreements which it is negotiating for the European Union, how it is monitoring compliance with these obligations and what penalties is it imposing where an infringement is substantiated, such as the case of Lidl, a company recently found guilty by a German court?
Subject: Fair Trade
The EP, the Council and the Commission have all recognised that Fair Trade initiatives contribute to sustainable development and introduce more fairness in trade, which is one of the new EU treaty objectives.
European citizens have also shown their support, with fair trade products reporting a massive increase in sales, particularly in my own Member State, the UK, where sales have increased by 12%.
On top of this, hundreds of local authorities are becoming Fair Trade towns.
Commissioner Mandelson took up the coordination of Fair Trade issues in DG TRADE in 2006.
Does the Commission plan to keep this responsibility?
How does the Commission plan to ensure that there is a consistent policy across the EC to ensure that Fair Trade initiatives can play their role in contributing to more fairness in international trade?
<D>
(PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I must once again beg forgiveness for my lateness.
This year we are celebrating the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue.
The need for everyone to be involved and the perception that education, knowledge and the interaction of different cultures are crucial are already well-established facts.
For this very reason, many initiatives associated with this Year have been carried out in various areas of action and intervention.
The Erasmus Mundus programme also has a role to play in this context and, within this new perspective, is already included in the new regulation.
The Erasmus Mundus programme makes an important contribution to the creation of centres of excellence in the EU which will, to a certain extent, limit the brain drain from the European Union.
It also plays a vital role in promoting European values among third-country nationals who come here to study and who find, on the old continent, an unparalleled cultural and linguistic diversity which represents a real attraction and which sets us apart from models existing in the rest of the world.
However, dialogue and intercultural understanding have faced some problems.
The issue of visas for Erasmus Mundus students and the frequent difficulties encountered in obtaining and renewing these visas often lead to students living in situations of semi-clandestinity in the European Union, as they attend the same courses but on tourist visas which have sometimes expired.
In my opinion, it is absolutely vital and urgent to find a solution allowing speed, transparency and efficiency in the issue of visas for these students.
Language knowledge is also vital as this allows cultural understanding and mutual coexistence beyond the strictly academic sphere.
As a result, we must absolutely guarantee this premise.
Finally, I must thank Mrs De Sarnez for the way in which she has conducted this whole process and for the balanced report that she has produced.
<D>
Mr President, the leader of the ALDE Group, Mr Watson, says that a job is the best social welfare.
Unfortunately there are too many millions of people in Europe working for less than what they might get if they were drawing social welfare.
The poor and the low-paid die younger, suffer more physical and mental illness, are hospitalised more, are imprisoned more, are excluded from participating fully in society, are denied full cultural, civil, social, and indeed secure lives, and their children are largely condemned to the same vicious cycle of deprivation - unless, that is, we as politicians pursue social and economic policies which are integrated and interdependent.
People must be treated as citizens, not as economic units.
Does this agenda achieve this?
Regretfully, no.
This is not to deny the positive elements - for instance the horizontal directive on discrimination.
Nor indeed do I deny that Commissioner Špidla has struggled hard in a hostile environment to get this package approved.
We will work with him to make it better.
The Commission and the Council have nine months to prove their bona fides on social Europe.
The people will then give their verdict.
<D>
Madam President, well, we do seem to have a lot of armchair generals in the House this afternoon!
The desperate humanitarian and security situation in Darfur and neighbouring regions of Chad and the Central African Republic certainly cry out for international action, but I have to say that is a separate matter from the issue before us today, which is really about ESDP, as we have heard from so many speakers.
I have long argued against the waste of resources, the duplication, the divisions, indeed the sheer duplicity involved in the EU's attempts to develop a military capability.
There are no EU troops, Mr Ryan.
Our nations have troops and there are already well-tried structures for organising international military intervention by that small number of states that have capable armed forces and an expeditionary capability.
This is primarily through NATO and the UN.
The EU institutions have little to contribute to military matters.
It is clear that the motives of the ESDP enthusiasts are essentially political.
Indeed, one has said that Chad should be seen as a political opportunity.
The EU offered itself to the UN; it was not the UN that invited the EU.
The EU is desperately keen to pin its institutional label on another military operation but, not surprisingly, national military staffs do not share the enthusiasm of the Eurocrats.
With extended lines of communication, over a thousand miles to the nearest seaport, lack of water resources and infrastructure, and a reluctance to take on rebel groups with offensive military operations, the Chad mission is precarious from every point of view.
Britain, Germany and Italy have already said that they will not be sending any troops.
What is this force going to do?
Certainly not take on the armed hostile elements that have created the mayhem in this vast area of Africa.
Undoubtedly, therefore, most of its effort will go into protecting and sustaining itself in a very difficult logistical situation.
We really must stop playing around and using human tragedy as a political opportunity.
<D>
(FR) Madam President, I would like to welcome the discussion and the adoption of this European private company statute and I would like in particular to praise our rapporteur, Mr Lehne.
I think that the text that will be adopted by this House will, in a way, carry his name and the European private company will be known to posterity as the Klaus-Heiner Lehne company.
I would just like to comment on one point.
I share the view that Mr Becsey has just expressed.
I believe that the provisions for worker participation proposed in the compromise run counter to the agreed objective, in other words run counter to the ease and effectiveness of this statute for small and medium-sized enterprises.
I think it is a mistake to introduce worker participation at such a level, in other words in such small companies.
I understand perfectly well the attachment to a system of social and economic management which has proven its worth.
I think that, in this case, we are losing some of the effectiveness of the statute we are proposing and that is going to be adopted, by imposing worker participation systems on small companies when such systems, I feel, are only suitable for large companies.
However, aside from this reservation, I think that this text is excellent.
<D>
(PL) Madam President, Commissioner, I should like to begin by thanking Mr Cappato for his work on this report.
The report posed a great challenge as it attempts to respond to one of the most difficult problems in the contemporary world.
Opium production in Afghanistan is increasing year on year.
According to the latest annual report, opium production is now double what it was two years ago.
In practice, Afghanistan currently has a monopoly of the supply of the deadliest drug in the world.
It accounts for 93% of world production of opiates.
Our President is numbered amongst those who believe that Afghanistan's fate is our common cause.
The heroic struggle of the Afghan people during the Cold War period contributed to the spread of freedom across the contemporary world and to the fall of the Iron Curtain in Europe.
The European Union is now honour bound to provide Afghanistan with military, administrative and economic assistance.
This also involves assistance in combating the production of drugs in Afghanistan.
It should be remembered that the main incentive for Afghan growers to produce opiates is financial profit.
This should be borne in mind when devising the European aid programme aimed at resolving the problem.
That is why I particularly wished to commend Mr Cappato on the courageous proposals he makes in this report.
They may well help to resolve the situation in question.
One of these proposals involves offering aid through the introduction of a pilot scientific project for the production of poppies for medical purposes which will allow for further research into the extent to which awarding licences can contribute to poverty reduction, diversification of the rural economy, general development and improved security.
In a nutshell, this is not about moralising but about the European Union making an effective contribution to resolving this problem in Afghanistan.
<D>
in writing. - (SK) I voted for the report by Mr Horst Schnellhardt because it will result in the reduction of bureaucratic burdens for small and medium-sized enterprises in the food industry, in particular for micro-enterprises (bakeries etc.), it will make business activities more attractive and it will create new jobs.
The report introduces several changes concerning small and medium-sized enterprises producing and selling food, operating on regional and local markets.
These are not veterinary regulations.
When considering the food hygiene package, Parliament wanted above all to ensure the highest possible level of food safety and at the same time to establish a practicable and flexible control mechanism.
Those small and medium-sized enterprises that can prove that there are no hazards in the area of food hygiene and that the hygiene of foodstuffs is regularly controlled are exempt from HACCP procedures.
The HACCP system provides a hazard analysis and a critical control point method.
It was developed in the US in the 1960s by NASA, when the Agency needed to ensure 100% safety of all foodstuffs and nutritional products.
In 1992 the system was incorporated into European legislation.
The Food Code of the Slovak Republic refers to HACCP as 'Proper Production Practice'.
Preparing documentation is complicated and owners of micro-enterprises are discouraged from doing business by unjustifiable bureaucracy.
Since the hygiene regulations in Slovakia are far stricter than those in the 15 old Member States, it is necessary to harmonise the hygiene rules across the entire EU.
<D>
(RO) I am glad to be given the floor concerning a reality that is much ignored, namely the position of women in rural areas.
Although the system of legislation and norms valid at Union level, as well as at the level of each and every Member State, precludes any kind of discrimination, it is obvious that there is a significant discrepancy between the life of women in urban areas and women in rural areas.
Romania, like other new Member States of the European Union, is in a much worse situation than the general one described in the report.
Given the background of deindustrialisation in the 1990s, there was a phenomenon that the West European countries have not encountered: migration from town to village as a solution for economic survival.
In our region, poverty in rural areas has affected and still affects women above all, and they have become the most vulnerable victims of trafficking in human beings.
Unfortunately, industrial agriculture, which could have attracted part of the female work force in the villages, itself underwent destructuring.
Public health, education, transport, water and sewerage services underwent an accelerated worsening, such services being practically absent in many villages in the less developed countries of the European Union.
Women in rural areas, especially young or middle-aged ones, could develop independent economic activities if they had access to bank loans and I believe we should discuss the opportunity of establishing a bank that would grant micro-loans in rural areas.
<D>
- Mr President, like the two previous speakers, I fear that the Commission and the Council have both painted rather a rose-tinted view of what is now the situation in Turkmenistan.
The current President may be marginally better than the President he replaced in February 2007, but is he sufficiently better for us to agree to an interim trade agreement as a precursor for a partnership and cooperation agreement?
As Mr Markov and Ms Flautre said, in the Committee on International Trade we set five very clear tasks for Turkmenistan that we would want to see met before we gave our agreement.
Firstly, we said that the International Red Cross had to have free access to Turkmenistan.
Unless the Commission and the Council can tell me differently, I understand that up until now the Red Cross has not been able to visit one single prison or prisoner in Turkmenistan.
Secondly, we said that they had to realign their education system with international standards.
The Council is right to say that it has expanded the secondary education system by one year, but my understanding again is that, despite minor improvements in the education system, this has not been aimed at the mass of Turkmens but at the elite and preparing those who wish to work in the oil and gas sector.
Thirdly we have asked for the release of all political prisoners.
Some have been released, but not many, and there are literally hundreds, if not thousands, of political prisoners languishing in jails in Turkmenistan, still awaiting a fair trial.
Fourthly, we said that we wanted the abolition of all restrictions to external travel.
It is interesting that both the Council and Commission concentrated on internal travel.
We said there had to be external travel freedom as well.
That has not been delivered.
Finally, we said there had to be free access for independent NGOs, free access for the UN human rights bodies and freedom of the press.
Well, there is no press freedom, there is no free access for NGOs, and, while the UN inspector on religious tolerance may have been allowed in, Turkmenistan has the longest queue of UN-requested visits of any country in the world.
Is this really a country that we can do business with?
Well, I suspect for the majority in this House and in other institutions the answer is clearly 'yes'.
Why have things changed since the Trade Committee passed its resolution in 2007?
Cynics might say that it is because gas and oil have been discovered in Turkmenistan, because we want to build a new pipeline, because we suddenly find it in our strategic interest.
If that is the case, let us not pretend it is to do with an improvement in human rights.
It is to do with self-interest at European Union level.
(The President cut off the speaker)
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the Council has managed to sum up its conclusions of the most important issue on its agenda in just over half a page.
The entire document runs to 25 pages.
This is - and I should like to emphasise this - a commendable show of restraint.
The style of the deliberations is also in keeping with the circumstances.
The Council is taking its time; it wishes to address the issue of the Lisbon Treaty again in October and, until then, it is doing what it can to clarify the matter.
This is all right and proper.
It is right and proper to respect the Irish vote.
It is wrong to start cracking the whip now and to expect that the Irish will then cosy up to us - that is utter nonsense.
Nevertheless, we must now give some thought to how we can overcome this situation, for the crisis that we are currently facing goes beyond what is now the second failed attempt at a treaty reform that is still necessary.
This crisis affects the EU's fundamental relationship with its citizens and the citizens' relationship with their Union.
Naturally, the Irish said 'no' for all kinds of different reasons.
A referendum is a political hotchpotch consisting of many different ingredients; in this case, several reasons have certainly had a part to play.
They lie partly in Irish domestic politics and partly in the Irish people's general disillusionment with politics - that is true; however, ladies and gentlemen, a system error is starting to filter through here.
A constitution needs a referendum and popular consent, but here we are dealing with an international treaty.
An international treaty is generally unsuitable for a referendum.
This system error is at our cost.
We shall have to consider whether we wish to continue in this way in future.
However, if you leave aside all aspects that derive from domestic political considerations, the Irish 'no' was basically directed at the European Union and perhaps least of all at the text of the Treaty.
President Barroso, your Commissioner, Mr McCreevy, is probably not the only one who has not read the Treaty, for it is essentially quite clear that the European Union is seeing its citizens increasingly turn against it.
It is up to us here to start searching for the reasons for this - we cannot leave that to the Irish.
It is up to us, to Parliament, to the Council and, not least, Mr President, to the Commission to start searching for those reasons.
The Commission's role is to serve as the source of EU policy initiatives.
Most notably, the Commission shapes the political climate.
When people talk about Brussels, then most think of the Commission, and only subsequently - rightly or regrettably - of Parliament or of the Council.
European unification is, essentially, undisputed.
I know of hardly any citizen who says that he is against European countries working together.
It is all the more astonishing that there has been such a large-scale rejection, which, in essence, is also encountered in all other countries to a greater or lesser degree.
It is rather the European Union's everyday image, primarily shaped by the Commission, that is presenting us with problems.
I think it can be said, President of the Commission, that Brussels increasingly gets on people's nerves.
The idea of the EU as a peacemaker and as a successful economic superpower is receding rapidly, and it appears to be a moloch whose vast and unwieldy bureaucracy, at times operating arbitrarily, makes people feel as if they have no say in their own affairs.
President of the Commission, you stated that you cannot bash Europe all week long and then expect a joyful 'yes' to Europe on Sunday.
It would have been more correct to say that you cannot continually lay down the law, regulate and tie everything up with red tape all week long and then expect a friendly 'yes' from the people on Sunday.
Let me give you an example: the Soil Protection Directive has been rejected by the requisite number of Member States on the grounds that it breaches the principle of subsidiarity.
The Commission is not concerned why this came about; instead, it is now making an attempt to ignore the 'no' vote and attain its stated objective.
It would be more appropriate that we in the European Union set ourselves limits - over and above the Treaty and its detailed provisions - and make decisions in Europe which manifestly need to be taken at European level.
This is why we need to develop a new culture of subsidiarity.
We must allow the Member States to exercise their powers and responsibilities, and we must also ensure that they do assume that responsibility.
The President of the Council spoke about the European identity.
It is, indeed, important.
However, it must be based on what is Europe's responsibility and what must remain the Member States' responsibility.
This is why we must do what we can to save the Treaty.
It is so very much better than anything that Nice has to offer us.
We must make the most of this opportunity - if such an opportunity exists - and we must try to reconnect the citizens with Europe.
(Applause)
<D>
(HU) Thank you, Madam President.
First of all, congratulations on the tenth birthday of the Economic and Monetary Union.
The euro has been a success: a stable currency with a low interest rate has come into being, an effective move to combat speculation, and we have been able to create many more jobs than before since the introduction of the euro.
We know this.
This is why the euro is attractive to countries that have joined the European Union but are not yet members of the euro zone.
Discipline is vitally important and central bank independence is vitally important, I agree.
However, the euro zone should not be an elite club, an elite political club, and we should not be saying that membership is open only to countries that have already implemented some degree of convergence in real terms.
The euro is in fact an instrument that could be of particular benefit to those countries that most are desperately in need of stability, of cohesion, and of measures to fight speculation and combat unemployment in order to become genuinely European.
For this reason, let us be wary of orthodox principles, even with regard to the inflation criterion.
It is also absolutely vital that the criteria should be established according to uniform standards.
Thank you very much, Madam President.
<D>
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, we want wine to be a unique beverage, both in its production and in its consumption.
What I mean is that we do not want any oenological methods that take us in the direction of Coca-Cola; we want the future of designations of origin and geographical indications to be secured.
We want to see support for organic production methods, and it is our wish - we have tabled an amendment to this effect - that regions should be able to decide by a majority vote that their wines can be traded in bottles only.
We agree with you that permanent distillation of wine is inappropriate, and its introduction through the back door of crisis distillation must be prevented.
We share your view on that point.
On the question of planting rights, we believe there must be a grubbing-up option.
In point of fact, if no indication is given that new planting will be authorised at some time in a given location, the decision to grub up there is not based on the quantity of wine that can be sold.
This linkage, in short, is imperative, and we support it.
When you speak of enrichment with grape must or sugar and say that there must be a shift in the balance between these two methods, that is fine by us, because it basically means that chaptalisation will remain legal.
If a compromise were found on that basis, we would regard it as an acceptable outcome.
Sugaring is an old oenological process.
We should therefore preserve it and reject the Americans' many unreasonable demands regarding our winemaking processes.
Provided that our amendments are carried, we shall support the rapporteur's draft in its entirety.
<D>
Mr President, the power of many of these fraudulent directory companies is that they are in another Member State, so they seem untouchable unless in some way the EU intervenes.
They also instil fear in people, many of them very small businesses without any legal help or advice and many, after being harassed for years, eventually give up and pay the money.
Like many of the other speakers, my office has been inundated with complaints, but usually from sole traders: plumbers, dentists, doctors, people who have been targeted by European City Guide.
These people feel as if they are on their own, that they have just made a bad decision, that they got caught out and in some way they almost blame themselves.
I find it unbelievable when I hear that the majority of Member States do not want any extension of the Directive to do something about the relations between companies.
I just wonder, is it because the companies that are being targeted are small businesses, that it is not the big corporations that are being affected?
I believe citizens need more and better from the Council and the Commission than they are getting at present.
I think the current situation is not good enough and I call on the Council to do something about it immediately.
<D>
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, indeed, our culture and media policy is about giving Europe a soul.
It has been quite rightly established, by Commission President Barroso amongst others, that people will not fall in love with the internal market - as important as it is - but want to see and enjoy cultural diversity, the cultural heritage of Europe.
They also want cultural diversity to be the ambassador of Europe in the world.
Mrs Pack was quite right when she said, using a sentence of Wim Wenders, that we need European images to tell European stories, to express the diversity of European history and of European sensibilities.
What was the tragedy of European history, and what are the great hopes of a peaceful and better future?
That is the basic cultural understanding of the European Union, which we not only want to cultivate internally but also need to convey to the outside world.
That is why European culture policy, and film policy in particular, is always an ambassador for European identity.
That is why I am pleased that we have succeeded in getting this programme off the ground.
I should like to say from the outset that, in the next parliamentary term, this programme must be extended, invigorated and injected with more finances, so that the MEDIA Mundus programme can really fulfil its role of making it clear, in international cooperation, what European values are and what European cultural diversity is.
There must also be co-productions, collaboration, training in the best sense of the word, a win-win situation which enriches both sides.
In this age of globalisation and digitalisation it will be the trademark of European policy on culture.
Today, I should also like to take this opportunity to thank Mrs Hieronymi for her very good cooperation and for succeeding in making it clear in this House that, while culture has an economic side, it is always more than just a commodity.
It is really about identity, diversity, cultural confrontation - in the best sense of the word.
Because that is what moves people in their hearts and minds.
Placing more trust in Europe than hitherto must be our obligation for the future.
For that reason, Mrs Hieronymi, I extend my sincerest thanks for your good cooperation and wish you all the best for the future.
(Applause)
<D>
in writing. - (RO) I appreciate very much the firmness and lack of doubt with which Mr. Barrot undertook to support the rights related to the European citizenship and, in particular, the freedom of movement, on the occasion of his hearing on Monday.
The rights and freedoms of the European citizens are the most important gains from the European integration and should not be jeopardized under any circumstance and no matter the reasons that might be invoked.
The citizens of the country I represent in this forum, Romania, watch carefully and with concern the discussions regarding the freedom of movement from certain Member States.
The Romanian citizens from abroad, who are, most of them, correct and hard-working workers, bring incontestable benefits to the economies of the countries where they work.
They - and I am convinced that they are not the only ones - are expecting the European Commission to play an active and firm role in defending the full freedom of movement.
I hope with all my heart that Mr. Barrot's entire mandate will stay under the sign of this commitment to defend the rights of the European citizens.
<D>
Mr President, thank you and congratulations to Mrs Miguélez Ramos for a very good report.
It is worth recalling that 70% of the world's surface is covered by oceans.
More than 97% of our planet's water is contained in the oceans.
The oceans provide 99% of the earth's living space and fish supply the highest percentage of the world's protein consumed by humans; 3.5 billion people depend on them for their primary source of food.
It does no harm to remind ourselves how important these fisheries debates are.
Sustainable management of our global fish stocks therefore needs to be a priority and we must constantly review how we do that management.
I agree with the Commission that there needs to be an ecosystem-based approach to the management of deep-sea fish stocks.
This in my view should facilitate the use of various approaches and tools, eliminating destructive fishing practices and the need to establish marine protected areas consistent with international law.
Management of the deep sea must also be based on the very best peer-reviewed science, which will include effective by-catch and data-collection programmes.
Furthermore, effective research relating to the mapping of the seabed and the natural resources of the oceans, especially in the light of climate change impacts, must be a priority.
I am very concerned at the current lack of sufficient data to carry out a scientific assessment of the state of our deep-sea fish stocks.
It is imperative that we introduce a ban on discards in deep-water fisheries as this would enable scientists to study with more precision the complex diversity of species being landed.
It is not sufficient simply to reduce discards, as bottom-trawling in deep water has a relatively high impact on by-catch and discard species.
I really do think that the debate around the definition of what is 'deep' is futile and I agree fully with the FAO dismissing it as a crude measure and a crude criterion which is very arbitrary in terms of the sustainability of the species and fish stocks.
<D>
We have voted today, in plenary, on a motion for a resolution on the work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in 2009.
The Joint Parliamentary Assembly met twice in 2009.
On these occasions, 10 resolutions and the Luanda Declaration on the second revision of the Cotonou Partnership Agreement were approved.
During the year, two regional meetings were also held, in Guyana (Caribbean region) and in Burkina Faso (West African region) respectively.
Despite this, 2009 was blighted by the decision, adopted by the ACP Council of Ministers in December 2008, to make radical cuts to the ACP secretariat budget earmarked for staff missions.
This decision considerably affected the possibility of guaranteeing services relating to JPA meetings held at sites other than Brussels.
In December 2009, the ACP Council adopted the necessary revisions to guarantee that the budget funding for 2010 was sufficient to cover two plenary sessions, one regional meeting and two additional missions at most.
Given the context, it is appropriate to continue to work within this sector and examine additional and innovative sources of development finance, namely, a tax on international financial transactions.
<D>
(RO) Mr President, Commissioner, dear MEPs, between 1995-2004 freight transport increased by 28%, and by 2020 a 50% increase is predicted.
58% of the freight transported is carried by road, 25% by rail and 17% by internal navigable waterways.
Dangerous goods represent 8% of the transported freight.
This transport type highly endangers the regions the goods are carried through and therefore, the European Union must take the necessary measures to increase the security of this transport type.
The existing laws in the European Union cover only the transport of dangerous goods by road and by rail, but for transport by sea there are only international conventions to which Member States are party.
Following Romania and Bulgaria's accession to the EU, almost the entire length of the Danube has become an internal navigable waterway.
The Danube runs through seven European capitals and nearby many urban agglomerations, that is why the safety of the transport of dangerous goods along Danube is extremely important.
It is essential that the measures on the transport of dangerous goods should be doubled with measures on the intervention of emergency services in cases of accidents where such transports are involved.
There is a huge number of victims, even among those who should intervene in the event of an accident.
Moreover, the transport of dangerous goods should be carried out during less crowded periods and routes, so that the related risks can be minimized.
I think that for the safety of the transport of dangerous goods a short a transition period as possible is needed in order to implement this Directive.
<D>
Thank you very much, Mr Barnier.
Our discussions have gone on a little too long.
It is very much to your credit that you have responded to each speaker.
However, perhaps in future, for educational reasons, we should agree that the final statement by the Commissioner will only respond to those speakers still actually in the Chamber.
This would save us a little time.
The last debate has actually taken us right to the limit of the time we have available to us.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
<D>
(PL) Mr President, thanks to the Lisbon Treaty, Europe can take up challenges which extend far beyond the internal problems of Member States.
Will Europe be ready to do so?
It is still hard to say.
It is certain that in this matter, much will depend on the citizens of Europe.
However, as well as the Treaty, the EU must also have the will to act and to have a world presence.
It must have a feeling of responsibility for the world, for its stability and development.
The EU's own security and development also depend on this.
We must resist the common metaphor of Europe as a safe, prosperous and democratic country which cherishes human rights, but which is taken up with its own internal affairs and has turned its back on the world.
The Treaty of Lisbon compels us to have a better understanding of the challenges which are before us.
Following the Irish 'Yes', a united Europe is now looking at Poland and the Czech Republic.
I do not have the slightest doubt that the Lisbon Treaty will soon come into force.
While we await the signatures of President Kaczyński and President Klaus, however, let us think about how the discussion progressed during the present reform, and let us draw conclusions from what happened.
We should prepare for the future.
We should prepare for further reforms, because the wonderful design we are creating - the European Union - is an idea which is not yet finished.
Finally, I would like to say one more thing - thank you, Ireland.
<D>
The global food problem is increasing rather than shrinking and affects all grassroots classes, not only in the less developed countries, but also in the more developed countries.
The main cause of this situation is that the basic criterion for the production of agricultural produce and food is profit rather than global food requirements.
The trading of foodstuffs on international exchanges has resulted in spiralling price increases and, hence, spiralling profits for the food multinationals, a perceptible reduction in rural output and global food reserves and an increase in the number of malnourished people.
In order to address this unacceptable situation, which condemns one billion people to malnourishment and starvation, the report confines itself to wish lists which are cancelled out by its insistence on abiding by the same policy: support for the common agricultural policy and its reviews and 'health check', the completion of negotiations in the World Trade Organization, the decoupling of aid from production and the continuing production of biofuels, on the pretext of the environment and using land which could be used to produce food.
It barely touches on the principles of food sovereignty and security and the right to self-sufficiency in food.
The MEPs from the Communist Party of Greece voted against the report because, despite its findings and 'wishes', it supports the anti-grassroots, pro-monopoly policy which is condemning more and more people to malnourishment and starvation.
<D>
I would like to highlight the importance of the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the coordination of procedures for the award of certain public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts in the fields of defence and security, which I strongly support.
The directive opens the way for basing public procurement in the field of security and defence on transparent criteria, without discriminating against tenderers from other EU Member States, whilst simultaneously guaranteeing the security of these countries.
That is why it is so important to be able to invoke the clause in the Treaty establishing the European Community which provides that its provisions may be disregarded if that step is necessary to protect the essential interests of an EU Member State.
Joint production, joint purchasing, public procurement -especially in terms of the most technologically advanced, and therefore more expensive, equipment - will give the European Security and Defence Policy a better chance of success.
The proposal for a directive, which I support, is a positive step towards opening up the markets of the EU Member States and reducing rivalry in the sector between countries which could make use of shared and cost-effective solutions.
At the same time, I would like to express my reservations regarding the order of preference of standards examined during the process of drawing up technical specifications for the purchase of defence equipment.
Defence ministers should be responsible for establishing implementation priorities.
Moreover, I also noted the lack of any reference in this proposal to the Code of Best Practice in the Supply Chain of the European Defence Agency, which is implemented by suppliers.
It is therefore not clear whether this criterion should continue to be taken into account when selecting suppliers.
<D>
(PL) Mr President, half way through this century the number of people living on our planet will exceed 9 billion.
In addition to population growth we shall see an increase in the demand for food, something we are short of even now - and not just in third countries, but in European countries too.
Europe and the world can look forward to a major food crisis.
The European Union's common agricultural policy, which is based on orders, prohibitions, quotas and contingents, has meant that some states profit from a food crisis while others lose out.
Only a few EU countries will come out well from this.
Sadly the great majority will suffer losses, including Poland - until recently the EU's third largest food producer, which in the past could have fed its population twice over.
Food shortages are going hand in glove with higher costs.
According to the World Bank, in the last three years food prices have risen by a total of 83%; they are still rising and they will continue to do so.
The International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the governments of many countries know that food shortages threaten the biological security of peoples.
Following interventions by numerous representatives, including some from Poland, the European Union released 2 900 000 hectares of fallow land for cereal production and increased the milk quota by 2%.
This did not solve the problem, though.
The short-sighted EU agricultural policy is still in place.
Processing plants are being closed, cultivation areas are dwindling, trees are being grown on arable land and many other actions are being taken that limit food production.
Who will provide us with healthy, cheap foods in the future?
American producers certainly will, although they will not be healthy, as they will be genetically modified.
Why, then, are we waiting?
We already know, surely, that the EU's agricultural policy as implemented to comply with the expectations of certain interest groups is a road to nowhere, or better, to a loss of biological security in the EU and a deterioration in the situation throughout the world.
We therefore need not only a review of the common agricultural policy, but also a re-negotiation of the treaties concluded and a new solution for the future.
<D>
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I attended meetings last week in Tbilisi together with my colleagues from the interparliamentary delegation, led by Mrs Isler Béguin, whose comments I fully endorse: the situation is really deteriorating and the escalating tensions could erupt in open armed confrontation.
During the official meeting, President Saakashvili confirmed that this time it could be a matter of hours rather than days.
The deadlock over the situation in Abkhazia and South Ossetia is being resolved and Moscow has officially confirmed that it wants to establish a legal relationship with each region.
This will reopen the debate over Georgia's territorial integrity, which has been recognised by UN resolutions.
The hope is that Europe will eventually have one voice and play a more decisive role in the search for peaceful solutions, before it is too late.
If relationships break down, it is all too easy to predict a series of chain reactions throughout the region, events that would eventually reach our borders.
We therefore hope for a real commitment in this regard from the Council and the Commission.
Either we address the situation and redouble our efforts at mediation, or unfortunately we will have the terrible responsibility of not having desired or been able to do enough.
<D>
(EL) Madam President, the transition to a new Strategic Partnership between the EU and Russia is not an easy undertaking.
It is hampered by successive divergences, which are sometimes a source of considerable tension.
Over-dramatisation of these divergences allows the constraining patterns of the past to re-emerge, makes the present uncertain and hinders constructive progress.
Some reasonable questions may be asked about the EU-Russia partnership.
Has Russia come to terms with the reality of the enlarged Union?
Has the Union got over its teething troubles with expansion in the east?
Do the new Member States feel they are participating in an effective European security system?
How is the Union responding to Russia's attempt to redefine and strengthen its new role in the international balance of powers?
Will the two sides continue in a climate of distrust and 'quiet diplomacy', or will they seek to achieve common action plans?
Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that sector-based approaches alone are not the best option.
The declared aim of creating four common spaces must remain politically binding, and likewise the aim of Russia's accession to the WTO.
Broad, robust partnership structures are therefore needed for cooperation in the areas of: economic issues; freedom, security and justice; external security; and research, education and culture.
Russophobia is inappropriate for an EU based on democracy, the rule of law and fundamental freedoms.
I understand the sensitivities among some citizens of the new Member States, but over-emphasis on past experiences may cast doubt on the prospects for transparent political cooperation and close institutional interconnection.
President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, it is in the mutual interests of the Union and Russia to set common political and economic targets for the sake of democratic principle, peace, stability and security.

A selective approach to visa lifting will not strengthen the European prospects of any Western Balkan country whose communities are divided, because selectivity brings with it new divisions.
I welcome every move that combats selectivity and firmly believe that lifting visa requirements for all those countries would certainly help improve the image of the European Union in the eyes of the people in these countries who need an opening on the world after years of conflict.
I would also like to point out that there are thousands of young people living in these countries who have never been able to travel abroad.
Their only source of knowledge about Europe and the world is television.
We have an obligation to strengthen their European prospects as well.
I am aware of the security considerations, but those leaving their countries with ill intentions will find a way to cross into the EU anyway.
However, we are holding back hundreds of thousands of those who have good intentions.
I would, therefore, urge the Council and the Commission to review their positions as soon as possible, to follow up the progress in these countries, and to lift visa requirements for the countries which were not included in the first group.
Thank you very much.
Naturally, I call on the governments of these Western Balkan countries to fulfil their obligations as soon as possible, in the interests of their citizens and their EU accession prospects.

(EL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the battle against climate change and the need for energy security and to strengthen the competitiveness of our economy are taking us down the road of the third industrial revolution, towards an era in which we wean ourselves off mineral fuels.
It is a real revolution which will bring about huge structural changes to the model of production and consumption and, ultimately, to our very way of life.
I trust that, as the European Union, we shall maintain global leadership in this revolution.
In order for that to happen, we shall need to make every possible effort to limit the energy intensity of the economy in all sectors.
One of the tools for improving energy efficiency is to make use of the potential of information and communication technologies (ICT).
Considerable incentives are needed in order for us to make use of these technologies, so that we increase the energy efficiency of the European Union by 20% by 2020, within the framework of the 20-20-20 target.
The motion which we are being called on to adopt in a couple of days' time and which relates to the strengthening of energy efficiency through ICT places particular emphasis on research and development of pioneering technologies, such as nano-technologies and photonic technology, which have high potential to improve energy efficiency, and on designing policies to strengthen the take-up of these technologies.
Similarly, it also gives considerable impetus to more green innovation and entrepreneurship, with a series of measures and actions.
I would refer in particular to green public procurements, which will allow public sector agencies to play a leading role in saving energy by making use of the new technological applications of ICT.
Finally, the motion provides for incentives for smart and integrated energy management systems in our cities and for smart traffic management systems with more rational road behaviour and transport systems.
It is clear from what I have said that, although it is not legislative, this motion which we shall vote on in a couple of days' time is highly important, because it essentially makes ICT one of the main indicators of sustainable development in the European Union.
I therefore call on you to support it in the vote in a couple of days' time.

Mr President, in the six weeks since the election of Mr Christofias as the new President of Cyprus, more progress has been made towards trying to find a lasting solution on the island than in the previous four years.
The atmosphere in Cyprus is full of renewed hope, but one thing is threatening to destroy the euphoric climate.
This is the continued interference of the Turkish Army.
A week ago the Chief of Staff of the Turkish Army paid a sudden visit to Cyprus and made a number of inflammatory statements that almost stopped the peace process in its tracks.
Today, the commander of the Turkish land forces was due to go to Cyprus and his presence is expected to create more problems for the peace negotiations.
I urge the President of this House and all my colleagues to use any diplomatic means at their disposal to strongly point out to the Turkish generals in Ankara that they should stop trying to destroy the peace dialogue in Cyprus and leave the Cypriots free to get on with the job of finding a solution to their island's intercommunal problems.
Thank you, and may I also say, Mr President, how grateful we all are for your generosity in allowing so many people to speak this afternoon.
<D>
(EL) Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the priorities of your Presidency include the following: in order for the European Union to take international action, it needs to tie its security in with strategic cooperation with ΝΑΤΟ and to develop its own defence capability to complement ΝΑΤΟ.
The citizens are wondering who is threatening the European Union to the extent that it needs to tie its security in with ΝΑΤΟ?
On the contrary, a visible threat to the European Union is the strategy being applied by Israel, the strategy of war, which the European Union has not roundly condemned and for which it has not imposed sanctions, as it has done in other cases.
You further state that you want an economy without borders and that excessive regulation should be avoided, that an increase in the level of protectionism should be avoided.
Are these the lessons that we, as the European Union, have learned from the economic crisis?
No protection for the weak and market speculation?
It is hardly surprising, therefore, that the citizens are losing patience with the policies of the European Union.
The Euro-barometer, which we always ignore, tells us as much.
What is topical today and what the mass demonstrations are highlighting is the need for a policy of peace, not complicit neutrality.
The reactions and the grassroots protest are blatant proof of the need for justice and for political control of the market and of the price of commodities which will allow each state to perform the social role which its citizens allocate to it without the dogmatic limitations of the Stability Pact.
<D>
Mr President, there are fundamental flaws in how the EC is currently proceeding in justice and home affairs, notably the lack of fully transparent and democratic law-making in the absence of the Lisbon Treaty (I too regret that Mr Jouyet showed his indifference to our views by leaving, whether he apologised or not) and, secondly, the lack of balance and respect for fundamental rights.
Both are, unfortunately, fully on display here in the two measures being discussed.
The criminalising of 'public provocation to commit terrorism' - a vague term - risks casting a chilling effect on free speech when the criminal offence of incitement, which we already have, is perfectly adequate.
The other measure gives only weak protection for personal data exchanged ostensibly for law-enforcement purposes, but with massive loopholes.
I can inform the House that, in the UK, the Data Retention Directive - that landmark achievement of the UK presidency three years ago - is being used to give hundreds of non-law-enforcement agencies access to personal contact details.
Local councils use it to check up if parents have lied about living in the catchment area of a popular school - which might be naughty, but is not a major crime.
It is disgraceful the way that interior ministers have left a space for Europhobes like the UK Independence Party and British Conservatives to castigate the whole EU effort on cross-border crime.
We know that a large majority of the European public, including in the UK, supports EU action to catch criminals and terrorists, such as through the European arrest warrant.
However, UKIP and the Tories, who claim to put a high priority on law and order, give a cheery wave goodbye to any criminal who escapes across the Channel.
We should not allow them to get away with their propaganda, especially because interior ministers are doing their very best to undermine public support for police cooperation by their blinkered approach which gives insufficient attention to civil liberties, be this protection from invasions of privacy or the rights of defendants.
EU Governments have stupidly allowed Mr Batten and his ilk a head of steam over the issue of recognition of judgments in absentia by their failure, led by the UK Government, to strengthen defence rights.
Talk about an unholy alliance between the Europhobes and a spineless Labour Government!
Lastly, I want to ask where the justice ministers are in this whole exercise.
They need to get a grip on the interior ministers' circus and start to construct a real European area of freedom, security and justice.
We need the Lisbon Treaty to get transparency and democracy into this project, and quickly, before the European elections.
<D>
The report which Mrs Muscardini has presented concerns an important economic and social question.
It is significant especially now, in the face of economic collapse.
The number of SMEs (up to 250 employees; turnover ≤ EUR 50 million) in the EU reaches 23 million, which comprises around 99% of all firms active in our market.
Over 75 million people work in these SMEs.
The calls directed to the Commission, Member States and regional and local authorities for effective support of these businesses, including unhindered access to loans, are therefore justified.
In addition, trade needs to be made easier and bureaucratic export and import barriers need to be lifted.
In relation to public procurement, whose complicated and not always unequivocal procedures hinder the access of SMEs, the market should be made more open, both inside the EU and in third countries.
As I have shown in my report on innovation policy, the role of SMEs in this sector is difficult to overestimate.
This is because they are more flexible and open to modern technologies and organisational methods.
Special treatment is required for SMEs in the agriculture and food sector, where care needs to be taken over protection of the designations of origin of products, and imitations which are harmful to the health of consumers need to be resisted.
I also endorse the idea of organising European SMP Week in May 2009.
This should be a good opportunity to make a wide range of information on the subject available throughout the EU.
<D>
(FI) Madam President, firstly I wish to express my satisfaction with this report.
It is excellent that we are adopting a clear position against passive smoking.
I voted for this report because it is high time we acted at European Union level to prevent people from actually being exposed to the dangers of tobacco smoke.
As we heard earlier, 650 000 people die each year from the effects of smoking.
It is time to take action.
Despite my support for the proposal, I know that it will be difficult to put into practice and implement everywhere.
Article 11 incorporates the notion that smoking should be banned in private cars everywhere in the EU if underage children are present.
This is a good aim, but we have to consider how it might be monitored.
A smoke-free environment is a goal we should strive for, but in future we will need to pay more attention to ensuring that the action we take is reasonable and that compliance with the law can be monitored.
<D>
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, I am very pleased indeed to have this opportunity to discuss this debate.
It is only unfortunate that we are doing it on a Thursday afternoon when it is not quite as well attended as perhaps it should be.
I do think this is an important debate in the context of the current economic climate.
We have already heard discussion about culture and jobs and how culture industries and people working in culture can contribute to the economy and can really help.
At the precarious times we are facing now - which we have heard already in this Parliament - it is important that we discuss these matters as fully as we can.
I am here also because I do actually represent one of those big cities that the previous speaker mentioned.
London, as you all know, is one of the cultural centres of the EU with - as we all have - enormous history and very much to offer.
It is also the centre of, certainly the British, cultural industries.
So I think I have a role here to speak for the people that I represent and to fight for those jobs which, when things get bad, are very often the first jobs to go.
So I very much welcome what the Commission has said about the role of cultural industries, about how we want to preserve and to build on those and how there is an economic role for culture.
I feel that, very often, that economic role is ignored, and we do not talk about it; we do not even think about it, and we relegate culture to second-class status.
That is not acceptable, particularly when culture can be so very important in our national and regional development.
I hope that one of the things to come out of this debate today - that we take back to our Member States, and the Commission and the Council take back - is that we are very concerned about how this regional development happens, how we deal with this and the role that culture can play in that.
Also, as Mrs Pack has already said, there is the whole question of cultural diversity.
I think one of the great strengths of the EU, and of the European Parliament, is that we all come together - now with 27 Member States - and are actually very different, in many ways: different backgrounds and cultures, and obviously different languages.
That is just a start.
Although the world is getting smaller and although people come together more, there are still these significant differences.
We should be celebrating them, because those differences are at the very core of the things that we talk about.
We all want to preserve our identities and how we feel about ourselves, and we need to do that.
In this context, I think we also need to take on board that we are getting people coming into our continent.
We are getting people from other parts of the world - many of whom are now in second and third generations in some of our Member States - who come from different backgrounds again.
I think we also need to take on board that they come with their own culture, tradition and languages.
Although we integrate them and they learn our languages, they are still there with their own separate identities.
That is an issue which has not been mentioned in this debate, which I think is an important one and one that we, I hope, can integrate, particularly when we talk about issues such as multilingualism, which we have had good debates on.
It is an extremely important issue, and I think one we should perhaps give more prominence to than we have done, but in the context of a Europe which is changing.
We therefore need to preserve our existing cultures and our existing diversity and actually absorb the new diversity which has come, and which is continuing to come, into our continent.
For all of these reasons, I welcome the support that we are giving to culture and to cultural industries, support to small and medium-enterprises, which I think - in the current economic climate - are possibly going to be the backbone of what we will be looking at.
If large corporations and large enterprises are losing people, making people redundant and laying people off, it may well be up to the smaller outfits - the SMEs - to pick up this slack and to actually go out there and create employment for those who can work in this sector.
So I hope we will all recognise just how important the role of culture is in our continent and our society and that those of us who have actually turned up for this debate will take the message back to our Member States, to the regions and to the people we represent.
I know we have got a good message to say, so let us go out there and spread the word.
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, this report is a serious, thorough and inspirational piece of work.
The rapporteur has rallied support across the Committee on Foreign Affairs but also across the other four committees that we have just heard from.
In my view it will meet with widespread acclamation tomorrow, including my own support, and, I am very happy to say, that of my British colleagues.
Commissioner Piebalgs, you went a very long way in your introduction to support the initiative that the Committee chairman, Mr Saryusz-Wolski, has raised with, as I say, a lot of innovation and skill, because, to many, there were challenges.
I have two specific questions to which perhaps you might reply.
You stated, in terms of one of our major suppliers, Russia, that you look forward to a new agreement under the action plan.
What is wrong with the old agreement that Russia has actually signed, the Energy Charter, including the Transit Protocol?
Because, if our neighbours and suppliers, with whom we have mutual dependency, constantly renege on agreements, what confidence can we have in the future?
We are looking for harmonious relations, but we have to defend our own corner and not merely agree with those who are in a supply situation.
I disagree with Ms Ek in her reservations - perhaps she might listen - about the High Official.
It seems to me that Mr Saryusz-Wolski is absolutely right in that we must have an institutional representative, whether it is yourself or whether it is, as we foresee, a double-hatted responsibility - both the Commission and Council.
I disagree thoroughly with Ms Ek.
This increases transparency, because Parliament would have a direct contact in the Vice-President of the Commission role of this High Official.
Could you dwell, in your reply, a little bit on this institutional issue, which seems to me to be extremely important and which Parliament is going to stress very strongly?
<D>
We voted against the report because they did not even accept a proposal relating to concern about the abuses of market domination by big business, particularly with regard to the big supermarket chains.
These abuse their purchasing power to force down prices paid to suppliers in the European Union and in third countries.
Nor did they demonstrate the necessary determination to investigate the impact that the concentration of the supermarket sector is having on small businesses, suppliers, workers and consumers.
In particular, they failed to evaluate the abuses of purchasing power which may follow from such concentration.
The resolution adopted continues the pattern of intervention in defence of competition and against public services.
It follows in the footsteps of the notorious Bolkestein Directive, always insisting on the need to comply with the rules of the internal market.
Also, regrettably, even as it speaks of the crisis and the difficulties faced by economies, it insists on the Commission being vigilant so that competition is not called into question.
In other words, faced with the crisis caused by neoliberal capitalism, the solution is more of the same.
That is unacceptable.
<D>
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I am a little surprised by the President-in-Office's speech tonight, as indeed I am by its delivery from the podium d'honneur.
The conflict in the Caucasus is one for which both sides must take responsibility, as you have said, President-in-Office.
So why do the Council's conclusions not reflect this?
President Saakashvili cannot have believed that military intervention would evoke no response from Russia.
Equally, Russia's reaction was disproportionate.
You said, 'Les dégâts n'ont pas été considérables,' and yet Commissioner Ferrero Waldner has given us the figures and this House will be called on to agree to pay the bill!
On one thing we do agree with you: we must condemn Russia's actions; they are indefensible, but we will not dissuade the Russian bear by backing Medvedev into a corner.
Dialogue and engagement will defuse tensions better than isolation.
That is the lesson of the Cold War, and the Union - as with the Helsinki Process - has a central role to play.
This conflict highlights the need for us to build a common foreign and security policy.
And though Member States hold diffuse views about Russia, your presidency was quick to negotiate its six-point plan and for that credit is due.
The plan may not be perfect, but it has brought an end to violence and it should be fully implemented, including Russian withdrawal from the Black Sea port of Poti.
But what steps should the Union take now?
The Council is right to agree a crisis-management and reconstruction fund and the rapid deployment of humanitarian assistance.
Now it must designate an EU representative who will make both sides listen.
The Union is right to send observers, but they must replace Russian peacekeepers, which will mean commitment from those Member States which are not already stretched militarily on other fronts.
Europe should convene a trans-Caucasian peace conference, bringing together all sides in the search for the settlement of unresolved conflicts.
But the Union should start in one area of glaring inconsistency which requires little more than ministerial fiat to fix.
End the anomaly whereby Georgian citizens with Russian passports have freer access to the European Union, because this encourages them to adopt Russian citizenship.
Georgians should have the same access to Europe as Russians, although this could be achieved by freezing the visa facilitation agreement with Russia.
In strengthening our neighbourhood policy, how can we ensure continued cooperation with Russia while showing that a full 'strategic partnership' is no longer credible?
What more can we do to cut Europe's dependence on Russia's energy supplies?
You did well to strengthen the text of your conclusions in that regard.
Russia must of course face the consequences of its illegal actions, perhaps including a discussion on the future of the Sochi Winter Olympics just 40 km from the border.
Can Russia's behaviour be considered in keeping with the Olympic Charter?
No.
Solving these matters requires determination, foresight and patience.
That is a challenge that this Union must meet and I am afraid, President-in-Office, one that we must meet before we offer you your vin d'honneur.
<D>
Mr President, in the US there has been warning of the effect of alcohol on babies in utero for 20 years because they had a problem with alcohol-related harm.
Only 20% of American mothers-to-be drink in pregnancy.
In Europe, we do not label.
Eighty per cent of Irish mothers drink.
Seventy per cent of mothers in the UK drink.
I know mothers in Ireland.
I know that many of them would not drink if they understood the harm.
Labelling may not be an instant solution, but, over time, it is proved by the US experience that it has an effect and brings down foetal harm.
For adults, moderation is the key word, but for the child before birth there is no safe level.
Even low consumption can create organic brain damage that results in hyperactivity, impulsivity and even an increased risk of suicide.
There are learning and coordination difficulties as well.
One of the results of foetal alcohol exposure is a tendency for the child to grow up and to binge drink when he or she gets older.
That shows it becomes self perpetuating.
It is time to break this cycle.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I can tell you that the cereal market outlook is clearly at the forefront of our minds, as we are in a situation where the prices have shown unprecedented growth in the recent months.
This is not only the case within the European Union but all over the world.
With too much rain in certain parts of Europe and with droughts in other parts of Europe, the climatic conditions within our own regions this year have been adverse to cereal production and, with an estimated output of 258 million tonnes, the 2007 harvest is below average.
A compulsory set-aside of the present 10% in the old Member States, the EU-15, is not compatible with the present market situation.
Against this background, the Commission has proposed to set 0% on set-aside for the autumn 2007 harvest and the sowing in spring 2008.
According to our estimates, this will mean extra production within the European Union of between 10 and 17 million tonnes, and I think this will send a positive signal to the sector and, hopefully, also contribute to stabilisation within the grain sector.
A rapid decision on this matter is clearly needed so that farmers can decide their next production year and, in this context, I am actually very thankful for the fact that Parliament obviously understood the urgency of the matter and agreed to follow the fast-track procedure.
I really am very grateful.
Finally, our legal proposal will be as short and as simple as possible and it will not imply any new administrative burdens.
Looking further ahead, it is necessary, within the health check, to take a good look at whether the set-aside is still an appropriate tool in the present and in the future market circumstances.
We also need to consider how we can retain the environmental benefits within our set-aside system, such as maintenance of permanent pastures, the protection of riparian strips and measures that are also linked to climate change.
So, thank you for a quick reaction.
It is nice to see that Parliament can really move when it is badly needed.
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (PT) Madam President, Commissioner, it is rightly stated in the report under discussion - and I must here congratulate the rapporteur - that the tourism sector is at the crosswords of numerous European Union policies and has a substantial impact on growth and employment and also on social and territorial cohesion.
It is therefore essential to realise certain aspects of tourism policy, following the definition of the guiding principles in Parliament's resolution of 8 September 2005 for which I was the rapporteur.
The first aspect concerns simplifying and harmonising the tourist visa application procedures for entry into the Member States, with a view to reducing their costs and facilitating access to the European Union for tourists from third countries.
However, we feel it is right, if not essential, to maintain the security rules required in order to combat terrorism, organised crime and illegal immigration.
We also see a need to modernise the system for collecting statistical information, including the Satellite Accounts, as it is only with up-to-date and trustworthy data that the public authorities and industry can take the key strategic decisions which will allow Europe to maintain its current leading position.
I also have a point to make on the rather more contentious issue of a possible harmonisation of quality standards for tourist accommodation in Europe.
The multiplicity of classification schemes for hotels must be combined with the issue of protecting the rights and expectations of tourists when making their choices.
Will it be possible to establish, in the European Union, minimum standards for safety and quality which guarantee the reliability and transparency of information provided to these consumers?
This is certainly desirable but we feel that it will only be possible on a voluntary basis and by inviting all the stakeholders to take part in this work.
The Commission may, if it so wishes, assume a fundamental driving role in this.
There is not enough time to mention other equally important aspects of this report, including accessible tourism for tourists with reduced mobility, passenger rights or the external promotion of European destinations and the development of sustainable policies.
However, it has been adequately demonstrated, and I will end on this point, that the European Parliament has done its work and we hope that the other public bodies, in partnership with the private sector, will reinforce their spirit of cooperation and respond effectively to the challenges of developing a renewed and sustainable EU tourism policy.
<D>
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, what concerns us most in this debate are the workers in the car industry.
The figures are so huge that it is hard to imagine the scale of the problem.
In your speech, Commissioner, you made one of the alarming issues very clear, which is that in contrast to this there are also the figures relating to the appalling levels of overproduction and the striking failure to innovate in the areas of efficiency and climate protection.
If we are now prepared to give the car industry state aid, this must be dependent on the funding being used to secure jobs and to create sustainable employment.
In addition, it must be conditional on these companies genuinely focusing on innovation.
Something which makes me a little suspicious, Commissioner, is the considerable influence of the CARS 21 group and the influence of the industry in the process which is being kick-started here.
I am familiar with some German car companies and I am aware that they have been putting the brakes on when it comes to climate protection and efficiency.
I have also noticed with great interest that a new exemption was requested two weeks ago to suspend environmental requirements.
This must not happen.
The aid must be dependent on conditions such as the provision of jobs, genuine innovation, training and skills development for employees and this applies to suppliers, in other words, the many SMEs which depend on the large organisations, and to the workers in the car industry.
My group would be happy with that.
However, without these strict conditions, we will not be contributing to the creation of sustainable jobs.
<D>
Two different questions have been asked.
First, on the question of the floods, I came as the Commissioner for the Internal Market and Services to reply to a specific question, Mr Kelly, which was as follows: how can best use be made of insurance policies, particularly to compensate people whose personal property has been affected?
I am going to work on this snapshot of the various more or less sophisticated private insurance schemes, where some countries have hardly any insurance for this type of disaster and others, such as France, have a scheme that pays 100% compensation in the event of a natural disaster.
Flooding, Mr Kelly, is not an issue for which I have responsibility.
I am going to ask Mr Potočnik, my colleague with responsibility for the environment, to give you a written answer informing you of how this directive on flooding is or is not being applied.
You are right, however, that the key issue lies in national and even regional or local powers in the areas of building or suitability for building.
One cannot ask Brussels for everything, although the general rule is obvious: there are areas where building or further building should not occur.
I even had a law passed in my country to move housing and factories located in areas that were regularly affected by flooding.
I had a law passed in 1995, and people are compensated so that they leave before another disaster occurs.
Those are the ideas that I would like to bring together before coming back to you with some proposals on the issue of insurance policies.
I would like to say a final word on the issue of civil protection, even though the issue falls within the remit of other colleagues.
It is an issue on which I did some work - as you know - which was supported by the European Parliament, at the request of President Barroso, in 2006.
This work led me to propose the creation of a European civil protection force provided by Member States on a voluntary basis.
We could introduce enhanced cooperation, starting from the bottom up, to get used to preparing our responses.
When there is a tsunami or a tragedy in Haiti, it is never goodwill that we lack, but coordination.
Human lives would be saved, time would be saved, money would be saved and, at the same time, there would be increased visibility if the European volunteers were to prepare their responses to the various categories of disasters.
Naturally, the responses cannot be the same for an industrial disaster, for a disaster such as the Erika, for flooding in Germany or France, for fires in Greece, for a tsunami, for major pandemics or even for a terrorist attack such as 11 September, which could still unfortunately occur in Europe.
The aim of this idea on which my colleagues are working - we shall come back to you with some concrete proposals - is to prepare a joint planned response.
In any case, I remain very attached to this idea on which I have done a great deal of work with the support of the European Parliament.
Subject: European action to combat poverty
According to Eurostat, around 85 million European citizens, 20% of children and 19% of European citizens over 65, were at risk of poverty in 2008.
At EU level, 8% of the active population and 44% of unemployed people had an income below the poverty threshold, and having a job is not sufficient to guarantee a decent standard of living.
Social protection measures in the Member States have cut the risk of poverty facing the EU population by 32%.
The economic crisis has led to a rise in the unemployment rate to around 10% and widening social gaps.
Can the Commission say what measures it plans to take to create and preserve jobs in the EU and to guarantee a decent standard of living for all EU citizens through a sound and adequate social protection system?
<D>
Mr Gallagher, I cannot trespass on the beginning of the next session.
I have already indicated to Mr Posselt that I will take his question and to Mrs Ţicău that I would take her question, and indeed the question from the three of you would have been the last one if we had been going quicker, but we are not.
It is difficult for me now to take even Mr Posselt's question.
That is the reality.
I am really sorry and, as I said, I am angry but this is the situation we have been put in.
You have seen what has happened all day with the agenda and it is not satisfactory.
So I would like, if I may, to move, as I said, to the question put to Commissioner De Gucht and to be answered by Mr Šemeta, and I say with much regret that that will be the last question this evening.
Subject: External trade and the Eastern Partnership
What is the Commission's assessment of the development of trade between the EU and Eastern Partnership countries, and what is the role of the Black Sea strategy and the countries of the Southern Caucasus in this?
<D>
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, you said that you would propose to the Conference of Presidents and to the Bureau that we summarise the five reports and the essential explanations in a booklet.
This is an excellent idea and one that I can only welcome.
I would recommend that we also include the Corbett/Méndez de Vigo report, which was the basis for our work on the Treaty of Lisbon.
At that time, we had 500 votes in favour, which was a record result.
It is part of the process.
It was the starting point for this attempt, after the Constitutional Treaty, to get the Reform Treaty in place.
I find the idea very good.
You have our full support.
You have already thanked a few who are unfortunately no longer with us.
I can safely say that all the members of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs have worked well together.
We have always been a committee with strong participation.
At this juncture I thank once again those who are currently present in the Chamber.
First, I thank Johannes Voggenhuber, a veritable cornerstone of our work for democracy and civil rights.
Sylvia Kaufmann, who has already been mentioned on a number of occasions, has been particularly effective in expressing her opinion in the face of a great deal of resistance in her political environment.
Carlos Carnero González was always with us.
He fought for the Constitution and also for the referendum in Spain.
Assunção Esteves was always very active.
Alain Lamassoure has achieved an enormous amount, including for the Constitution.
And, last but not least - although she is not a member of the Committee - Catherine Guy-Quint.
She has done substantial work in the Committee on Budgets and always supported the idea of Parliament being given more responsibilities and more rights.
I thank you all.
I have mentioned those present today who will not be with us next time.
We promise to continue their work.
As spokesperson for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament I wish to make two more comments on the reports.
As regards the Kaufmann report, we have always argued that the Citizens' Initiative is neither a placebo nor an alibi, but a serious constitutional instrument, with which the citizens can put issues on the agenda in Brussels.
I believe that, when the Citizens' Initiative is implemented, we will ensure that it remains so.
The Commission should exercise its right of initiative and draft a bill very soon after the reorganisation.
As regards the Dehaene report, I would once again like to mention the transitional period.
We want the spirit of Lisbon to be present during the consultations for the Council proposal for the new Commission President.
But the entire College of Commissioners, including the President, will not be confirmed until the treaty comes into force.
We will in effect vote twice on the President of the Commission.
It is important to remember that.
It is simply what the transitional period entails.
I think that the programme Mr Dehaene has produced for the legislative period is very good.
The starting point is the citizens' vote at the European elections, followed by all staffing decisions, political programmes and the financing of the European Union.
The starting position is the vote of the sovereign states, of the citizens in the European Union.
I find that really good.
Thank you, Mr Dehaene.

(SV) Madam President, there are those who believe that we should have a resolution on Moldova and there are those who believe that we should not.
Those who do not want this resolution often cite the fact that the OSCE actually approved the election itself.
Let me say, though, that the OSCE report was not completely uncritical.
On the contrary, it contained a great deal of criticism.
However, the resolution is not only about the election, but also about what happened after the election and what has been going on in Moldova for quite a while.
Human rights must be respected.
The media must be given freedom.
Maltreatment of peaceful demonstrators can never be accepted.
Approval of this resolution would mean that we would be sending a strong signal to people in Moldova to show them they are not alone, that we can see what is happening there and that we do not accept it.
I therefore urge you all to support this resolution.
<D>
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, I thank the Commissioner and Mr Vondra, for the Council, for their explanation, but I am certain they felt that there is still some hesitation on our part in giving them our full support.
I think it is easy to understand, because we have a very simple case.
The difficulty arises because for the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA), Parliament will have to give its assent, whereas this is not the case for the Interim Trade Agreement because of our legal obligations.
Because of this, when it comes to the Interim Trade Agreement, in our resolution we can only highlight our points and raise our concerns and give support with regard to certain topics; but because of this Parliament, and specifically my political group, is hesitating in giving its full support for the Interim Trade Agreement.
I hope this is understandable to you and I hope you can solve the problem.
I know that, because of the legal process and, because you have already signed the legal basis, it is very difficult, if not impossible, for you to renegotiate.
We are fully aware of the facts, but I am certain you can find some form of commitment and look into further developing and exploring legal bases on which you can help our side to be on your side, because we all recognise how important Turkmenistan is and we have already given support with regard to other agreements.
So it is not that we are not fully aware of what has happened and it is not the case that we are not aware how important Turkmenistan is, but it is a very problematic case.
I would like you to look into this again and that is why I specifically ask you to do me a favour: look into our paragraph 11, where we raise our concern with regard to the legal obligation and the differences between the Interim Trade Agreement and the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement.
Please recognise paragraph 9 of our resolution, which talks about the inclusion of the human rights clause in the PCA agreement.
Commissioner, I am aware of and took note of your points, but I am certain there is something you can do to further explore how we can strengthen this particular point.
The same is true for paragraph 10, and this is important for the Council as well.
We would like to see a revision clause.
I know it is not included but, again, please do us a favour, look into it and see what you can do when you continue to negotiate.
If you could do something about paragraph 8, this would be more than helpful for us; it relates to monitoring which we always like to have and which we are constantly asking for.
Monitoring does not mean that we want to sit at the negotiating table.
We have done this under other circumstances, so look at what you can do here, how you can be helpful in defining what monitoring means, but do us a favour and look at the case.
By the way, I think you have done great work.
All the points are covered in the new EU-Central Asia Partnership Agreement for the 21st century.
You even covered the ILO recommendation.
You covered human right issues so I am certain we can find a compromise, but a little bit of work still needs to be done.
<D>
(FR) Mr President, this is indeed a rather solemn day: the Lisbon package - as it is called - is finally coming before Parliament; the Czech Senate has given a sign of hope; many are taking the floor for the last time, the emotion is palpable; we are in the process of bringing this parliamentary term to a close, and many of us are quite emotional.
A really historic atmosphere prevails in this late-night session of Parliament.
As a Janus Member - half constitutional, half budgetary - I would like today to speak a little more specifically about Mrs Guy-Quint's report on the new budget system and about the impact that the Treaty of Lisbon will have on this new system.
As has been said, it is above all a more democratic system.
Henceforth, all spending - the entire budget - will be agreed under the codecision procedure between the Council and Parliament.
It is also, and this is even more important, a more political budget, since we have - as Mrs Guy-Quint calls it - interinstitutional strategic programming, in other words, all of the bodies of the European Union agree to bring the budget into being.
However, this is a system that still contains uncertainties.
Will Parliament, for example, really play what is, in theory, its strengthened role?
Will it enjoy this new power, given that there are also problems?
We have less time; there is only a single reading.
It is therefore up to Parliament to seize - and this is a challenge in itself - this opportunity to play its role.
Will the five-year budgetary term coincide with or be accentuated by the five-year parliamentary term?
It is not certain.
On this issue, too, we need to make an effort.
There are also lost opportunities.
We lost the opportunity to provide ourselves with more own resources, we lost the opportunity - please allow me 10 more seconds, since we are in a formal late-night sitting - to implement a new budget philosophy.
To end, I would like to stress that we face challenges: the challenge of the transition - it is not easy to go straight over to a new system - and the challenge of flexibility - we need more flexibility if we are to face up to the crises.
I will finish with the wish that all this might be carried forward with the implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon.
<D>
(RO) We are awaiting with interest the adoption of the European legal framework for small and medium-sized enterprises.
The EU economic recovery plan will open up new sources of funding for financing small and medium-sized enterprises.
Reducing the administrative burden, financing professional training and creating the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund are measures which will help protect jobs and promote entrepreneurship.
The European Investment Bank will make available EUR 30 billion to finance loans requested by SMEs.
However, I feel that this amount is not sufficient.
I think that at this time of crisis the following urgent measures need to be taken: procedures for granting state aid should be simplified; the period for founding a company should be limited to three days; and the settlement by public institutions of payments owing to SMEs should be guaranteed within a maximum period of 30 days.
I welcome the proposal from the Commission to promote the use of electronic invoicing, an investment estimated at EUR 18 billion.
It is also becoming necessary to develop competitive clusters based on companies investing in research and the development of new technologies.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are preparing the summit, and I do not expect this summit to spring any surprises.
I do expect it, however, to open doors to the future and to position the European Union on many issues.
The first door it must open is the door to ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon.
We expect ratification to be effected quickly in all Member States and the result of the 2009 elections to the European Parliament to be taken into account in the appointment of office-holders pursuant to the new Treaty.
I also expect, however, that clearing the way for ratification will also mean that the Council and Commission finally begin to communicate and provide information on the content of the Treaty in the Member States.
Do not remain silent about the reasons why we support this Treaty.
We welcome it because it strengthens our citizens, our parliaments, democracy and the European Union.
The second door we are opening is the door to freedom.
Schengen will be discussed.
We are pleased that more Member States now fulfil the Schengen criteria, because meeting the Schengen criteria means more freedom within the European Union and greater freedom for citizens of the European Union.
Thirdly, the door will, I hope, be opened to enable the European Union to assume more global responsibility.
Let me therefore say plainly that the scope for a negotiated solution to the Kosovo question has been exhausted and that the European Union must jointly assume responsibility for Kosovo.
It is our unequivocal view that the future of Kosovo and Serbia lies in the European Union and that we must make every effort to ensure that people's desire to be free and to live in peace with each other is satisfied.
My last point concerns the door to research and technology.
Implement the Galileo decision, which could only be taken because the European Union shouldered its financial responsibility.
<D>
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not agree with what has been said about food prices rocketing.
It seems absurd to me that anyone is thinking of feeding developing countries by making them grow plants for fuel rather than food.
I cannot support the pro-GMO lobby at all, because biofuels are one thing and foods are another, and what especially concerns me is the monopoly outside Europe on patents and seeds that makes many highly dependent on the United States and European farmers.
In my opinion, the rise in prices is not due either to climate change or to fuel being expensive, which - though it has an impact - does not do so to the extent that people are saying; it should be pointed out among other things that we are also enjoying a good euro/dollar exchange rate.
Instead I am convinced that it is caused by speculation by the distribution sector, especially the major retailers, otherwise how do you explain that in Italy, prices for agricultural produce have changed little in the last seven years and certainly not to the extent by which consumer prices have increased?
In Italy, either the multinational major retailers or the cooperatives are using a cartel strategy utterly speculatively to the detriment of consumers.
Purchasing power will only recover, I believe, with a moratorium on consumer prices.
I agree: less market, less competition and less globalisation to help productivity and consumption.
I will therefore be voting against the Council and Commission statement.
<D>
(HU) Thank you very much, Mr President.
Nine months on from the ceremonious handover of the Fundamental Rights Agency, it is no joy for me to speak about the fact that the institution has not been able to start work, and still has no management.
At least this week the multiannual framework programme will be adopted by Parliament, for which I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Cashman.
The multiannual framework programme is crucial for the Agency's work and for how effective it will be in monitoring fundamental rights and formulating what to do.
The trilateral agreement process for creating the founding charter left open some routes down which it is our duty to continue.
For example, the statement by the Council wanted to use political strength to achieve the possibility for the Agency to investigate the enforcement of human rights in the area of cooperation with the police and judiciary at the Agency's request.
It is important for Member States and the Union to avail themselves of the opportunities they have until this is incontrovertibly the duty of the Agency, after the entry into force of the Reform Treaty.
Likewise, it is our joint responsibility that the individual and community rights of national and ethnic minorities are rendered unquestionable, not only by prohibiting discrimination but also through the requirement for positive law enforcement.
In principle, the recognition of social rights as human rights cannot be questioned either, since there is no human dignity without basic security.
It is a cliché, but true nonetheless, that every decision is worth however much of it is implemented.
Mr Vice-President Frattini's words have cast a little doubt, but nonetheless I hope that the Agency will be consistent in protecting human rights.
<D>
(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the fact that we are able to adopt the goods package at first reading speaks volumes for the excellent cooperation that has taken place within the European Parliament as well as between Parliament and the Council.
This is an important legislative project, both for those involved in trade and, more especially, for consumers.
Through this package we are removing obstacles to trade that have resulted from differing technical rules in the Member States.
At the same time we are guaranteeing the quality of the products that are traded on the European market.
The new legislation will ensure that products which do not comply with EU law or which are unsafe are quickly removed from the market or do not reach the market in the first place.
Dangerous products are to be reported to the Commission without delay so that they can be taken out of circulation in all member countries.
Cooperation with countries outside the EU - one need only think of China - will be improved under the Regulation by measures such as joint programmes and exchanges of technical expertise.
Through these new provisions, we are ensuring efficient market surveillance and better scrutiny throughout Europe.
That, after all, is what really counts.
In all our discussions and negotiations we focused primarily on the consumer.
The CE mark, for example, signifies the manufacturer's compliance with European requirements for the product in question.
Now, however, importers are to bear a greater share of responsibility alongside manufacturers.
In particular, false or misleading CE marks are prohibited, and those who use them will face criminal prosecution in the Member States.
All of this protects consumers, but it also safeguards honest entrepreneurs who observe all the rules.
One of our main successes has been the preservation of the tried and tested national safety marks such as the German 'GS' symbol.
Consumers are familiar with these marks and trust them.
On Thursday we shall adopt a set of rules that promotes trade in goods in the internal market to best effect while at the same time - and this is so important - protecting consumers by means of better surveillance.
<D>
The next item is a statement by the Council on the presentation of the Czech Presidency's programme.
I should like to welcome most warmly the President of the Council, the Prime Minister of the Czech Republic, Mirek Topolánek, to the European Parliament.
A very warm welcome to you, Mr Topolánek.
(Applause)
I should also like to welcome most warmly the President of the European Commission, José Manuel Durão Barroso.
Ladies and gentlemen, we all know that holding the Presidency is particularly challenging, and I know that Prime Minister Topolánek finds it not only intellectually but also emotionally very touching, with his political experience in the years of communism, to now be delivering his report for the European Union as its representative.
This is the second Presidency, the first being Slovenia, to hail from a country that joined the European Union on 1 May 2004.
I am sure that I speak for all of you, ladies and gentlemen, when I say that the Czech Presidency has our full support and that we intend to do our utmost to ensure it is a successful Presidency for the European Union at this difficult time.
On this basis, President-in-Office of the Council, Prime Minister Topolánek, I should like to invite you to address this House.
Once again, a very warm welcome to the European Parliament.
(Applause)
<D>
I voted in favour of this report.
Brazil was the last BRIC country to engage in a summit with the EU, which took place in July 2007 during the Portuguese Presidency.
It was therefore a natural reflection of the relations that Portugal has always maintained with Brazil.
As was said in this House in September 2007, Brazil is a country whose 200 million inhabitants speak one of the most common European languages in the world, Portuguese, and whose historical, civilising and cultural traditions have a close relationship with European traditions.
This is proven by the various political agreements throughout history to the present day.
This relationship will help to build other bridges with Latin America.
Given Brazil's recognised potential and its current economic and political performance at regional and global level, this Strategic Partnership must not be regarded as a future hindrance to other partnerships with Mercosur.
It should in fact be acclaimed as an example, in which the EU has obtained the necessary consensus on the common commercial and political interests.
It should be noted that both sides regard multilateral action as essential, based on the United Nations system and within the framework of the World Trade Organization.
Finally, I must say that I am somewhat curious about the future scope to be given to the cooperation protocols on education and culture.
<D>
(RO) I urge the European Union's 2011 budget to provide a better reflection of, and support for, youth policy.
Young people must be supported both at EU and national level.
In this regard, one of the projects which the Romanian Government is using to support young people is the construction of 100 000 homes for them in the next three years.
At the same time, I welcome the European Commission's target of awarding 3 million Erasmus grants to students by 2012.
However, it is also vitally important to increase the funding for Erasmus Mundus grants.
This will allow even more students and researchers from third countries - and in this case, I am thinking specifically of the Republic of Moldova as well - to study in the European Union.
As a young MEP, I support the Erasmus initiative, which is the first workplace providing young people with access to the labour market.
Finally, I would like to thank the European Commission for its promptness in approving the funding for the four energy projects which Romania is also involved in.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, in the old Rhodesia there used to be a tourism poster urging people to 'Come to Rhodesia and see the ruins of Zimbabwe'.
In later years, the slogan was turned around to make a double-edged joke: 'Come to Zimbabwe and see the ruins of Rhodesia'.
Today the poster might well read: 'Come to Zimbabwe and see the ruins of Zimbabwe' - referring not to the famous stonework, but to ruined hopes of prosperity and democracy.
I believe the European Union has a duty to use the current situation - in which, despite manipulation of various kinds, the Zimbabwean Opposition's courage has, after all, won it a major victory - to advance democracy and the rule of law in this important African state.
The people there have suffered enough.
We must, however, find ways of supporting them that are not liable to be interpreted as neo-colonialism.
So it is important that what we do should also have the backing of neighbouring countries and of the Zimbabwean people themselves.
That is why I welcome the first positive steps on the part of the African National Congress - although it needs to do more!
That is why I particularly welcome the brave example set by the dockworkers.
We need to state very clearly that it is the shared task of the European Union, the African Union and the various powers of southern Africa to ensure that the opportunity now created, following the elections, is properly used.
Mr Mugabe already has his place in history; each day that passes merely makes it a less impressive one.
<D>
(SK) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me a brief summary in the area of 'other sections'.
The European Parliament's work on the budget has resulted in major achievements and I will mention just a few.
Firstly, we reached a compromise on the overall size of the budget.
Secondly, as regards providing EU citizens with information about the work of the European Parliament and its results, we now have the tools for better cooperation and communication with citizens.
It must be stressed, however, that making progress in improving Parliament's information and communication strategy, would not in itself be sufficient.
If it is to be effective, the strategy requires the involvement of the Commission and of the European offices in the individual countries.
It must be coordinated and its results evaluated on a regular basis.
In that way we can achieve not only better access to information but also more transparency and a better use of resources.
Thirdly, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for supporting our efforts in building our knowledge management system.
It will help you in your future legislative work.
Fourthly, we have achieved more flexibility for groups of visitors.
Fifthly, I believe that the measures taken to support language services will result both in higher quality services and a better use of resources.
Finally, we reached agreement on several points concerning the environment and access to employment for the disabled.
What is important for the budget for 'other sections' is to assess each institution individually.
I would like to mention the Court of Auditors as an example of good practice in terms of drawing up a budget.
Savings were made in some budget lines by working out the budget on the basis of real expenditure rather than index-linked calculations.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank our rapporteurs as well as all the teams from the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament.
Our meetings, debates and conciliation procedures have all left me feeling very satisfied.
When you feel that all those involved want to reach an agreement, it makes for a positive environment, which can only lead to good results.
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, I would like to welcome this proposal and also to thank Richard Corbett for his hard, and not always rewarding, work.
Very often when we change the Rules of Procedure our colleagues get worried about what is happening.
Most of them only realise what has happened and what changes we have made once it has come into effect, by which time it can no longer be changed.
I firmly support most of the proposals which have been tabled, especially because they reflect not just your hard work, but also - as you mentioned - that of the parliamentary reform group chaired by Dagmar Roth-Behrendt, which prepared this proposal very well.
However, during the parliamentary reform process, I also made it clear for our group when we had our discussions that this report on parliamentary reform has to be approved by changes to the Rules of Procedure.
This is a democratic procedure ending in a vote.
Nothing could be changed just by discussions in that group and we worked very much along these lines.
I would also like to mention that I was somewhat critical about what has just been mentioned, namely that some of the informal procedures which we have in the Parliament are institutionalised.
I am somewhat afraid because if we have a custom, then it is better to keep it as a custom and not necessarily change the rules.
For our group, the most important point is, however, proportionality.
In our Parliament, the committees have very strong roles.
In preparing the votes here in Parliament they take a lot of the burden from this House by voting in committee.
It is not just a simple question of procedure, but a question of democracy, that the committees reflect the proportions which exist in plenary when important issues are decided.
I think this is a basic question of democracy and, on behalf of the PPE-DE, support the report.
<D>
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, most of us recognise the benefits of migration.
The Member States which have opened their borders to migrants from other Member States have not seen a rise in unemployment; rather, they have seen a growth in productivity, a rise in economic growth and the creation of new jobs.
It is the old, old story.
The incomers do jobs that the natives do not want to do, they work hard, they cost little and they bring new ideas.
But it is important to recognise that some people cross borders not wishing to work - or at least not wishing to work legally.
European Union law recognises this, as you have laid out, Commissioner.
While giving the right to reside in other Member States, it allows the host state to limit the right of residence to three months if there is no means of subsistence and to terminate that right if there is a threat to public order.
One of the great successes of our Union has been this right to move freely, now enjoyed by millions of citizens in their studies, in their working lives, in retirement.
It is not without its challenges and, just as the Jews, a people lacking a homeland, were often unwelcome in ages past, so today the Roma, some nine million people, are discriminated against in many host countries.
Yet to equate the Roma people with the country of Romania, even if many of them are Romanian citizens, is to misunderstand the nature of both.
You might as well equate them with the city of Roma.
European Union funds have been made available for the integration of the Roma.
We are working with George Soros and his Decade of Roma Inclusion.
But we need all Member States to sign up to that and a common Community framework strategy for Roma inclusion if this is to work.
It is a pity that Italy did not draw down any of these funds.
Spain drew down some EUR 52 million and Poland some EUR 8 million.
But it is not only a lack of foresight on the part of the Italian Government; it is also matched by a lack of foresight on the part of the Commission.
I think Mr Barroso was wrong when he said in his interview in La Repubblica yesterday that it is inconceivable that European Union authorities should promote integration on the ground.
It should not be inconceivable.
I share, Mr Frattini, the views of Mr Schulz.
You should not be playing party politics in this matter.
This House demands that you concentrate on your current responsibilities, not on your possible future career.
Italians know as well as others the vulnerability of migrant communities.
In 1893, at Aigues-Mortes in France, Italian salt workers in the Peccais were lynched in xenophobic attacks about the protection of local jobs.
But one of the great achievements of the Union is that such pogroms are a piece of the past.
Too often, nonetheless, democracies are run by crisis management.
It is, perhaps, more evident in Italy than elsewhere.
But if there are problems in Italy, there will be problems in other countries too.
If the right of residence abroad is an EU right, we cannot allow Member States to rewrite the exceptional provisions, as the Italian Government has done in its decree.
There is nothing to stop a country giving powers to prefects to deal with it as long as there is a right of appeal.
An appeal to a justice of the peace who is not a legal expert is insufficient, just as is the use only of Italian or English in legal documents.
But I trust the Italian Parliament will correct these provisions and ensure consistency of the national legislation with EU provisions.
For us, this is the first real case of the European Parliament overseeing the application of justice and home affairs legislation, together with national parliaments.
We need to look not only at what does not work, but at what does work, and we need your active commitment, Commissioner, in that task.
(Applause from the centre and left)
<D>
(RO) I would like to use this opportunity to speak in the European Parliament plenum about the history of the NATO Summit hosted by Bucharest, the capital of Romania, on 2 - 4 April.
We all know the importance of NATO, both for the security of the Euro-Atlantic area and for the democratization and welfare of the newly-integrated countries.
This happened to Romania in 2004 and we hope the same will happen to Croatia and Albania, the countries invited to join NATO in Bucharest.
I am convinced that the crisis regarding the name of Macedonia will also be solved by the dialogue with Greece, so that another reliable partner of the European Union, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, would be invited to join NATO.
We also know that accession to NATO is an important step for integration into the European Union.
As a member of the ALDE Group in the European Parliament, I welcome NATO's openness to Ukraine and Georgia, as a decisive signal for including these countries on the European path.
I am confident that we, the European Union, in general, and the European Parliament in particular, will also have the openness to encourage Ukraine and Georgia to undertake the correct path, the European path.
<D>
Madam President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I welcome the delegation of the well-known politicians Alexander Milinkevich and Alexander Kozulin, who are following our debate here in the European Parliament today and will then be able to report back to their own country on it.
It is still a problem that information on our work here for the country of Belarus has to take this route because there are no other options.
This is a sign that the basic preconditions for democratic development in Belarus have still not been established.
Freedom of opinion and freedom of information are essential for democracy.
This summer, President Yushchenko made a public promise to conduct the elections in his country openly, democratically and fairly, and he broke that promise.
An election campaign that denies the opposition any possibility of presenting its candidates throughout the country and changes the conditions so fundamentally that even a well-organised opposition is not able to get even one candidate elected is not a fair, democratic election.
Therefore, our resolution is clear on this point.
We need to include the prerequisite of having the visa ban lifted and at this point, the prerequisite of a new financial instrument to be equipped with funds to support the opposition and the people in their efforts to establish democracy.
<D>
Whether the Treaties are revised by way of an Intergovernmental Conference or by way of a Convention changes absolutely nothing as far as the crux of the problem is concerned.
Whether through incompetence, negligence or political miscalculation, one single country, France, refused to anticipate the consequences of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon for its representation in the European Parliament, in spite of the repeated demands of several political groups, including my own.
Consequently, today, France is the only one of the 27 that intends to appoint two new MEPs by the indirect means of a decision by a national parliament of which the voting system is thoroughly unjust.
All of this is in violation of the Treaties themselves, and in violation of the Act of 1976, which provides for the election of MEPs by direct universal suffrage.
Moreover, complicit in this is the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, which, despite having been dealt a severe blow in the 2009 elections, will inherit one of the two extra seats.
This is scheming between friends, with the support of this Parliament.
Unfortunately, in order to pass off this anomaly, the rapporteur is hiding behind the temporary nature of the measure.
Temporary?
The new French MEPs will sit for four years, which is more than 80% of the parliamentary term.
I would have expected our fellow Member to have been firmer in terms of both the value of words and the defence of democratic principles.
<D>
The fact that Agustin Díaz de Mera's report was adopted by a large majority highlights the benefit of the decision to remove visa requirements for Taiwan.
The European Parliament is therefore confirming the confidence it has in the major process of democratisation which has been undertaken in recent years.
I would like to emphasise the remarkable economic progress which has been made by Taiwan.
Taiwan conducts a significant volume of trade with the EU and its economy is number 25 in the world, continuing to grow by more than 13% annually.
This sustained development reduces the chances of the EU facing an influx of illegal migrants from Taiwan.
This is why I believe that facilitating the movement of persons must become one of the key features of bilateral cooperation.
The decision to waive the compulsory visa requirement for Taiwanese nationals also takes into account their fulfilment of the technical conditions on travel document security.
The introduction of biometric passports in 2008 is one of the constructive measures implemented so far.
I hope that the European Parliament's decision will be approved by the Council and that the new provision will even enter into force this year.
Finally, I think that the decision made by the Taiwanese authorities to lift the visa requirement for citizens from Romania, Bulgaria and Cyprus is appropriate, given the need to respect the criteria of reciprocity.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, yes, a crisis has hit the poorest countries the hardest and there is in fact not much that we can do about it.
We can only talk about the remedies to get them back on track, and obviously this will take more time than it will take in the developed world because the mechanisms to produce new economic growth are much less developed in those countries.
One of the remarks that have been made by several members is about the fact that a lot of Member States are in fact backtracking on their Official Development Assistance (ODA) engagements.
The EU Member States agreed in 2005 individual minimum aid targets of 0.51% for EU-15 and 0.17% for EU-12, for the new Member States to be reached by 2010 and respectively 0.7% and 0.33% by 2015.
The countries that had already achieved aid levels higher than these targets promised to maintain.
Based on these confirmations and higher national pledges of some Member States, the EU should collectively reach 0.56% of ODA by 2010.
I believe that the crisis should not be an excuse to water down donors' aid promises, and I will insist on remaining committed to delivering the promised aid levels, both for EU Member States as well as other donors.
In 2008, the EU ODA has increased by around EUR 4 billion to a level of 0.40% of ODA and the collective EU ODA is forecast to continue increasing.
On the basis of the information gathered from Member States, we foresee the EU collective ODA increasing to EUR 53.4 billion in 2009, which represents 0.44%, and EUR 58.7 billion, representing 0.48%, in 2010.
This also means that, without additional steps by Member States to fulfil their individual targets, the collective targets for 2010 will not be achieved.
The forecasted trend of a continuing increase in EU ODA relies on those Member States that are trying to respect their commitments, but efforts are required by all Member States, and I will continue to insist on that with the respective Member Sates.
It is their responsibility.
This is an engagement that they have taken up, and the crisis should not be an excuse to water down their engagements.
I would even say, to the contrary.
Several Members have also insisted on the reform of the international financial institutions.
This is a target that I can fully subscribe to.
The G20 has set out a precise timetable for governance reforms of the Bretton Woods institutions urging them to accelerate the implementation of their own plans for reform which predate the London Summit.
Some deliverables are expected as early as April next year and I am confident that solutions can be found on outstanding issues.
Given the current momentum in IMF reform created by the G20, the Commission underlines the importance of advancing the second phase of reform at the World Bank with a view to concluding it by spring 2010.
The London Summit of 2 April 2009 will go down in the history of the G20 as one where development issues were handled in their own right and in the presence of developing countries' representatives.
In preparation for the next G20, these last months have seen intense activity by the institution tasked with following up.
In August, the IMF Board of Governors approved a USD 250 billion general allocation of IMF special drawing rights, of which USD 18 billion will go to low income countries, and the IMF will be called to account in Pittsburgh on other measures for low income countries.
So this is, I think, a positive evolution.
Louis Michel, my predecessor, has also insisted on the flexibility, claiming that the budgetary support mechanism is the most flexible we have, and this is obviously true but, of course, this also means that we need a counterpart with the developing countries and we need to be in a position to have political dialogue with them and also monitoring mechanisms, so it presupposes a minimum cooperation on their behalf, but, once that is in place, I also believe that, especially, sectoral budgetary support is a very adequate procedure.
I do not quite understand why this resolution that has been introduced by the Committee on Development and refers to the G20 meeting of Pittsburgh is not being voted on before the G20 meeting.
I do not grasp that.
There will probably be one or another technical explanation for that but I think it gives the wrong signal from this newly elected Parliament that we are going to debate such a resolution after the G20 meeting in Pittsburgh, which is due to happen, if I remember correctly, from 22 to 24 September, before our next meeting in Strasbourg in October.
This is not within my discretion but I must say that, together with Members who have advocated this, I very much deplore that we have not been able to vote upon this resolution during this part-session.
<D>
(FR) Mr Jouyet, when Nicole Fontaine was putting her question, the Council was already answering.
That is rare enough to be worthy of note.
In fact, 48 hours ago, the Competitiveness Council examined and supported the plan put forward by the Commission in July, while our Parliament is still considering it.
That is an undeniable success for the Council under the French Presidency and I would like to thank you, Mr Jouyet, and pay tribute to the good work that you and your colleagues have done, in particular Mr Novelli.
The Council's success is particularly notable because the Commission's plan meant that you had to add an action plan, taking the principles it contained and setting goals for the next 3, 5 and 10 years.
I understand that, in practical terms, what we have to do now is to consider small and medium-sized enterprises first in every piece of legislation and in every measure.
We will do this with the European private company, with the late payments directive, with, I hope, cuts in VAT rates, and so on.
I would simply like to say, however, to conclude, that above all SMEs must not be ghettoised, in other words the SME regulations we introduce must not be so singular that they end up forming a handicap.
I agree with what Mrs Vlasto just said.
It is obvious that in the current situation, when these businesses are in such need of funding and obtaining finance is so difficult, we must not take measures on their behalf, for example accounting guarantee exemptions, that cut their credits and therefore prevent them from having the means to operate.
It is for this reason that small and medium-sized enterprises are not sub-companies.
They must be companies like any others, vital to the European economy.
<D>
Mr President, some of the best questions are raised late in the evening and this is one of them, although there is an element of 'the dialogue of the deaf' because we do not have the Council here to hear this debate.
There are two words which we talk about a great deal in Europe: one is 'subsidiarity' and the other, 'solidarity'.
Subsidiarity is about respecting the Member States and their rights and solidarity, in my view, reflects the commonality of the European Union and our support for each other.
So, why does this fund not work to do that?
Indeed, one of the dangers and the damage as a result of its failure to work is that we make announcements about funding being available and then fail to deliver because the system is complex, bureaucratic and very unwieldy for communities and for individuals to work with.
It is, I presume, about budget and about money, ultimately.
I listened very carefully to the comments of the Commissioner responsible for Financial Programming and Budget last week about many things, from the common agricultural policy to other issues but, in particular, calling for a more flexible budget, a budget to react swiftly to world events rather than the European Union running after events.
I am sorry that she did not speak about the need for flexibility to react to events in the European Union because I think that is what we are talking about here this evening.
I come from a country which has said 'no' to the Lisbon Treaty, where we talk increasingly about trying to bring citizens closer to the European Union, and the best way to do that is to see Europe in action rather than in words.
I am afraid that there are too many announcements about things in the European Union and too little action on the ground where people see it working.
On a positive note there was a survey this morning in the papers which suggests that the Irish public are looking perhaps at changing their minds on Lisbon.
So I would hate you to leave the Chamber despondent.
<D>
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, with his proposals for a Mediterranean Union, President Sarkozy recognised what many knew yet would not admit: that the Barcelona Process - top-down and driven by European interests - was dead in the water, leading our southern partners to opt out and a widening prosperity gap to emerge on either side of the Mediterranean.
If Europe is serious about reversing the failures of the last decade and generating development and security on its southern shores we must now learn to give as well as take.
We must build on the ashes of the Barcelona Process - a true partnership based on trust, reciprocity and, above all, mutual respect.
The Mediterranean must not be a cultural dividing line but a meeting place.
Joint investment in infrastructure - such as ports, sea links and energy grids - will bring our peoples together far more effectively than the high-sounding declarations which characterised the Barcelona Process.
We need investment in people too.
The kind of energy which brought together the French and Germans after the last big war must be invested in bringing Europeans and North Africans together to prevent the next.
The worst possible mistake the French Presidency could make is to commit the European Union - and by extension its citizens - to a grandiose project without providing finance for such cooperation for a number of years down the line.
And, as Mr Schulz said, creating a full-blown bureaucratic structure alongside the standing delegations and the External Action Service need not be the way; a focus on values must be.
Despite the worsening situation, particularly in Egypt and Israel, and the fact that we claim such values as the basis of EU foreign policy, references to human rights are mysteriously hard to find in the Commission's proposals.
I hope this is something the Commission will look at.
But, these objections aside, Liberals and Democrats are pleased to show support for this Union for the Mediterranean, with one important caveat: pragmatic cooperation on economic issues must not be a substitute for promoting peace in the Middle East through the common foreign and security policy envisaged in the Lisbon Treaty.
Since the Commissioner recognises the link between economic development and peace, what would be a better sign of peace and goodwill towards our Arab neighbours than abolishing agricultural tariffs?
Our much-vaunted free trade agreements have failed to boost living standards because they excluded agriculture and services, which account for two thirds of the GDP in the Middle East and North Africa.
If we do not take the produce of these countries, we will end up taking their people.
Reforming the CAP, providing a level playing field for goods from the Southern Mediterranean, would go a long way towards tackling the causes of record migration into Europe.
As the inimitable Doctor Johnson once said 'Life cannot subsist ... but by reciprocal concessions'.
And, for the sake of the success of this Union, Europe must make the first move.
<D>
(RO) I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on his work.
Energy and climate change are priorities of the European Union.
That is why energy statistics enabling the Union to assess this sector and to take the necessary actions are extremely important.
On 26 February 2008, Eurostat published a set of statistical indicators for energy, transport and the environment.
In the case of energy we find indicators for energy reliance, energy intensity, energy sources, final energy consumption, renewable energy, energy efficiency and energy prices.
As regards climate change, we find information about greenhouse gas emissions.
The Member States will have the obligation to provide the necessary data to obtain the indicators requested by the proposed Regulation.
Important funds will be needed for data collection and processing.
Amendment 14 also refers to time savings due to the use of information technology in data collection and processing.
Amendment 5 outlines the necessity of security in the supply of the most important fuels and the availability of exact data at European level, supplied in due time, in order to anticipate and coordinate the solutions at European Union level in case of possible supply shortages.
This is in line with the solidarity clause for cases of energy shortages under the Treaty of Lisbon.
European citizens need such correct and exact statistics.
<D>
With its new package of proposals on electronic communications, the EU is promoting measures to police and intimidate users of the Internet and all electronic communications, by introducing 'filtering' systems on the pretext of public safety and protection of rights.
At the same time, it is uniformly placing the internal EU market for telecommunications, the Internet, audiovisual production and transmission, radio and television media and satellite connections under the control of a strengthened 'independent' authority for the benefit of the monopoly companies.
Profits are being secured and the position of the European monopolies vis-à-vis international competition is being strengthened by liberalising and unifying the markets at European level.
First there will be complete liberalisation and privatisation at national level, and then radical restructuring, over-concentrating of the media and an accumulation of capital at the expense of workers in the sector and of users.
There are two separate infrastructures: on the one hand, there are public services funded by the government; on the other, we have free market trade.
The government funds public services with money from the state, and as this is unprofitable, the services are sold off to private operators.
The acceptance of these proposals by centre-right and centre-left forces once again reveals their enthusiastic support for the choices made in the interest of capital.
This confirms the need to change the balance of power in favour of the workers with a radically different policy to make use of new technology for the benefit of the workers.
<D>
in writing. - The situation in the Gaza Strip is deplorable.
Hundreds of innocent civilians have been killed and thousands presently face death on a daily basis.
Yes, I accept Israel should be allowed to live in peace.
Yes, rocket attacks across the border are unacceptable and should stop.
But the response by Israel is totally disproportionate and cannot be supported.
The Israelis have failed to respect the international community.
They have shelled the UN compound, they have attacked schools and children.
This is totally unacceptable and must stop.
We must have a cease-fire immediately.
I will vote in favour of this resolution because the European Parliament needs to have its voice heard so that innocent Palestinians trapped in Gaza will not be forgotten.
Israel: you have the right to live in peace.
You do not have the right to practise wanton destruction and to be the delivery body of death and destruction on innocent civilians.
Your actions mean that you have become the aggressor, not the victim.
<D>
in writing. - (FR) 'Flexicurity' is a smokescreen masking the commoditisation of work and of workers.
This smokescreen appears to have come from Denmark.
After the Swedish model of the 1960s, the Yugoslav model of self-management of the 1970s, the everlasting Mao model, the ex-Soviet model, the Blairist and even the Zappatist model, we now have the Danish model.
It is 'Andersen-mania', Margaret Thatcher disguised as the little mermaid to make us think that if we give 'disposable workers' a few allowances, some training and rapid re-integration we are making them more secure.
Denmark has more strike days than France, but never mind that.
Flexicurity has made it a paradise of flexible labour markets and happy workers (though you have to wonder why they still go on strike...).
What is the truth in all this?
The truth is that we are trying to create 'Mindongs' in Europe, like the Chinese 'half-farmers, half-labourers' working under the worst possible conditions.
The whole idea is to reduce the level of protection offered by the Social Security Code and the Labour Code.
'Flexicurity' is phariseeism applied to labour law.
The economic result - as with the reduction in social security contributions, which has failed to end the imbalance in production costs between Asia and Europe - will be illusory.
<D>
President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, I should like to thank you for all your contributions.
As I said in my introductory remarks, in the last months we have seen steps made by the Belarus authorities that go towards the expectations formulated in the October 2008 Council conclusions.
These steps are significant in the Belarus context.
At the same time, the picture is mixed, and I think the debate here confirmed that.
We would like see further steps, such as the changes to the criminal court, registration of other media outlets and NGOs in Belarus.
During the future review of the restrictive measures, the situation in Belarus and steps made by the Government will be taken into account.
The progress in areas listed in the October 2008 Council's conclusions will be evaluated; we are already doing this on a permanent basis, and also discussing progress with the members of the opposition - for example, I met Alexander Kazulin in Prague just a week ago.
Subject to progress made towards democracy, human rights and the rule of law, we remain ready to deepen our relations with Belarus.
I believe that we can offer Belarus concrete incentives within the Eastern Partnership, but not only.
Now let me turn to the lively debate here on the Eastern Partnership launching summit and in particular the level of participation of Belarus.
Listen carefully: no decision has yet been taken on this issue, which requires consensus within the EU.
It will be addressed closer to the summit and I do not want to speculate at this stage.
But the pressure itself is simply the fact that no invitation has yet been issued.
I should like to thank you once again for this interesting debate and your valuable input.
We very much appreciate the interest and active involvement of the European Parliament on Belarus.
We are also encouraged by your support for the EU's policy of engagement.
Belarus is an important neighbour of the EU and, therefore, developments there are of concern to all of us.
It is important that we send a clear and consistent message to Minsk and I am pleased that Parliament has been able to support us on this.
Engagement is important since it offers us the best way of securing the sort of changes which we wish to see in Belarus and which are important to the EU's wider interests.
As I said in my opening remarks, I stand ready to keep this Parliament informed of developments, and I am sure that also goes for the future presidencies, not least in relation to the future in-depth review agreed by the Council last week.
<D>
Madam President, I will also support the compromise but I am not at all sure that we are doing the right thing because the issue at hand is not whether we kill seals or whether the seals are in danger of not surviving: these issues have been cleared up.
The issue is whether they are killed humanely or not.
And of course in our daily existence we know there are hundreds of thousands of animals that we are happy to have killed, either to eat them or to use their products in other ways.
We are happy to have fish dying after hours of suffering on hooks and in nets and we do not complain about that.
So why are we complaining about the seals?
Well, because they are beautiful animals and because watching their blood being spilt on white ice is not very nice.
So are we voting and are we deciding with our hearts rather than with our brains and our heads on this?
I just wonder.
<D>
(ES) Mr President, next weekend the Council of Agriculture Ministers will likely take the political decision on this reform of the COM in wine.
Wine is not just a foodstuff, it is also an economic gem in the agriculture sector, which has been severely penalised by Commission decisions in recent years.
We are on time, for the first time in a long while: Parliament is going to draw up a report that can be used by the Council to determine its ultimate political decision this weekend.
I must say I am genuinely satisfied with this, and wish to congratulate the rapporteur on his work, since for the first time the EP has resolved to focus on quality, culture, tradition, a Mediterranean product that has also been taken to other parts of Europe, a product which enhances our stature not only on our own continent, but around the world.
Our wine - and let there be no doubt about this, ladies and gentlemen - is the best in the world; Europe's wine is the best in the world.
That is why we have to protect it and focus on promoting it: promoting it not only outside the EU, but here, too, because young people in Europe have stopped drinking wine in recent years.
Why have they stopped drinking wine?
Because we have not bothered to promote it or to encourage them to drink it.
We must supply the tools of competitiveness to the wine sector to keep it competitive within and outside the European Union.
We must promote wine consumption and involve young people and European society as a whole in a culture, the culture of wine tourism, the culture of wine consumption, the culture of wine know-how and the culture of discussion and participation within society.
Ladies and gentlemen, there is a shortage of funds for rural development because a political decision taken in December 2005 did not provide enough money for the second pillar.
However, funding must not be secured to the detriment of the COMs, but by encouraging the Member States to allocate slightly more of their national budgets to the Community budget.
It is not by taking money away from the farmers that we will fill a gap as huge as rural development in the European budget under this financial perspective.
With regard to planting rights, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that tools must be given to the sector to allow it to regulate itself.
These tools must be legal tools and they must be issued here so as to continue to protect planting rights, which enable production to be controlled.
There are already indications that it may be profitable to control such production, just as the designations of origin are strictly controls.
Commitments must be upheld, and therefore we will vote against all the amendments tabled, especially any amendments that do not respect the commitments already made, and here I am referring to the Socialist Group.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - The picture in the European Union is quite uneven.
The overall statistics - the averages - are very bad; they are really alarming.
However, the point is that some countries have relatively good performances, successfully fighting youth unemployment even in the recession.
This is particularly the case in the Netherlands and Austria, and to some extent also in Germany.
Countries with weaker performances can learn from these experiences.
The successful model has several components, and there are also several reasons for failure in countries where youth unemployment has risen to one third of the age group.
There are quite a few - more than half a dozen -countries in the second group at this moment.
The link between education and the labour market is absolutely key to improving the performance of the education system - vocational training and further training opportunities are particularly important - so we advocate reforms which point in that direction.
There is clearly a role to play for better employment contracts, which is why, in the flagship initiative Agenda for New Skills and Jobs and subsequent documents, we highlighted the problem of segmentation and advocated the use of open-ended contracts, which may have a wider relevance but which help the younger generation in particular.
We have also advocated youth guarantees, which have been successfully applied in some Member States; wider use of these is very promising.
I would also like to highlight the youth-specific ESF programmes.
I have seen quite a few of them.
I think that they are very important, especially where the risk of marginalisation, of being locked out of employment opportunities, is a great social risk.
I think that the European Social Fund can be used in an innovative way; there are many very good examples.
We are prepared to disseminate good projects which can provide employment and learning opportunities where young people live; but there are also many examples which provide opportunities to go and work in other countries.
I believe that, especially at this time, we also have to draw the attention of young people to the need for mobility and to foreign opportunities.
We need to help boost skills and spread information - the EURES network is very useful there and that is what the Commission directly supports - and also help mobility, because job opportunities and vacancies very often come up in different regions or different countries.
At a young age, this should not be seen as an obstacle.
Subject: The CAP and the multiannual financial framework beyond 2013
The need for an adequately-financed CAP, which delivers public goods, such as a secure and sustainable food supply for the EU, which ensures a stable food price regime both at the farm gate and on the shop shelves and which underpins a vibrant rural economy, is as important now as ever, especially in the light of the recent rise in energy prices and instability in certain regions of the globe.
Can the Commission confirm that an adequately-financed CAP, maintaining the current share of the EU budget, will be a central part of any reform to the multiannual financial framework, in the light of the central role that the common agricultural policy plays in continuing to deliver such public goods?
Subject: The funding of the CAP post 2013
Can the Commission confirm its support for a strong and well resourced common agricultural policy under the next multiannual financial framework?
<D>
Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, animal- and public-health rules applying to the export of poultry meat from China ensure an equivalent level of protection to those of the EU.
These import rules guarantee that all imported products fulfil the same high standards as products from the EU Member States, not only with respect to hygiene and all aspects of consumer safety but also regarding animal health status.
The principle according to which food must be safe, irrespective of its origin, is at the core of the EU approach.
The official control system in China was verified on the spot by three Commission inspections.
The outcome was published on the website of DG SANCO.
The inspections have shown that the competent authorities, in particular in Shandong Province, are sufficiently well structured to guarantee compliance with Community legislation as regards heat-treated poultry meat products.
Furthermore, these inspection missions have also verified that the competent authorities are capable of enforcing the Community's import requirements.
As a result of this exercise, the Chinese authorities have demonstrated to the Commission services that they can certify that consignments of heat-treated poultry meat products being exported to the European Union were produced in accordance with Community requirements and come only from Shandong Province.
All approved plants in the Community list of establishments from which imports of heat-treated poultry meat is authorised are located in Shandong Province.
This was verified by the three fact-finding missions on the spot: one in 2004; two in 2006.
According to the WTO agreement on sanitary and phytosanitary measures, any third country may request authorisation for export for the totality or part of its territory to the Commission, which is considered and evaluated according to the relevant Community requirements.
If the guarantees given by a third country are deemed satisfactory and are effectively verified, such requests from third countries are accepted and authorisation for export granted.
Any risk of distortion of competition towards EU poultry producers is prevented by the fact that the measures in place provide for sufficient guarantees that the heat-treated poultry meat products from certain regions are compliant with the level of protection that the EU deems necessary.
Informed choice by consumers would be the answer to competitive pressure.
The Chinese authorities expressed interest in the approval by the Commission of the imports of heat-treated poultry meat from Jilin Province.
To get this approval, the Chinese authorities will have to guarantee that the sanitary conditions applied to the production of heat-treated poultry meat in Jilin Province meets EC requirements, and the Commission will verify these guarantees by on-the-spot inspections.
<D>
Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Parish on bringing this forward.
Despite our political differences, and notwithstanding his very obvious deficiencies as a human being, I think he is actually very sound on this and I support him.
We need this regulation to be a success and we need it to be universally in force, but I have a number of reservations and I disagree with some colleagues who spoke this morning.
Mr Stevenson said that longer journeys were unavoidable - I say: not so.
Mrs Jensen spoke of 24-hours transport - not necessarily.
Mr Allister, the agricultural industry has to ask questions itself.
As a civilised society, we need to look at the whole question, the whole purpose, the whole idea of transporting animals long distances and then killing them.
If I were a meat eater, I would be asking how can the suffering en route which we know about, the dehydration, the stress and - to our Irish colleagues North and South - the sea journeys, possibly improve the quality of the product at the end?
To my mind, it makes no economic sense.
It does not make humanitarian sense.
This is why I favour a complete ban on the transport of animals, which, I believe, would support rural economies.
It would encourage local producers, yes, small- and medium-sized enterprises as someone spoke of, and it would enable consumption of food as near the point of production as possible.
In the absence of that, and I know it is not going to happen in the near future, I think we need proper realistic enforcement of what we have at the moment, the regulation, and I urge the Commission to use all the agencies across Europe - police forces on motorways if necessary - to stop and check lorries to see whether they are carrying out the full requirements of this legislation.
<D>
President-in-Office of the Council. - Madam President, we have had a very long but important debate here today.
This is a crucial year in the accession process for Croatia and for the whole of the Western Balkan region and we certainly attach importance to and welcome Parliament's continued support in bringing Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the Western Balkans closer to the EU.
Much has been said about the lack of progress in Turkey regarding its reform effort.
We therefore welcome the reaffirmed commitment of Turkey towards its EU path, as Mr Erdogan said, and invite her to take the opportunity in 2009 to prove this commitment and make further progress in its path towards the EU.
Turkey has to deliver on long-awaited reforms.
The continuing support of the European Parliament throughout the process is significant, in particular, given the challenges ahead.
I will have the opportunity of meeting the Turkish negotiator tomorrow in Prague.
At the same time, we should not take lightly the strategic importance of Turkey, in particular, in the current turbulent times, nor should we forget our previous commitments.
As far as I know, President Obama, during his visit to Europe, may visit Turkey as a kind of model Muslim country.
I think that this is not the time for Europeans to give up in our engagement with Turkey.
I think that Joost Lagendijk, rightly, said this.
Concerning the border dispute between Croatia and Slovenia, I was listening carefully to what Hannes Swoboda, István Szent-Iványi and many others said, so let me just repeat that we as the Presidency welcome the fact that both Slovenia and Croatia have now agreed to pursue their work on Commissioner Rehn's initiative concerning this dispute.
We fully support this initiative and we are concerned that it has not generated any fruitful outcome yet regarding the specific terms of facilitation.
We note that time is running out, and the Presidency is keen to ensure concrete progress in the negotiations based on the work already done.
We are therefore considering the possibilities for enhancing our support for the Commissioner's initiative in the near future.
We were just discussing this over lunch.
Concerning the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Bernd Posselt, among others, said that we should support the effort of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and I think he is right.
I shall just mention that the Czech Prime Minister Topolánek visited Skopje yesterday and reaffirmed our commitment to the European aspiration of this country.
<D>
rapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, the decision my report proposes to this Chamber is, above all, political, in the strictest sense of the word.
The formal decision we are about to adopt, though clearly relevant, is the very least of it.
Indeed, we are about to amend our Rules of Procedure to make official what is already a reality, what the different Union institutions have been doing for years.
I would like to remind Members of that.
We are proposing that this House should use the Union flag in all its meeting places and on the most formal occasions, for example, at constituent sittings or when receiving heads of state.
We also propose that the anthem should be played on these occasions, that the motto 'United in Diversity' should be included in all our written documents and that Europe Day should be celebrated.
Mr President, although you were in favour of the idea, we are not suggesting that the euro should be used as a symbol.
However, in our opinion, the euro is a great tool, a wonderful instrument that is undoubtedly helping us to deal with the international financial crisis.
Where would we be without the euro?
We would be back in this torturous situation of competitive devaluation that would have brought our real economy to its knees in the face of international financial speculation.
The most important aspect of my report is the political message to citizens.
This message is very clear: the symbols of the Union are alive and well in the institution that represents, more directly than any other, the 500 million inhabitants of our 27 Member States.
This means that the constitutional process that was launched in 2002 with the European Convention lives on in spite of frequent and sizeable obstacles and setbacks.
The Convention, of which I had the honour of being a member, along with other distinguished Members here today, had no doubts about including the symbols of the EU in the Union's primary law for the first time.
It thus happily brought to an end a curious situation whereby the most important body of law did not recognise what the public had long accepted: the symbols.
The decision in this respect was unanimous and no one challenged it during the ratification process; on the contrary, it was one of the provisions most welcomed by Europe's supporters.
I have to say that it came as a huge surprise, therefore, when the Intergovernmental Conference which adopted the Lisbon Treaty decided to remove all mention of European symbols from this document.
The fact is that, through our decision today, we can undo this error.
Of course, we are not amending primary law, but we can do our part and move a step closer to formalising Union symbols within the institutional framework.
Symbols express a shared goal and shared values.
In Europe's case, it is the desire to build a Union of and for all citizens who want unity, freedom, democracy, justice, equality and solidarity, which are European values that we also consider to be universal.
Symbols also allow us to establish what we are and who we want to be in relation to the rest of the world, which recognises us by them.
Who, for instance, has not felt proud to represent the Union when wearing the election observer's waistcoat?
Furthermore, symbols help us to remember where we came from, that day when our story of unity, growth and freedom began to be written.
What the President of Parliament said a few days ago in Madrid about young people and history has much to do with symbols.
We must remind young people where we came from, who we are and where we are going.
Symbols get this message across quickly and clearly.
These symbols unite, not divide, us.
This is not only a great virtue, but, more than anything, a huge advantage.
Mr President, the wonderful writer Aldous Huxley said that the most important thing is not experience, but what you do with that experience.
The same applies to symbols.
The flag is not intended to be an icon, but to be used in our everyday lives to strengthen the unity for which we are known.
<D>
In the resolution which has been adopted, the European Parliament has clearly declared its support for greater transparency in the European Commission's negotiations on the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement.
Piracy and counterfeiting are a growing problem for the European economy and for other economies throughout the world.
The economies of developing countries are increasingly becoming knowledge-based economies.
Therefore, we also need clear and effective principles for the protection of intellectual property rights which will not interfere with innovation and competition, will not place an unjustified burden on legally conducted trade and will protect our privacy and fundamental rights, such as freedom of speech.
This is why the resolution adopted today does not challenge the idea of making the agreement itself.
However, the negotiations being conducted by the European Commission are not open.
The European Parliament and European citizens are not being kept up-to-date about progress in the negotiations.
This absence of information is a cause for concern.
We want greater transparency from the European Commission.
We want to know, now, what obligations the European Commission's negotiators are accepting on behalf of 500 million European Union citizens.
<D>
Mr President, I would question why, if the Lisbon Treaty is such a good thing, it is so inaccessible.
Is it because Member States are turned from the theoretical masters of the EU into its servants?
Is it because it makes law, rather than a framework for law-making?
Is it because it offers no checks and balances to control future law-makers?
Is it because it consolidates power in a self-perpetuating bureaucracy?
Like the last Treaty, this one gives the EU a permanent right to seize more powers without any future agreements - an outrageous power grab.
Such undemocratic powers are illegal in the United Kingdom, because no British Parliament can bind its successors.
Mrs Wallström said the word 'constitution' was being dropped to avoid trouble with the Brits - too right!
We should leave, taking our EUR 2 million an hour with us, and we would all be better off.
<D>
We are living in a period of economic uncertainty.
The European Union has a responsibility to see if it is possible to allow national and regional authorities flexibility so that better ownership can be taken of EU funds to deal with the unprecedented situation.
The measures in Commissioner Huebner's plan Cohesion Policy: Investing in the real economy are practical and they are measures which should be adopted by domestic authorities without delay.
The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) can now be used to provide partial funding for ecological investment in low-income housing, something that should be used to create and maintain jobs in the building industry - which is very hard hit - and that would help us to get closer to fulfilling our climate commitments at the same time.
Acknowledgment payments from the European Social Fund could really stimulate the struggling public sectors and small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) should benefit from the recommended changes to make cash flow more easily available.
This is a step in the right direction.
I find some of the language in Kirilov's report in relation to the Lisbon strategy regrettable.
<D>
(SV) Mr President, President-in-Office, Commissioner, let me begin by thanking the rapporteur for a job well done and an excellent report.
Like José Albino Silva Peneda, I prefer to speak of 'change with security', change which we encounter in the form of globalisation and in the form of demographic growth.
I think that is a better way of putting it.
There is a difference between the Commission's proposal and Parliament's proposal, namely on the point of where the focus lies in the changes.
We have a different focus in Parliament's proposal.
The Commission's focus is on employment security rather than job security.
There should be no such distinction.
What is needed is to combine the security of being able to get a new job with a high level of security in employment.
In Parliament we try to focus on participation in the process, strong trade unions and a strong social dialogue.
We focus on an active employment policy, we focus on more investment in training and we focus on strong social security systems.
Many have said that there is no single model but that all must proceed on the basis of their own concepts.
The Lisbon process is applicable.
Now, when principles are to be established, I would endorse what Stephen Hughes said: look at paragraph 15, see what principles should form the guidelines.
Finally I would say to Elisabeth Schroedter that it is not the case that the rapporteur had no contact with the European trade union movement.
There were close contacts throughout the period, and they fully support us in seeking to change the focus.
To refrain from forming views before the employment ministers do so would mean handing over to them the sole right to decide.
Parliament must have a line ...
(The President cut off the speaker.)
<D>
in writing. - I supported resolution RC7-0154/2010 on the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, and I am glad that a large majority of Parliament did so.
ACTA risks becoming known as the 'Absence of Commission Transparency Agreement'.
In its negotiations on ACTA, the Commission should be upholding the principles of transparency, human rights and the EU Parliament's legal right to information.
Instead, the Commission is failing this litmus test of its compliance in informing Parliament under the terms of the Lisbon Treaty.
The EU cannot continue to negotiate on ACTA if the people are not allowed to take part in the process.
It is also a totally absurd and unacceptable situation if MEPs, behind closed doors, have to ask the Commission about the content of the agreements we are supposed to vote on.
Furthermore, the EU Parliament has shown that it does not accept secrecy and that it cherishes an open Internet for all.
MEPs have also shown that the Parliament will not accept to be treated like a doormat.
The Commission has been strongly urged to keep us fully and immediately informed on the ACTA negotiations.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, we are very shocked at the Russian Government's closure of all the regional offices of the British Council.
These regional offices have been sacrificed as a result of the worsening relations between Russia and the United Kingdom.
Can civil society in Russia expect nothing more than this kind of provocation?
The murder of Alexander Litvinenko has still not been solved and Russia refuses to cooperate in the matter.
The chief suspect, Andrei Lugovoi, has been a member of the Duma since the end of 2007.
The circumstances surrounding the death of Anna Politkovskaya have also still not been explained.
Is criticism being stifled under a mantle of secrecy or is it simply being eradicated?
The EU must call on Russia to respect human rights and the rule of law.
We can set an example by naming our press office after Anna Politkovskaya.
<D>
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at a time when we are talking a lot about Asia because of China and the problems we are aware of there, as well as the deadly disaster in Burma, on another level, the report we are discussing this evening essentially constitutes the response of EU citizens represented by Parliament to the Commission communication on the new strategy for the EU's bilateral and interregional trade negotiations.
It is stating the obvious to say that the Association of South East Asian Nations is a collection of ten countries with particularly diverse levels of development, both politically and economically, as our rapporteur has just said.
The trade agreement currently under discussion is looking at a market worth EUR 57 billion with 4.9% annual growth, which represents a very important potential for development.
Although the EU's trade policy, consisting of a trade agreement between our two regions, seems straightforward, together we need to stimulate growth and job creation, and remain realistic about the difficulties.
However, although the globalisation of the economy should be seized as an opportunity, our fellow citizens are often very concerned about the economy of our continent, as others are about theirs.
The negative, marginal effects of globalisation, - too numerous for those who actually have to live with them - often obscure the benefits that should ensue from intelligently negotiated trade agreements.
This report therefore aims to send strong signals to the European Commission to take the concerns of citizens properly into account, when in negotiations with ASEAN.
We therefore need to achieve a balance - one that allows our partners to achieve a satisfactory level of economic, social and political development without encouraging distortions of competition and dumping.
I would just like to highlight three points here that I feel are priorities.
Firstly, from a strictly commercial point of view, it should be pointed out that any trade agreement has to be reached within the framework of mutual respect for the rules of international trade, which means respect for the rules of competition law and respect for copyright law.
One example among many is that our negotiations must, in particular, find solutions in the fight against counterfeit pharmaceuticals, for example, while guaranteeing access to healthcare for all citizens in strict compliance with the spirit and procedures of the Doha agreement.
Secondly, from the point of view of employment rights, the agreements clearly cannot overlook differences in levels of employment rights.
Our partners must agree to meet the ILO minimum standards, in particular combating child labour and improving working conditions and pay.
Thirdly and finally, of course it is also very important to point out, as has been done this evening in the various speeches, that any trade agreement must include the necessary requirements as regards the economy and sustainable development.
Southeast Asia is one of the jewels of our planet, and together we need to protect its flora and fauna.
The Commission has a duty to secure guarantees regarding illegal forestry operations and the management of fishing quotas, as the Commissioner pointed out just a minute ago.
<D>
I will answer Mr Posselt.
The Paris-Strasbourg-Stuttgart-Vienna-Bratislava railway axis No 17 is one of the 30 priority projects of the trans-European transport network.
The Stuttgart 21 project that you mentioned is a major link in this priority project.
On 19 July 2007, an agreement was signed between Mr Tiefensee, the German Minister for Transport, and the authorities in the Federal State of Bade-Wurtemberg, the region and city of Stuttgart and Deutsche Bahn.
This agreement is a key phase in the elimination of the bottleneck represented by the Stuttgart-Ulm section, since it includes funding for the work to start in 2010.
The Commission is keeping a close eye on the modernisation of the sections between Stuttgart and Ulm.
In July 2005 it appointed a European coordinator for this line, Mr Péter Balázs, who has already submitted his second report.
This report was sent to the Chairman of Parliament's Committee on Transport and Tourism.
It is available on the website of the Directorate-General for Energy and Transport.
The coordinator, Mr Balázs, is continuing to give great attention to the Stuttgart-Ulm bottleneck, which must be eliminated.
In his report, the coordinator analysed the progress of the Paris-Bratislava priority project and concluded that most of the project could be completed in 2015.
However, given the complexity of the Stuttgart-Ulm section, this section will not be built until 2019.
It is clear that a priority project does not exclude continuation to other destinations.
Other priority projects, such as the Athens-Sofia-Budapest-Vienna-Prague-Nuremberg-Dresden axis, will extend the Paris-Bratislava project as far as the Black Sea and Greece, while the Eurocaprail priority No 28 project will link Brussels to Strasbourg via Luxembourg.
In July 2007 Member States submitted their proposals for Community cofinancing.
These proposals are currently being evaluated.
Based on this evaluation, the Commission will propose the RTE-T budget allocation for the period 2007-2013 to the European Parliament and Council.
Those are the answers I wanted to give you, Mr Posselt.
Personally I am extremely interested in the Paris-Budapest axis, and I can tell you that Mr Balázs and I are really keen for every effort to be made to complete this major project.
<D>
It is extremely difficult for an MEP to see a democracy such as Italy have the finger pointed at it, as this debate is intended to do.
Freedom of the press is a fundamental freedom enshrined in Article 21 of the Italian Constitution.
In Italy, there are private and public newspapers reflecting all political tendencies.
Out of respect for thousands of people who suffer oppression and a lack of free expression in many countries in the world, it is obscene to describe the Italian regime as a freedom-destroying regime.
Moreover, one of the most fundamental characteristics of any constitutional state is that they offer access to the courts to any citizen who feels wronged.
Thus, the fact that a Prime Minister of the Republic who has been slandered in national newspapers has chosen the legal route to attack his detractors, and not parallel routes characteristic of undemocratic regimes, confirms the good health of Italian democracy.
Lastly, it is crucial to point out that the European Parliament must not become a chamber in which contentious national issues that have no connection with Community competences are settled.
National debates must be settled at national level!
<D>
First of all, I would like to begin by thanking Mr Rack for his hard work.
Urban mobility is a complicated issue for policy preparation at European level.
It is not easy to demarcate responsibilities and that can be seen in the report we are debating here.
On the one hand, the report states in various places that the European Union has a role in the realisation of urban mobility plans, and then elsewhere in the report it states that urban mobility is a responsibility of the European cities and local authorities and, on the grounds of the subsidiarity principle, the European Union should only have a limited regulatory role.
In short, weighing up responsibilities in this area is difficult.
I do think though that the rapporteur, Mr Rack, has dealt with this issue well and has worded the text well with regard to the subsidiarity principle.
I have a couple of criticisms, however.
Firstly, I think that the report has become too detailed.
This creates the impression that it is possible to design a European framework that could be used to solve all the problems in all European cities.
I understand the detailed list of topics to be considered for harmonisation and the list of areas for action and they are well intentioned, but I question whether we can take them much further.
I think that a general approach would have been more practical.
This would have put more emphasis on exchanging best practices and on technological developments in the area of urban mobility.
I realise that this approach is less ambitious, but I think that we should remember that urban mobility is a matter for the European cities and local authorities.
What is more, the list of topics for harmonisation also contains some social norms.
This does not seem a good idea to me.
Social norms, such as the mobility of disadvantaged travellers, are very closely bound to individual Member States and so are better not harmonised or standardised.
Despite these criticisms, I will vote for the report.
The fact is that Mr Rack has succeeded in clearly emphasising in the report that a safe, sustainable and effective urban mobility structure is a matter for the cities and local authorities of Europe and I think that this is where the great merit of this report lies.
The European Union can extend a helping hand by means of directed funding and the exchange of relevant information, but EU regulations are not needed in this area, nor are they desirable.
I would like to finish by saying that we should not lose sight in all this of the fact that the responsibility for urban transport systems remains with the towns and cities of Europe.
They will have to develop systems and work effectively with all the relevant authorities.
Finally, I would point out that the success of these transport systems stands or falls with citizen participation.
They also have a responsibility to contribute to the goals of the urban mobility plans: sustainable, safe and reliable transport in urban areas.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - (RO) The Commission has no intention to present a new programme of concrete promotion of the use of less widespread languages in Europe in the near future.
In fact, the Commission's 2007-2013 new generation of programmes, namely the lifelong learning programme, offers a broad range of financing possibilities for these languages.
All the languages are eligible for this programme.
Financing is accessible in all the 4 sub-programmes of the lifelong learning programme: COMENIUS, ERASMUS, Grundvig and Leonardo da Vinci.
This financing is also possible in the newly-created transversal section of the lifelong learning programme, especially by way of the key activity - foreign languages - which proposes the financing of projects and networks with the established purpose to promote the learning of foreign languages and language diversity.
Following the 2007 general call for proposals, a network and three projects designed for less widespread languages were selected for funding as part of the key activity 2.
For the period of 2008-2010, priority will be given to the projects aiming at less widespread languages in Europe.
In 2008, the available budget for the key activity 2 is of 9.9 million euros but, taking into account that the funding of language-related activities and projects is part of a dominant trend, additional funds are available in the lifelong learning programme.
<D>
Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Madam President, as this is the first time that I have spoken before this new Parliament, I would like to congratulate you on being elected to the Vice-Presidency.
As far as the Weber report is concerned, I speak on behalf of Vice-President Barrot and I would like first of all to thank the rapporteur and the members of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs for the excellent quality of their work.
The Commission welcomes the report and supports some of the proposed amendments.
The Commission is, by and large, in favour of the proposal presented by five Member States, although the text is not as ambitious as it would have wished.
More specifically, the Commission deplores the fact that the scope of the framework decision has been limited to cases where the same person is subject to parallel criminal proceedings for the same offence.
The Commission also regrets the fact that the obligation to refer to Eurojust cases where there is a conflict of jurisdiction has been limited and that the list of criteria which must be taken into account to determine the most appropriate jurisdiction has been removed from the operative part of the text.
These amendments have weakened the text of the proposal, taking away most of its added value.
From the Commission's point of view, the proposal should be considered only as a first step towards the prevention and settlement of conflicts of jurisdiction in the framework of criminal proceedings and should subsequently be replaced with a more exhaustive proposal.
The Commission will also consider this in the light of the changes made in this area by the Treaty of Lisbon, which I hope will enter into force as soon as possible.
<D>
(DE) Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to thank Mrs Stavreva for her excellent report.
It is absolutely crucial that this economic programme, which we have adopted in its entirety today, is also available in rural areas.
Broadband is an indispensable means of communication for rural areas, especially in Austria, for new and modern jobs and for rapid information delivery.
It should not be overlooked that more than 50% of the population of the European Union lives in rural areas.
Ladies and gentlemen, I am coming to the end of my political career.
I would like to extend my sincerest thanks to all my colleagues, the Commission and all the institutions of the European Union, especially officials and staff, for their help and support.
It has been a pleasure to work with you all.
Finally I would like to thank the interpreters who had to interpret my Austrian German.
I am convinced that it must continue to be absolutely clear that the common agricultural policy, with its two pillars, is essential for the society of the European Union.
Farmers are naturally aware of their responsibility towards society.
But I also expect the society of the European Union to be aware of its responsibility towards all those who safeguard its resources.
With this in mind, I wish the European Union all the best for the future.
(Applause)
<D>
rapporteur. - Mr President, the EU and its Member States have committed themselves to pursuing gender equality and women's empowerment as one of the key priorities of the international agenda.
Yet, closer inspection reveals that the practical implementation of gender mainstreaming in the EU's external policies is still weak.
For instance, only eight of the 27 Member States have adopted national action plans on the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1325.
Furthermore, women are still seriously underrepresented in high-level posts in the Commission and the Council.
In fact, there is not a single female EU special representative at the moment.
For this reason, the report stresses that the EU needs to fully implement its commitments in this field.
For instance, the Commission should speed up its work on an EU action plan on gender equality.
I am convinced that this is key to strengthening the gender dimension in EU foreign policy.
Let me conclude by saying that women's rights are part of the broader concept of human and civic rights.
Without addressing gender equality and promoting women's rights in the EU's foreign policy, that policy cannot be effective.
(Applause)
<D>
(NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the debate on the Florenz motion for a resolution, it was rightly observed yesterday that a large majority of the population support strict measures to ban smoking at the workplace and in bars and restaurants.
I had hoped that this resolution would also take account of the view of an overwhelming majority of the population, that is that Turkey cannot join the European Union.
However, I am obviously cherishing too many illusions.
When it comes to crucial matters, such as the Constitution or the accession of Turkey to the European Union, the opinion of the people suddenly does not count any more.
Turkey, a friendly nation, is not a European country.
Full stop, amen, finished.
That should be the end of the discussion.
However, not only does Parliament not accept its responsibility, more than once it has been blind to specific recent developments that clearly demonstrate that Turkey does not belong in the European Union, and that the decision to start accession negotiations was a mistake.
Why does this resolution not mention the resistance of the AKP to a constitutional provision that would make conversion to another religion no longer punishable under the law?
Why are people so vague about the Armenian question and about Cyprus?
This is another example of European Realpolitik, which you can count us out of.
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE group. - (HU) Thank you, Mr President.
I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Schmidt, on his excellent work.
I believe today represents a breakthrough, as we have managed to hammer out a common parliamentary position on a broad consensual basis.
I think it is important to preserve here in plenary the common voice we found in our committee.
It is a success because we managed to set a minimum and maximum rate of excise duty to meet anti-inflationary objectives but ignored the idea of abolishing regulation in its entirety.
It is better to have an opinion than not to provide one at all, which would leave only the Commission proposal on the table.
It is a success because everyone is sacrificing something.
Countries with high rates of taxation are ready to freeze their current high rates in the interests of convergence, while low-rate countries are willing to accept some increase relative to the legislation currently in force in relation to diesel.
The biggest sacrifice in this regard is being made by the newly acceded Baltic and Balkan states, as prices and incomes in these countries are lower and they have taken on a huge challenge in terms of inflation and competitiveness, and also in the social sphere, particularly in the run-up to introducing the euro.
It is a success because it would halt Parliament's request show, its 'cherry-picking'.
By the end of 2015 everyone would fall within the proposed band, and there would no longer be a whole series of inexplicable individual exceptions.
This will enable us to reinforce the gravitas of European legislation.
I think discipline is important, and we therefore ask the Commission to provide an interim report on compliance in 2010, to check whether the adjusters are actually adjusting or merely dissembling.
It is a success because the Council will see that there is a way to achieve the desired convergence, while the Commission will grasp Parliament's philosophy, namely minimum and maximum rates, with the key point being to reduce rather than induce inflation.
It can reflect on this in future, too, when putting forward the scheduled Commission proposal on excise duties.
Thank you for your attention, Mr President.
<D>
rapporteur. - (EL) Mr President, I am delighted that we are debating and will be voting today on the report on improving our relations with Brazil.
The creation of a strategic relationship between the European Union and Brazil is of mutual benefit, firstly due to Brazil's changing position at global level to become a leading force in the developing world and, secondly, because Brazil plays a vital role in bridging differences on questions of global interest.
Over recent years, the European Union has maintained a very broad spectrum of relations with Brazil and a coordinated cohesive framework is therefore needed for relations on both sides.
Stronger relations will be based on historical, cultural and economic ties and on common values for democracy, the rule of law, human rights, concern about climate change and sustainable development, disarmament, energy and the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.
The strategic partnership must be substantial in scope and of a gradual nature.
Brazil is also a country of decisive importance to Mercosur.
It must therefore commit, within the partnership, to strengthening relations between the European Union and Mercosur and addressing questions of common interest.
Within this framework, the strategic relationship will be a means of deepening interregional, economic and trade relations.
Due to its enhanced role in the area and its active involvement in the UN, Brazil can, I believe, play an essential role in preventing and resolving regional conflicts in Latin America, thereby helping to consolidate peace in the area.
In light of the global economic crisis, the European Union and Brazil must cooperate at World Trade Organization level with a view to the successful conclusion of negotiations on the Doha Development Agenda.
Brazil is in a position to do more to address the new challenges of the global economy, given that regulatory matters play an important part in safeguarding competition law and in sustainable development.
As far as the reform of the financial system is concerned, its membership of international fora may help in reviewing the role of international institutions in the surveillance and regulation of financial markets.
Like other developing powers, Brazil is becoming more and more active in international efforts to deal with global poverty and inequality through cooperation programmes with the long-term objective of sustainable development.
As far as environmental protection is concerned, Brazil is the country with the largest areas of vital rainforests.
The European Union and Brazil must cooperate proactively at international level to protect them and to address climate change and the loss of biodiversity.
Political undertakings need to be made to implement the UN Convention on Biological Diversity.
Action also needs to be taken to protect and manage water resources.
I should say at this point that Brazil is the first country to develop important biofuel production, thereby achieving tangible results in reducing emissions of greenhouse gases.
Consequently, exchanging experiences and cooperating in this sector may prove to be very useful to the European Union and, conversely, renewable energies and energy-saving measures will be very useful to Brazil.
Migration is one basic issue on the European political agenda.
Consequently, the strategic partnership should, in light of the Lima Declaration, promote a wide-ranging dialogue on migration, covering regular and irregular migration and the protection of migrants' human rights.
Finally, the European Parliament welcomes the launching of negotiations on a visa agreement between the two sides, which will facilitate the free movement of people.
<D>
Madam President, we are in the midst of a deep financial crisis that is unique from very many perspectives.
It is unique because it is the first global financial crisis we have seen and we are also in a recession in the world economy.
But it might be good to have some sort of perspective on the events and the developments we are going through, because we have also seen 25 years of unprecedented and unique global economic growth that has made it possible for more than two billion people to leave poverty.
I must say I have heard very little of this from that part of the Chamber here tonight when they are saying that the open economy has failed.
Is it a failure that two billion people have left poverty?
Of course not.
But we do see a new structure in the global economy today, and the fact that the meeting in Washington was a G20 meeting and not a G7 meeting is an expression of the new reality we are living in.
I think that is good, because the whole dominance of the transatlantic economy is not there any more.
In general, that is a good thing because it means that other parts of the world have been able to develop prosperity.
It has, during this period, created imbalances: huge surpluses in countries such as China, and huge deficits in countries such as the US, coupled with a unique and artificially low interest rate in the US economy which has increased the credit volume more than ever.
It is interesting to note that we have had the same debate in this Chamber with colleagues from that side calling for lowering interest rates even further.
Had we done so, the problems in Europe would have been even bigger than they are.
Now we need to see to it that we can restructure and recover the global economy, and I think that the European Union has an important and crucial role to play in that.
We need to make sure that we do what was said at the Washington meeting, secure free trade and open markets and say 'no' to protectionism, because that would hinder recovery more than anything else.
We need to make sure that the regulatory framework of the global financial markets catches up with the reality of how the world economy looks today.
That is our task, and we must take a lead in that and develop prosperity even more.
<D>
Mr President, you wait for one report on buses and trucks and three come along at once.
The question is, are they all travelling in the right direction?
On cabotage: I am one of the strongest supporters in this Parliament of liberalisation, and indeed in general on the issue of cabotage.
But, of course, I want to be absolutely certain that we do have a genuine level playing field for this to operate.
We have different vehicle and road safety standards in the UK, we have a geographical seclusion, we have a particular tax system which is different to some others, and there are employment concerns: these are issues also to take into account.
So, whilst I think there is a lot of clarity in the Commission proposal and I welcome it, I think that we have to be very careful in the opening-up of the market in the way proposed.
The overall impact of cabotage is somewhat ambiguous and I know that a lot of hauliers, people involved in the industry, are very concerned.
Therefore, I think we have to be sensible and balanced about this and I certainly would like to see a review of the proposal within four years of implementation with full consultation from the industry in the meantime.
That is the only way I think that we can guarantee a level playing field and full liberalisation to have good effect.
I would just like to add another point on another of the reports.
I am concerned, for example, when the scope of regulation in Europe begins to extend to the transport of the elderly by volunteers.
Surely the application of law to such groups is both unnecessary and unhelpful.
European law should aim to always encourage mobility and access.
I think that in this case, in the beautiful areas of Britain such as my own constituency of Yorkshire, we do not want any impediments to the enjoyment of our regions and this road transport package coupled with the drivers' hours regulation should not lead to public transport in rural areas becoming a thing of the past.
<D>
It is positive that the number of Member States participating in these resettlement programmes has been increasing in recent years.
Nonetheless, only 10 Member States resettle refugees on a yearly basis, without any coordination among themselves or a joint EU resettlement programme.
It is important that the Member States show solidarity with each other and fairly share responsibility for compliance with international obligations.
An effective and sustainable European resettlement programme will bring benefits for the refugees being resettled, for the Member States, and for the EU itself by giving it a leading role in the international humanitarian field.
A multilateral approach is desirable, involving all the relevant actors at local level and without forgetting the fundamental role played by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees.
An effective EU resettlement programme must provide lasting protection and solutions, as well as the creation of mechanisms for cooperating and coordinating between the Member States.
Such a programme must allow the exchange of best practices, create a joint strategy and reduce the costs of resettlement operations.
I support the suggestion by the rapporteur - Mr Tavares, whom I congratulate on an excellent report - to create a resettlement unit that makes it possible to coordinate and facilitate resettlement processes.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, I should like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Borloo.
You will be combating unemployment and poverty in the coming months and years.
We therefore require a sensible package.
We do not need free allocation up to 100% in the industry affected by carbon leakage, we need 100% allocation, and we need ex ante benchmarks.
For those businesses not at risk from carbon leakage, I believe the 20/20 solution is the best so that we can start with 20% increases and also achieve the target with 20% increases.
We also want the small and medium-sized businesses to be exempted here, that is to say, in particular, the businesses with 25 000 tonnes, which are to be increased to 50 000 tonnes.
Then we would still have 80% of SMEs outside which have only 27% of the CO2.
We should also make an effort to keep the money in the businesses and not to tax it and send it abroad.
We urgently need the money in the businesses in order to be able to promote innovation and research.
Please also ensure that decreasing depreciation is possible, so that businesses can invest in these areas quickly and in good time.
We also need a formula in the international agreement which specifies up to 30% and not 30% as an absolute figure.
We also need a clear idea of what an international agreement must contain.
In the case of heat pumps, I would request that we really ensure that air-air heat pumps are also included accordingly because in that way, together with solar energy, we can naturally prevent a great deal of CO2.
I also request that we make the International Atomic Energy Safety Standards mandatory for the European nuclear industry and that we have independent regulators in Europe who can also share in decision-making in the other Member States in order to ensure safety here.
<D>
in writing. - (DE) I am voting in favour of Mrs Svensson's report on advertising, which continues to be discriminatory.
Despite the measures that have been taken against it, gender stereotyping remains a major issue in society.
Advertisements, in particular, tend to perpetuate tired old stereotypes of men and women.
Children and young people, especially, identify with characters in advertisements and absorb the clichés they present.
This should be prevented, so that the younger generation can deal more practically with the issue of gender equality.
In my opinion, specific training programmes on gender equality would be a good place to start and, above all, something must be done about the ubiquitous stereotyping in textbooks.
In summary, it can be said that advertising confronts all citizens in their daily life and it must therefore present good role models.
The report paves the way towards achieving the goal that has been set.
<D>
(HU) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, every Member State produces radioactive waste.
This is why we should not only take care of the spent fuel of the power plants with a view to protecting the environment and citizens' health, but also ensure safe and efficient management of radioactive waste in general.
For that reason alone it is indeed appropriate to discuss this issue here, in the European Parliament today.
I agree that the utilisation of nuclear power belongs to national sovereignty.
However, the establishment of basic EU principles related to national waste management regulations is justified.
In the absence of such principles and as a result of divergent regulations, market players are interested in managing their radioactive waste in countries with the most permissive regulations.
This is why the initiative to make Member States establish binding waste management programmes is promising.
One of its prerequisites, however, is to appoint competent authorities who can provide a strict control of nuclear waste management activities and can penalise violations in an appropriate manner, if necessary.
I believe that national programmes must also clarify the competence of such authorities and the responsibility of market players.
I would like to conclude with one final remark: full-scale management of spent fuel and radioactive waste is a very costly activity.
This means that national programmes are useless unless financing issues are clarified.
Setting aside the financial resources required for nuclear waste management as early as in the course of nuclear waste production is an important basic principle.
I agree that those who produced the waste have to bear the costs of waste management.
This will provide an appropriate incentive for market players to reduce radioactive waste quantities and manage them efficiently.
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (SL) I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Özdemir, on his fine work and I would like to thank him for his cooperation on this report, which expresses the clear political will of the European Union for greater strategic cooperation between the European Union and the countries of central Asia, whose democratic and economic progress is important for global stability.
The report welcomes in realistic and favourable terms the progress achieved by the countries of this region in many different areas.
At the same time it is constructively critical of political shortcomings, especially in the areas of human rights, democracy, the rule of law, environmental protection and health.
The report was prepared with full awareness of the diversity of the countries of central Asia and with the conviction that it is of mutual interest to deepen the cooperation not only in the area of energy, but also in the broader area of politics and security and in other fields.
The aspiration for new dynamic relationships is also reflected in the proposal to assess the progress in cooperation every two years, and in the suggestion that the European Commission should urgently provide for the establishment of delegations in all central Asian countries.
The countries of central Asia and all the Member States of the European Union are participants in OSCE and are committed to the same values and principles.
Kazakhstan will take over the Presidency of OSCE in 2010, and it has thereby gained great confidence and will be the first of the countries of central Asia to take over such an important responsibility.
I hope that this fact will also contribute to further democratic and all-round progress in Kazakhstan and all the other countries of the region, and to closer links with the European Union.
Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that, where central Asia is concerned, the European Commission, the Council and Parliament are speaking the same language.
It is time to elevate the relationship and cooperation between the European Union and the countries of central Asia to a higher level on the basis of a clear and binding strategy.
<D>
in writing. - (FI) The EU's Maritime Policy is one of the main initiatives for which the current Commission will be remembered in a good light.
This proposal for a Council regulation on the protection of vulnerable marine ecosystems in the high seas from the adverse impacts of bottom fishing gears is a necessary addition to the EU's strategy.
When a halt to biodiversity loss was made an objective at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in 2002, the year 2010 was set as the deadline.
Now, to our regret, we have to say that that aim is not going to be achieved in two years' time.
Although environmental targets have been at the top of the world's political agenda for more than twenty years now, many factors still threaten maritime biodiversity.
Scientific research has shown that, in spite of the high yields associated with deep sea fishing, poorly organised fishing practices can lead to the destruction of certain species in less than 10 years.
We need to remember that, although such new approaches as these applied in the fishing sector are necessary, woefully little is known about the recovery of deep sea fish species, and all in all the threats to the deep sea ecosystems are much greater.
This proposal for a regulation on the fishing industry is nevertheless a clear and necessary one.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Thank you for your concern and for the message indirectly from the President of UEFA, Michel Platini; we met repeatedly, and I even have a description of the 'home-grown player' proposal.
Now, we urge more common action, including the possible inclusion of sport in the Reform Treaty - it is in the mandate and in the draft.
We are not asking for power; in the White Paper we are asking for cooperation, for very concrete actions, which range throughout many areas - education, training, social inclusion, public health - but also, on the other hand, repressing phenomena such as violence, racism, corruption in sport or individual organisations or events.
We cannot just wait for the next Treaty, or even take any consensus reached today for granted in the future.
We should act today for a better future, whether in football or in other areas.
I think that the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council can address many of the problems, and, as I said, together we can do a lot.
It does not mean that we have to intervene at EU level.
For example, if we agree in October at ministerial level on the content of an amendment or improvement to our code on anti-doping convention or rules within the World Anti-Doping Agency, then this is the action against doping.
I recall Mr Mavrommatis and many colleagues who claimed urgent action from the Union when I became Commissioner in 2004 against doping, which was the problem of the Olympic Games.
Doping is a very visible, damaging and influential cancer or phenomenon in sport.
There we can do a lot, but we have to act, not only discuss, and that is our approach now.
Subject: Biofuels
When does the Commission expect to adopt proposals for certification of crops intended for the production of biofuels, or of biofuels themselves, with a view to ensuring that EU demand for such products does not increase the rate of destruction of tropical forests?
<D>
Concrete steps have been taken to make European citizenship a reality.
This will particularly benefit Portuguese migrants in other Community countries who will in the future enjoy a wide range of rights and obligations, including equal treatment with regard to nationals of the host State.
The most significant development has undoubtedly been the adoption of the Citizenship Directive, which laid down an unconditional right of permanent residence for EU citizens and their families who have lived in the host State for a period of five years.
However, there is still much to do as there are still obstacles, resulting in most cases from incorrect implementation of this Directive by the Member States.
I welcome the Commission's initiative to publish a Guide on this Directive so that information on the rights that can be enjoyed by citizens can be made accessible not only to them, but also to local and regional authorities in the Member States.
It is vital that social and political ties between EU citizens continue to be strengthened.
The Treaty of Lisbon must significantly contribute to this, particularly through the 'citizenship initiative', which will enable citizens, under certain conditions, to have a right of initiative.
<D>
in writing. - (PT) There can be no doubt that what is known as 'volunteering' fulfils a very important social role as a contribution to finding answers to citizens' problems and needs, namely by promoting effective solidarity and mutual assistance.
For this reason we disagree with the idea of 'volunteering' as a matter of 'significant savings for public services'.
On the contrary, we consider that the more States improve the public services offered and guaranteed to their citizens, the more important the role of volunteering will be.
As is mentioned, it is vital to ensure that 'voluntary activity is additional to public services and not a replacement of them'.
'Volunteering' cannot be used as a pretext or a means of encouraging States to neglect their responsibilities, specifically their social duties, by handing them over to pseudo-charitable organisations.
It is with this backdrop in mind that we are fighting for the need for effective and adequate support for non-profit organisations, among many others, the cooperative movement, local bodies and companies, residents' committees and sports, recreational, cultural, youth or children's associations.
Lastly, we underscore the fact that voluntary activity also depends on workers having free time, hence the need to avoid over-exploitation through working hours, low salaries or precariousness.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, I should like to make just two brief comments.
Firstly, I would ask our Commissioner to convey the concern resounding today to the Ministers for the Interior.
We have been told that PNR data offer opportunities for fighting crime.
Indeed, many here in Parliament have affirmed this.
The issue that preoccupies us, however, is whether this is proportionate.
We are storing millions, even billions of data for 10 years for perhaps a handful of cases.
Is that proportionate?
This is the concern preoccupying us all.
The second thing I want to say is that I do not understand why we are talking of a European PNR system.
The proposal on the table involves the development of 27 national PNR systems, not a European PNR system.
If Member States have such a pressing need for this tool in order to fight crime, we would suggest that the Ministers for the Interior go to their national parliaments and discuss and implement it there.
Discussing common data standards is one thing - but making it a mandatory objective for the Justice and Home Affairs Council is another.
Personally, I sense that the Ministers for the Interior have been unable to push this through at home, at national level, and are consequently seeking to do so via the Council.
Therefore, we must say 'no'.
<D>
(FR) Mr President, for my part, I would like to add my voice to those who have already spoken to denounce the particularly worrying situation in which the journalist and writer Taoufik Ben Brik finds himself in Tunisia.
In the wake of several arrests of journalists and trade unionists, who have suffered violence and mistreatment, and of the refusal to grant entry to foreign journalists during the presidential elections, the repression against political opponents and human rights activists continues.
After a botched trial, and his incarceration far from his family, which makes visits difficult, Taoufik Ben Brik has been left in a state of health that makes one fear for his life.
How can one fail to regard this situation as a fierce attack against someone who upsets the apple cart?
For this reason, we must not simply use trade as an answer to everything.
On the contrary, I believe it is crucial for the EU to react quickly and firmly by demanding the release of Taoufik Ben Brik and other prisoners of conscience.
There has been an alarming decline in the human rights situation in Tunisia.
It is affecting Europe's cooperation with the country, and a tangible improvement in this situation represents one of the conditions for the opening of negotiations on an advanced status for the EU-Tunisia partnership.
<D>
in writing. - I congratulate the rapporteur on this report.
I believe the Internet has enhanced Europeans' lives in countless ways.
It has increased our ability to access knowledge, aided our understanding of the world around us and reinforced our social connections to other people.
But constituents tell me they are also concerned about the dangers of the Internet.
We have remarkable technology at our fingertips, but the very freedom it gives us has also left criminals free to abuse the technology.
This report, in its focus on fundamental rights, will go a long way to making the Internet safer.
We spoke during the last part-session on the need to tackle child pornography.
Through balancing liberty and security, the proposals we have voted on today will form a further vital tool in the fight against that threat.
The report also raises concerns about e-literacy.
We cannot move forward as a society together if, by promoting new freedoms for some, we restrict the rights of those who are less familiar with the Internet.
We have gladly taken on board the profound changes the Internet has wrought.
To move even further forward, our focus should now shift to dealing with the negatives of this revolution just as willingly.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, let me first of all, on behalf of the European Commission, say that we deeply regret the assassination of His Excellency the President of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, João Bernardo Vieira.
We condemn this assassination in the strongest possible terms and also the attacks that resulted in the deaths of the Chief of Staff of the armed forces, General Batista Tagme Na Waie and other soldiers.
I would like also to send condolences to their families.
The presence of drug-dealers and so much crime are more than worrying today.
Under the eighth EDF and other instruments, but in addition by contributing to EUR 2 million to the UN ODC, the Commission has signed up to a very ambitious plan in the counter narcotics field.
We think this is really very important, as has been shown by what has happened.
We urgently call for calm and restraint, and urge the national authorities of Guinea-Bissau to fully investigate these events and bring to justice those responsible.
There should be no impunity.
Unfortunately, these violent acts follow the successful legislative elections, which paved the way for enhanced EU and international support for the country's peace-building efforts.
These attacks also come at a time of increased international engagement, intended to build a democratic and a stable Guinea-Bissau.
Under these extremely difficult circumstances, the Commission remains fully committed to continuing its strong support to the national authorities, aiming to bring back stability but also to sustain development.
I am thinking of education, the poorest of the poor, the necessity for basic needs and basic services, and also of economic growth in the country.
We are now starting to deploy the wide range of instruments at our disposal, thus aiming to help Guinea-Bissau achieve sustainable peace and, hopefully, consolidate its democratic process.
An ambitious country strategy paper for an amount of EUR 100 million, covering the period 2008-2013, was approved last year.
This will focus on security sector reform - including the fight against drugs that I mentioned earlier - and the enhancement of the national sovereign institutions.
Last year the Council also decided to establish an EU mission supporting security sector reform in the framework of the European security and defence policy.
The forthcoming presidential elections - now expected 60 days after the nomination of the new President - will probably take place even before the summer break.
Taking into account this extremely tight schedule, the feasibility of the deployment of the electoral observation mission is being carefully considered by the Commission.
Nevertheless, the provision of post-electoral assistance to support the required reforms to the electoral framework, following the recommendations formulated by the EU-UN 2008, and the support given to observation of the forthcoming elections by regional organisations remain, among other things, our key priorities.
<D>
This is another report that is full of contradictions.
On the one hand, it has some positive aspects, which we appreciate, defending industry and small and medium-sized enterprises.
The presence of modern and efficient industry which creates jobs and is environmentally sustainable is an important tool for development in every country and region.
However, the current framework of EU policies, in which the most negative aspects have been worsening over the years, is markedly unfavourable to this endeavour.
Rather, it has been promoting the dismantling of important productive centres, deindustrialisation, the elimination of jobs, and growing dependence in innumerable countries and regions.
Liberalisation and international trade deregulation policies are a central tenet of this policy framework, and are contributing decisively to the current situation.
However, the report insists on advocating these policies.
It endorses them, while ignoring their effects.
It also insists on the sacrosanct principle of 'free competition' and the deepening of the internal market, both offshoots of the aforementioned framework, on public-private partnerships, and even on synergies between civilian and military investment.
The Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left sought to eliminate these most negative aspects from the report, while keeping the aspects that are good.
Unfortunately, all the proposals were rejected by the majority in Parliament.
That is why we voted against.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like once again to thank Ms Haug for the report and also all the speakers for their comments: not only those related directly to the 2009 budget, but also those comments that went beyond 2009, which are very useful in the context of our reflection on the policy agenda and on the future reform of the budget.
Concerning the Baltic Sea strategy, I would like to react to two very concrete points which were raised.
Firstly, on the Baltic Sea strategy: the Commission is working on this strategy, and I have the pleasure of chairing the inter-service work on this strategy.
It is envisaged that it will be on the agenda of the Swedish presidency, which means the second half of 2009.
However, we are at the stage of consulting and taking stock of the situation in the region and also considering ideas for this strategy.
With regard to any budget consequences, it is far too early to talk about this today.
Concerning the new Treaty and the consequences for the policy agenda, one issue is the consequences of the Lisbon Treaty for the institutional change and the new legal frameworks.
The other thing is the policy agenda and, as you know, both the Council and the Commission are currently involved in the reflection and very concrete work, mostly on the legal frameworks and new institutional challenges.
However, reflection on the policy agenda is also taking place, as you know, as a result of the requirement to have the budget review.
I believe that towards the end of this year - or very early in 2009 - the Commission will come forward with the new policy agenda, and only then can the budgetary consequences be considered and taken care of in a reasonable way and with reasonable responsibility.
Concerning transparency, I have taken note of all your points on screening results and shall forward them, especially to Commissioner Grybauskaitė, but I think to the entire college, and I would like to confirm what you have just said.
With regard to 2009, my understanding is that we are now aware of the guidelines which were expressed by both arms of the budgetary authority.
The preliminary draft budget will be based on sound estimates of the need to achieve all those priorities that have been already agreed and which are ahead of us.
There is no doubt that the Commission will need good ongoing cooperation with you to attain these results.
I would also like to say that good cooperation will also be essential in the context of long-term challenges, both the institutional and the policy agenda ones.
Thank you very much for the debate.
<D>
in writing. - (HU) The natural disasters in the summer.
Climate change has turned this summer into a catalogue of catastrophes.
Record floods, droughts and forest fires have caused devastation across Europe.
In Hungary a significant proportion of the maize crop was destroyed due to drought, and more than 400 hectares fell victim to flames in forest fires even though our fire-fighters bravely stood their ground in Hungary - and in Greece too.
Now the EU has to draw the right lessons from these events.
I would like to remind you that arson, deliberate fire-raising, is suspected in the case of the conflagrations both in Greece and in Sicily.
It is of great importance that the damage caused in the course of any incident of arson where protected natural assets are damaged or destroyed does not lead to a change in the official status of these areas.
If it is possible to circumvent the authorities with a deliberately discarded cigarette butt, and if permits, for example building permits, rejected for environment protection reasons can thus be acquired, then soon the whole of Europe will be in flames.
The European Union and its Member States must put particular focus on the proper restoration and reconstruction of these devastated areas.
Finally, I would draw attention to one small, unfortunately administrative shortcoming.
While it used to be possible, before putting early assistance into place, to get disaster relief funds from the Union quite quickly, even within two months, it now takes almost one year.
I hope that the Union will make changes to this practice and aid will once again be processed quickly.
Remember: to give quickly is to give double.
<D>
author. - (FR) Mr President, Mr Vice-President, Minister, 'it is high time to rekindle the stars'.
I wanted to begin my speech with this line from a Guillaume Apollinaire poem, to emphasise the importance for the European Parliament of relaunching its space policy.
For more than thirty years, the European Union and its Member States have worked together in financing, drawing up and developing space policy.
Alas, this policy has progressively lost its luminescence and radiance.
It is true that in 2003, the foundations of a European space policy were set out by the EC-ESA framework agreement.
It is also true that the 'Space' Council of 22 May 2007 was in line with the political continuum of this framework agreement.
However, the light emitted by this star remains insufficient.
For Europe's independence, its role on the international stage, its security and prosperity all come together to make this major policy an incomparable trump card for an industrial policy that creates both jobs and stimulates growth; an ambitious policy for cultural, economic and scientific influence that is reinforced on the international stage and is an essential vehicle for society to acquire the knowledge that we wish to gain.
In the institutional triangle of the Union, and to ensure that this does not turn into a Bermuda triangle, the European Parliament, on behalf of European citizens, must play an important and increased role in the drawing up and definition of this policy.
It is high time to rekindle the stars.
On 26 September 2008, the Council participated in this act and we want to make our mark on this policy.
Of course, this address here and now on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy is made in this same spirit.
To follow the correct route, it seems to me essential to remember the fundamental elements in the creation of this space policy.
Firstly, there is the question of the budget.
We call for, from this point onwards, the creation of a specific budget line to reflect and demonstrate our commitment to European space policy.
The space industries need sufficient public support to increase their research and development capacity and, quite simply, to remain profitable.
International competition is hard and fierce.
Whilst the United States, Russia, Japan and even India are significantly increasing their budget dedicated to the space industry, and multiplying public orders, us Europeans are still searching for the appropriate funding to achieve our ambitious aims like others search for lost time.
Consequently, what initiatives can the Commission take to improve the contribution to the European space sector, and be not just an actor, but the major actor responding to this growing, global demand, across all aspects of space policy from beginning to end?
The second point is the issue of strategic options for those applications linked, on the one hand, to Galileo and EGNOS and, on the other, to GMES, through the prism of governance to create an efficient structure generating a clear governance for a reinforced efficiency across all European space programmes.
The final issue is the exploration of space.
What is the long-term vision for our European space policy, and for what ends does it exist?
Embarking on the long-distance conquest of space is a project for several decades and requires both long-term vision and ambition
At this point, I see an echo of the speech made by President Kennedy, focusing the American people on a new uncrossed frontier.
Made sacred on 21 July 1969, this step was, without a doubt, in the technological history of our civilisation, the most fabulous catalyst for progress for all space-related and even everyday industries.
Give us, in this concert of nations, this long term vision.
Here we find ourselves at a milestone on this long journey.
Europe is at a crossroads with regard to space policy.
Space has, from now on, multiplied its spheres of action and application.
From scientific to defence activities, space covers sectors of activity as vast and as varied as environmental protection or the development of SMEs.
Let us get closer to users and increase the viability and quality of the collected data.
Let us become the leaders in the space market.
It is a duty that we owe to future generations to fortify this European space policy and make the vital choices to place into orbit an avant-garde and futuristic Europe for subsequent generations to live in.
Space is our new European frontier.
The great history book lies open with its dizzying array of blank pages.
Europe must not only play a part in it, but be the major actor.
Therefore, it is high time to rekindle the stars.
<D>
Mr President, Mr Svoboda, honourable Members, the Commission cannot fail to be delighted with the compromise reached on the road package, since it enables us to conclude the legislative procedure at a time when the transport industry needs to have simple and effective rules and be set free from pointless red tape.
I have to say that the decision we are taking will also help to make our roads safer, because I believe that whenever we take action in the sector of transport and especially road transport, we must always keep sight of our goal to halve the number of casualties on EU roads.
The rules that Parliament is adopting do, I think, help to achieve this objective.
We are also happy because this is another signal the European institutions are sending to citizens on the eve of the elections, and because the legislative procedure can be concluded at second reading, just two years after three major and complex legislative proposals were tabled.
They have perhaps made for difficult debate, but at the end of the day institutional and common sense has prevailed, as has the political will to meet the demands of citizens and the transport sector in general.
I would like to take a quick look at the reports we are debating, in order to give some answers to the questions asked by the rapporteurs.
I will begin with access to the international market for coach or bus transport services: it is true that cabotage represents a very limited section of the transport business as a whole, but, politically, it is a highly sensitive area.
If used in a way that complements international transport, cabotage also contributes towards a better use of capacity and a reduction in unladen journeys, meaning a reduction in the number of heavy goods vehicles on the road - and you will be aware of how many road accidents involve large vehicles.
This regulation will clarify the rules on cabotage, which will be applicable - and I refer here particularly to Mr Grosch's comment - in a uniform and non-bureaucratic fashion throughout the EU, without affecting existing cooperation between Member States under Article 306 of the Treaty.
Furthermore, cumbersome national procedures still in force will be abolished, in order to enable transport firms to make the best use of the possibilities of cabotage.
The Commission will keep a close eye on the evolution of the road transport market and will publish a report in 2013.
If deemed appropriate in that report and if the conditions for fair competition have been better harmonised, the Commission will propose that the cabotage market be opened up further.
The Commission has made a statement to this effect, which will be sent to the Parliament Secretariat for inclusion in the reports of this debate.
This statement will also be published in the Official Journal, alongside the legislative proposal.
I now come to Mrs Ţicău's work on common rules concerning the conditions to be complied with to pursue the occupation of road transport operator.
The Commission welcomes the introduction of a new 12-day rule.
This is a tailor-made measure that takes account of the very particular conditions of certain types of passenger transport that allow for a longer period than six days, but do not normally require a large number of driving hours, for example school trips, skiing holidays and certain excursions.
The new legislation also stipulates extremely rigorous measures so that road safety is not threatened, I can assure you.
There are currently 100 different types of Community licences in force in the EU, which often makes for difficult and lengthy checks.
Under the new legislation, there will be just one type and one standard format of Community licence used throughout the Union.
I now come to the third text in question: access to the international road haulage market.
In an increasingly open market, we need to harmonise the conditions imposed on the companies that compete in this market.
That is the purpose of the new regulation, which replaces a directive and at the same time tightens up the conditions that companies must meet.
Each firm will have to appoint a transport manager to be responsible for the efficient running of the business as a whole.
In addition, in order to avoid 'dummy companies', further guarantees must be supplied as regards companies' registered offices.
Further still, a new electronic register will be compiled in order to step up information sharing between national authorities and to make controls more intelligent and efficient.
This, too, helps to ensure road safety.
Finally, transport businesses are today receiving a very clear message from legislators concerning the more serious failings that lead to licences being withdrawn, for example the repeated cases of tachograph tampering.
This is unfortunately a practice that takes place in all EU countries, but the tampering not only constitutes a breach of the rules, it also threatens the safety of those who travel on Europe's roads, as it is clear that tired drivers are not able to respond quickly should problems arise.
That is why I said at the beginning of my speech that the laws about to be passed by this House make a serious and important contribution to our joint battle, as Commission and Parliament, to reduce drastically the number of road traffic casualties.
I would therefore like to thank you for your willingness to adopt these laws so quickly.
Let me repeat, this is a strong signal we are giving to European citizens, demonstrating once again that Parliament - and I say this not least because I served in this House for 15 years - has shown great efficiency and seriousness, for which I am grateful.
<D>
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all let me say that I have a great deal of respect for the rapporteur, Mr Cashman.
I always regard him as a great ally in the fight to defend fundamental rights.
Where I differ from the rapporteur, therefore, is not on the substance, the content, but on the strategy.
It might be a strategy to relinquish a couple of priorities in exchange for support from the Council, but is the Council offering us enough for us to abandon what we want?
Not in my opinion, and that being so I prefer just to state my position clearly.
The ALDE amendments propose four additional priorities, namely homophobia, privacy, counter-terrorist policy and fundamental rights, and discrimination against the Roma, and right now makes these the four main areas in which Member States continually breach human rights.
The Fundamental Rights Agency should have become a watchdog to keep the Member States on the right path, but unfortunately it has not managed to do that.
At any rate, it has already become a toothless tiger.
As far as I am concerned, and certainly also when I listened to what Commissioner Frattini has just said, the European Parliament, as the most important partner of the Fundamental Rights Agency, should simply set its own clear priorities.
Quite honestly, if we are counting on support from or agreement with the Council, I wonder anyway where the Council is today.
I am afraid, therefore, that I very much agree with the rapporteur on the content - I am going to consult in my group - but I regret to say that I cannot support the strategy.
<D>
in writing. - (PT) We regret that the report does not oppose, with sufficient clarity, the strategy of flexicurity defended by the European Commission.
It limits itself to proposing some palliative care for the principles set out in the Commission communication.
As a result, we not only voted against this report in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, but we also insisted on tabling proposals which rejected the flexicurity approach adopted in that communication.
We did this because this approach aims to deregulate the labour markets and labour legislation which will result, in practice, in the destruction of current contractual arrangements, in the liberalisation of unjustified dismissals and in increased insecurity for workers in general.
No palliative care can withstand the constant weakening of collective bargaining, the devaluation of the trade unions and the transformation of permanent contracts into temporary contracts on the pretext of capitalist globalisation.
In the huge demonstration that took place on 18 October in Lisbon, arranged by the CGTP (General Confederation of Portuguese Workers), Portuguese workers said no to these proposals.
What they want is more employment with rights which presupposes a commitment to production, more investment in high-quality public services and respect for the dignity of workers.
We therefore insist on the proposals that we tabled.
If these continue to be rejected, then we will vote against this report given that we reject flexicurity.
<D>
Vice-President of the Commission. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, better regulation is a highly political project.
At the last major debate on this issue here in this House in April last year, I emphasised that we want to achieve two objectives: firstly, we want to increase citizens' confidence in the entire system of European integration, and secondly, we must establish clear and dependable parameters for the European economy so that it can provide jobs and growth.
Since then, we have made good progress.
According to the polls, public endorsement of European integration is higher than it has been for a long time, our economic position has greatly improved and is looking bright, and we have a broad consensus for continuing the course embarked upon, based on our partnership for growth and employment.
As part of this policy for jobs and growth, better regulation is a key pillar.
Although the overall political situation is currently very favourable, we must not slacken our efforts now; on the contrary, we must utilise the current momentum.
After all, the mood can turn again just as swiftly, and we would be deluding ourselves if we believed that the European Union's image has already fundamentally changed.
People still have it firmly in their heads that everything that comes out of Europe is irrelevant, overblown in scope and centralistic.
This accusation is undoubtedly exaggerated, but it is important to recognise that this is the European public's perception.
We therefore have to work hard to counter this reflex.
We want a Europe of results.
We want a Europe which brings security, prosperity and environmental protection to all spheres of life.
That must be expressed in all our practical decisions in every area of policy, whether it be in chemicals law, in the pharmaceuticals industry, in information technology or in agriculture.
Make no mistake: better regulation is not an image campaign.
We have completely overhauled our policy style and the way in which we prepare and review legislation.
I say again: better regulation must not be viewed in isolation but as part of an overall strategy, a fundamentally new direction in European politics.
Similar attempts have been made in the past, but this project which we are talking about today has two very special features: its scope and its sustainability.
In the past, we have focused on ad hoc adjustments.
Now, however, we have extended the scope of the 'better regulation' concept to encompass the entire European legislative process, from assessing the need for a law, with strict subsidiarity checks, to broad consultation with stakeholder groups, assessment of economic, social and environmental policy impacts, to the issue of the best possible application and implementation of Community law.
However, better legislation not only relates to new initiatives; we are also in the process of reviewing the existing acquis in its entirety to determine where and how it can be simplified and updated.
The second new aspect is sustainability, which we are pursuing with this approach.
This is not a one-off campaign; as some of the rapporteurs have already said, this is a process which is both deep and far-reaching and is being pursued consistently.
All the initiatives tabled which have not been adopted by the legislature will be regularly reviewed and, if necessary, withdrawn.
One such review is currently taking place with a view to the work programme for 2008.
Our simplification programme will be continued in 2007 and 2008 as well and we will be unveiling a range of new initiatives here.
The outcome will be progressive coverage of all the European Union's areas of legislation.
We are deploying all the methods at our disposal, as outlined and supported by Mr Gargani in his report.
Half of the initiatives envisaged in the simplification programme have already been successfully completed, and we will pursue this work intensively until 2009.
This will lead to direct and tangible benefits for companies, public authorities and individuals.
Our goal is to achieve a situation in which our legislation is, in every case, clear, comprehensible and user-friendly and also takes account of technological progress.
For the purposes of quality control and impact assessment, we have set up the Impact Assessment Board, which operates independently of the relevant Commission services and is already making a very positive contribution.
I am most grateful to Mrs Lévai for pledging her full support for this body in her report.
However, I would also like to make it very clear to you that we are committed to reviewing this system next year and that we will take appropriate steps, as required, based on the findings of this review.
I would like to emphasise that in light of the important points raised by Mr Doorn.
One of the major priorities this year is reducing the administrative burdens arising for companies as a result of EU rules.
To that end, we have already unveiled 10 'fast track actions', and thanks to the European Parliament's prompt support, two of them have already been implemented successfully.
Further proposals will follow.
We are now in the process of implementing comprehensive monitoring of the current burdens; this monitoring is taking place in 10 major economic sectors, which in practice covers around 85% of Europe's entire economy.
This is to enable us to identify the reduction potential.
The target - as has already been stated - is to reduce these costs by 25% by the year 2012.
I fully endorse what Mr Doorn has said.
Of course it is important to ensure that having reduced burdens in one area, new legislation does not create other burdens elsewhere.
That is a very important point and I am most grateful to Parliament for drawing attention to it.
I hope that the Member States will set equally ambitious goals before the end of this year, for this project can only be successful if it is pursued jointly at European and national level.
Naturally, stakeholder groups have an important role to play in this project, and we need their support.
That is why a high-level independent panel of experts will be established, representing small and medium-sized enterprises, consumers and environmental organisations, whose role is to advise the Commission on potential reduction measures.
The Commission is extremely grateful, as I am, to the European Parliament for its broad support, expressed in the reports we are debating today.
The Commission is especially pleased that Mrs Lévai's report urges the Council and Parliament to undertake systematic impact assessments of proposed amendments having potential significant impacts.
We had already agreed on this in November 2005 in common interinstitutional approaches.
The Commission would also ask the Council and Parliament to endorse the proposal made by Mr Doorn and further adapt their working methods so that certain tasks relating to the simplification of legislation can be carried out swiftly.
It does not help us, after all, if projects remain in the pipeline.
In relation to the various instruments summarised as soft law in Mr Medina Ortega's report, the Commission wishes to emphasise that classic legislation is not always the most appropriate solution.
I would like to underline the principle yet again: laws should only be adopted where absolutely necessary.
We have other instruments whose application is clearly regulated by the Community Treaties, as well as those which serve solely to pave the way for future legislation.
On behalf of the entire Commission, I truly can promise you that in all the instruments that we are applying, we completely respect the rights of Parliament and will keep Parliament fully informed in the interests of mutual respect between our institutions.
Let me conclude by reiterating what President Barroso stated, in this House last April, to be the basic principle.
European legislation is indeed the unique and defining feature of the European Union, for we are a legal community.
European integration is based on the law.
Only the law can guarantee the freedoms that Europeans enjoy today, and only the law can provide the economy with dependable and fair parameters.
The citizens of Europe have a right to expect not just better legislation but the best legislation that is humanly possible.

In the EU alone, an estimated 9.3 million tonnes of electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) are sold annually, the biggest share of which are large household appliances and IT and telecommunication equipment.
As the market continues to grow and innovation cycles become increasingly shorter, the replacement of equipment accelerates, making waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) the fastest growing waste stream.
The volume of WEEE items is estimated to grow to 12.3 million tonnes by 2020.
The key aspects of this recast of the directive are as follows:
open scope
differentiation between RoHS and REACH
modification of the exemption criteria
criteria for deciding on the duration of exemption/grace periods
codecision for future restrictions instead of comitology
specific provisions on nanomaterials.
I welcome that agreement was reached on first reading.
I voted for this report as the new proposal for a directive is simpler and will offer manufacturers an easier instrument to use for classifying their products in the categories envisaged by the directive.
It also takes into account the socio-economic impact linked to the protection of health and the environment when amending the exception criteria.
<D>
(PL) Mr President, the aims of the Lisbon Strategy were defined eight years ago.
The Lisbon Strategy's priority was to ensure that Europe developed at a faster rate than the United States, whilst also increasing sustainable employment.
Failure on both counts has been officially recorded.
There is clear lack of cohesion between the Lisbon Strategy and actual implementation of the common agricultural policy, for example.
One instance of this is the reform of the market in sugar.
In many cases, the European Commission has been pressing ahead with the reforms without considering the relevant social context.
By way of example I should like to refer to the case of the sugar factory at Lublin in Poland.
Contrary even to Union provisions, it is planned to make the entire staff of that factory redundant, to knock down all the buildings and to put modern facilities beyond use.
It is also planned to deprive growers in the entire region of their livelihood.
A one-off compensation payment will not resolve the employment problem.
Such actions run counter to the stated aims of the Lisbon Strategy.
Ridiculous measures of this sort certainly do not bring us closer to achieving the aims of that Strategy.
<D>
Mr President, the EU has a 70% deficit in cotton.
The sector should therefore receive more aid.
This would also help to develop the whole industry, from growing cotton to manufacturing fabric and clothing.
Instead of this, what with quotas and co-responsibility levies, production, agricultural income and jobs are in decline.
Since the last CAP reform, the consequences of this decline have been felt more acutely, owing to the introduction of partial decoupling from the volume of production at 65%.
In Greece, a year after implementation of the new Common Market Organisation (CMO) in cotton, production is down by 20%, and in Spain by more than 50%.
In Greece 11% of small- and medium-sized agricultural holdings have disappeared; the figure is 25% in Spain.
A fair number of ginning plants are unviable and about to close down, and many jobs have been lost.
The increase in production costs should have been matched by an increase in aid, which instead has been reduced.
Despite the positive proposals it contains, Mr Gklavakis's recommendation does not solve the problem; it accepts the Commission's proposal.
We disagree with reducing the quota in Greece in order to increase the coupled aid per hectare.
This will cause yet more small and medium cotton-growers to disappear.
Nobody else can count on finding a definite solution to their problems.
<D>
in writing. - There are many cases in which family members of human rights defenders (spouses, children, parents) face human rights violations themselves, including killings, death threats, abductions and kidnappings, arbitrary arrest, defamation, job loss, and other actions of harassment and intimidation.
These actions generate a climate of terror within their community, and impede on their legitimate work.
Support for their families must go beyond the delivery of visas in emergency situations.
Neither the short-term nor the long-term needs of their families have been sufficiently addressed.
Sometimes, the price paid by human rights defenders is very high.
Detention, sometimes murder, causes pain and survival problems for them and their families.
We have the duty to help them.
EU policies and instruments should substantially address the hardship placed on these families in their own countries.
Effective strategies should offer real support and assist these families in finding solutions to their problems, providing effective remedies, including moral support, shelter, help with their reintegration into society, job search and emergency funds.
This approach will discourage the cruel measures imposed on families in order to prevent defenders from continuing their work and improve the efficiency of the human rights campaigns.
<D>
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, 'Russia is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma,' Churchill once said.
The European Union has agreed on what it wants from Russia.
The question is, how fast?
Energy politics turns Germany blind to Polish and Lithuanian demands.
Nord Stream, Depal - it looks like all pipelines from Russia lead over the heads of central European countries.
This is not a pipe dream, as the perestroika guy, Gorbachev, said.
The Economist admits that the Baltic pipe was conceived in secret.
Lithuanian demands for firmer terms concerning energy seem, therefore, relevant.
Many Eurocrats fumed about that to strengthen the view of neurotic post-Communist countries.
On the other hand, Germany's economy minister threatens that his country will not let the EU Commission dictate decisions in the backrooms in Brussels.
He definitely did not mean human rights, I guess.
The initiative of the 'Eastern Partnership' launched by Poland and Sweden may be spectacular.
Bravery is good, but brains are better.
The partnership between the EU and Russia is uneasy.
It will not be successful without Poland, which is Russia's natural neighbour by land, water and air.
It is something that all sides obviously need to take into consideration, especially today when the Treaty of Lisbon was pulled down and its falling bricks may damage whatever stands in its way.
Good resolutions are useless attempts if they interfere with sovereign nations.
'Perhaps there is a key to Russia.
That key is Russian national interest,' Churchill added.
The opinion that 'nothing is impossible in Russia but reform' seems to be no longer true.
Whatever the approach, the EU needs to cooperate with Russia, and vice versa.
<D>
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, eight years ago the Commission published a report, provided for in the 1994 directive on European Works Councils, in which it recognised that the application of this text in some cases seems - I quote - 'to guarantee only a very low level of transnational consultation and information'.
It concluded, and I quote again, that it would, 'at the given moment decide on the possible revision of the Directive'.
That was eight years ago.
Four years passed and nothing happened.
In 2004 the Commission finally launched the first phase of consultation with the social partners.
Then another four years were lost, even though the position of all sides was well known and had not changed.
According to employers' organisations, any revision of the directive is pointless, while the trade unions believe that it is vital.
I should add that the Commission itself acknowledged that in 2006, only one third of companies had set up such a Council, that 20% of the European Works Councils that did exist were only consulted after the public announcement of management decisions and that 30% were not consulted at all.
During this time, there was an explosion in the number of mergers, restructurings and relocations.
Finally today we are coming out of this unjustifiable hibernation.
Some proposals are on the table.
They are indeed so timid that BusinessEurope, which was against the revision, is delighted that they are, in its words, less prescriptive than inspirational, but at least the debate can begin.
The ball is now in Parliament's court, and Parliament does not have to start from scratch.
I should recall that in 2001, our PPE fellow Member at the time, Mr Menrad, had a report adopted on the subject.
It mentioned, among other requirements for the enforcement of the directive, - I quote - 'adequate sanctions at national and European level for non-compliance with the Directive' - specific and heavy sanctions -, the right to suspend the management's decision at the request of employees' representatives, and a more prominent role for the trade unions.
Our Group will support taking up the proposals in the old PPE report, which gained a majority in 2001, and suggests being more specific about them, in particular on two points.
Firstly, the European Works Councils must have access to strategic information about the group so that consultation is not merely a formality, and above all they must have the right to suspend any restructuring plan: not just to push back the deadline, but so they can carry out a counter-assessment, present counter-proposals and participate in real negotiations.
We only have a little time.
The end of this parliamentary term is approaching.
I think the moment of truth has come.
<D>
(RO) European Schools are recognised in Europe as elite institutions that provide quality education to young people.
In 1953, Jean Monnet said that the purpose of these schools was to bring together European children, irrespective of their nationality, and to instill in them the European spirit and sense of belonging, so that they may eventually create a united and prosperous Europe.
The reform programme of these schools must take into account the following important issues.
All of the 23 official languages of the European Union must exist within these schools, and children must be given the opportunity to speak their native language.
Unfortunately, there are still some official EU languages which are not spoken in any of the European Schools.
Furthermore, one of the objectives of European Schools is to foster unity within groups of children, to bring them together and to facilitate the development of a spirit of tolerance and communication among them.
Therefore, I believe that dividing them into three categories is not a sound measure.
Those falling into the last category, 'others', as it is called, get the opportunity to attend such a school only if there are places left after the children of European officials have been admitted.
This categorisation is discriminatory and I suggest that it should be removed from the statute of European Schools.
<D>
in writing. - (PL) I welcome the fact that the European Parliament has adopted a new directive on the production and use of pesticides.
The directive tightens up the conditions under which trade in the chemical substances used in the manufacture of plant protection products may be permitted.
The outcome will be beneficial to the citizens of the European Union, especially as regards their life and health.
In addition, the directive details the cases in which spraying from the air may take place.
It also recommends lowering the amount of pesticides used and prioritising non-chemical alternatives.
The report by Mrs Belohorská is worthy of support, if only because of the very wide but also up-to-date scope of the provisions.
There can be no doubt that European Union citizens no longer wish to have daily contact with toxins, and do not wish to consume contaminated products.
Our citizens do not wish either to be affected by carcinogenic or toxic substances, or by substances with endocrine-disrupting properties.
In response to these clear expectations expressed by European society, it was appropriate also to support a ban on the use of pesticides in rural and urban public areas.
The use of pesticides in areas surrounding hospices, sanatoria, rehabilitation centres, clinics and hospitals should be banned.
Such a ban should also extend to parks, public gardens, sports and leisure areas, school grounds, children's playgrounds and similar locations.
<D>
Madam President, I have two points to make, the first on the procedure, the second on the voting list.
On the voting list: firstly, there was no mention of paragraph 3; secondly, I think we should look again at what happened about Amendments 52 and 51.
If you look at it, 51 is clearly the nearest to the original text and should have been voted first.
52 is furthest away and should have been voted second.
I would ask that the Presidency look at this because that is clearly what should have happened.
So, on those procedural points, I would like some answers.
Secondly, on the politics of it, this was the first real vote on climate change.
It was not a piece of legislation - that will come - but, by failing to support the 2012 date backed by the European Commission, I think that the ALDE Group and the PPE-DE Group in this House failed the first test on climate change and the people out there will be looking at what happened here today and wondering whether we really are serious about the commitments we made back in March to reduce CO2.
We talk about Europe being a Europe of the environment.
We have to do it in legislation if it is ever going to happen.
<D>
(SK) Thank you, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today our sitting closes one of the most important EU presidencies of the last decade.
It has not been a typical six months in politics, with the presiding country striving to coordinate the EU Member States.
Following the highly successful German Presidency, which succeeded in concluding the period of reflection on the Constitution, the Portuguese Presidency successfully oversaw the signing of the so-called Lisbon Treaty.
As in the past, when Portugal entered the history books as a founder and discoverer of a new land, European modern history will remember Portugal as the founder of a new history within the framework of the European Union.
I believe that the position of the European Parliament will, in the context of this agreement, have a far greater importance than it has had to date.
Besides this fundamental document, the Portuguese Presidency is also to be commended for the European Union-Brazil summit as well as for the recently concluded European Union-Africa summit.
Both of these summits have laid solid foundations for the activities of the countries that will hold the presidency in the future and for increasing the influence of the European Union in those parts of the world.
Mr President, I would like to thank you for your endeavours and wish you a happy Christmas.
<D>
- Mr President, yesterday in my home city of Birmingham we held a car crisis summit.
I was sorry I was unable to be there because I started work in the automotive industry 40 years ago.
I have been through many crises, but nothing like this.
There has never been a situation where sales have collapsed so quickly.
I want to say to my Green colleagues that if they go and look at the unsold cars they will find that the smaller, lighter, greener models are of a higher proportion sitting out there.
This is not a failure of business models: it is a failure of the whole economic system.
One of the statistics from our summit - from Professor David Bailey in our Birmingham Business School - estimates that 300 000 consumers in the United Kingdom were refused a car credit application over the last six months.
Now some of them would probably have been refused any way, but that is the nature of what we are facing.
As regards some of the things we have talked about - and I agree entirely with what Stephen Hughes said about Nissan, and he knows them very well - we can do things at a national and a European level to help the industry through this restructuring.
It is much better to help the industry keep those core people on the payroll and retrain them than to let them go and then to hire them back again later.
We have the incentives to invest in those new cars that Ms Harms and others want.
The fact that the Greens are talking about electric cars as being a solution shows simply how out of touch they are with the real world - those are 10 or more years away, and we all know that.
The problem is actually getting buyers and demand back into the economy.
We need to tackle credit; we need to help public buyers back into the market to buy the green buses, the green trucks, the green cars - after all, there will be things following through there.
We do not want a competitive race between businesses.
Mr Vondra was absolutely clear that this is a single market, and we do not want competitive activities there.
But, above all, we need to face up to the fact that the car dealers have to be out there selling and looking after cars.
My final point is to you, Commissioner, and you talked about Ms Kroes working on this earlier: please tell Ms Kroes to take off the table this entirely unwanted and destabilising proposal to change the whole structure of dealer contracts.
Nobody has asked for it, and we do not want it.
<D>
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the trend in energy prices is throttling the economy and eroding the purchasing power of families, who are seeing energy bills rise relentlessly.
In this new context the link between energy prices and foreign policy, and hence the increased political clout of producer countries, is obvious.
Clearly, Europe must pursue a short strategy based on speeding up the use of renewable energy sources, the promotion of and search for new methods of exploiting natural, clean energy, and the building of new pipelines.
Therefore it is also necessary to increase our oil and gas reserves.
All of this is not enough; new initiatives are required.
I would emphasise the two proposals made by Prime Minister Berlusconi in recent weeks: a coming-together of all energy-purchasing countries and hence the setting of a maximum price; and the launch of a major plan for nuclear power stations.
Can the Commission respond to these two proposals, Commissioner?
Furthermore, when elucidating its strategies for mapping out a different future in terms of supplies, can you tell us whether - as far as you know - financial speculation is taking place, and what the Commission intends to do about it?
<D>
Every year hundreds of millions of animals - pigs, cows, sheep, hens, horses and other animals - are slaughtered and transported throughout Europe.
In addition to that, 25 million fur-bearing animals are slaughtered.
This involves an enormous amount of suffering for the animals.
Of course, the best solution would be for us not to eat them at all and for us not to wear animals in the form of furs.
However, this regulation is not really about that, but about how we can reduce the suffering of animals at slaughterhouses.
The Commission's proposal is a step forward, but it must be made more stringent on a number of points.
In the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety we voted through my opinion, in which we demand, among other things, shorter transport times and waiting times at slaughterhouses, investments in mobile slaughterhouses, that fur-bearing animals be included under this regulation, that Member States be able to go further and have more stringent provisions and that animal welfare inspectors and the proposed national reference centres for animal welfare be independent and be given greater powers.
It is gratifying that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development supports our proposal on mobile slaughterhouses and to include fur-bearing animals.
However, I am deeply concerned about several other amendments put forward by this committee and by individual Members.
It is unfortunate that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has completely deleted the proposed time limits for transport to the slaughterhouse and the waiting time inside the slaughterhouse.
Please vote in favour of Amendment 125 put forward by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left so that we regain these requirements.
I also do not understand why the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development wants to delete the proposal on national reference centres for animal welfare.
It is also incredibly important to allow Member States to go further and have more ambitious provisions than those laid down here.
I urge you to vote in favour of Amendment 124.
Finally, I am deeply concerned about the fact that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development does not want to allow the Member States which currently have a complete ban on slaughter without stunning to retain that ban.
This is the case, for example, in my country, Sweden.
We have found a balance between religious tradition and animal welfare that most people are happy with.
Please vote against Amendment 28, as proposed by the rapporteur.
<D>
Mr President, thank you for your kind words.
Obviously I return the compliment in terms of commitment to Europe, and to the Vice-President of the Commission, Jacques Barrot.
Mr Coelho, ladies and gentlemen, redesigning the Schengen system is necessary to develop the new functions that crime prevention and border control will demand in future.
The 'SISone4ALL' system, Minister, developed on the initiative of the Portuguese Presidency, is a happy compromise that allowed the Member States that joined in 2004 to be included and, more importantly, led to the removal of controls at internal land borders, in December, and then at air borders, in March.
We all felt emotional seeing the last iron curtain come down, seeing Slovak and Austrian ministers symbolically cut down the wooden barrier at the Berg-Petržalka crossing point to the east of Vienna.
I think that this is a proud moment for any staunch European supporter, knowing that we have an area of free movement of 3.6 million km2.
This is the largest area in the world, although - as you know - the necessary corollary of this great freedom is an electronic system that allows us to identify suspected criminals and to follow the trail of false papers and stolen passports, while applying stringent data protection rules to guarantee individual freedoms.
I would like to emphasise this point.
However, as you quite rightly said, the current system does not allow the use of modern technology, even if this complies with the fundamental principles of data protection and especially the principle of proportionality.
How can the police be efficient with a central database that does not currently allow them to look at digital photographs of wanted criminals, to identify them with any certainty?
This is why the aim of the Schengen II or SIS II information system must be maintained; as you clearly explained, this is the real issue in our debate.
Mr President, on behalf of the Council, I would like to thank the Vice-President, Mr Barrot, who, under a new mandate, has agreed to continue overseeing the development of the new SIS central database, in addition to the connection with national databases.
I would like to thank him for being personally involved in this project.
The draft texts that you will be asked to vote on tomorrow set out a clearer division of responsibilities between the Member States and the Commission during each phase, whether in terms of project development, final tests, the interim phase, with the converter, or the final migration of one system to another, in the interests of establishing an overall balance between the obligations of Member States and the responsibilities of the European Commission.
I would particularly like to thank Mr Coelho, who has worked swiftly, effectively and imaginatively on this important project, together with his colleagues from the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs.
I would also ask him to pass on my thanks to the committee chairman, Mr Deprez.
Mr Coelho has encouraged support for the texts needed for today's plenary, and these texts incorporate the proposals that you made, Mr Coelho.
Parliament's support today allows us to embark on a new phase in the transition to SIS II, in time for the expiry of the Commission's current mandate - an ad hoc mandate, I should point out - which is due to expire on 31 December.
I would just like to reassure the Vice-President on this point.
Of course, the launch of the new system represents an enormous technological challenge, and one that was no doubt underestimated at first.
In fact, the transfer of 22 million records involving more than 24 parties whose national databases are in different formats is, as you can imagine, no mean feat.
However, the efforts that have been made in this project are, I think, up to the task.
In view of these technical and financial efforts, the European Parliament deserves to be kept fully informed of the progress and of the difficulties that exist in the transition to the new system.
A deadline should be set - as you said, Mr Coelho - to test the new system and check that it will be fully operational - as we all hope - in September next year, as agreed during the Justice and Home Affairs Council Meeting on 6 June.
We realise that we have set ourselves a tight deadline.
The technical experts realise this.
We can only meet this deadline if everyone is wholeheartedly committed to the SIS II project and shoulders their responsibilities.
With this report, the European Parliament is sending out a positive signal this evening by asking perfectly legitimate questions.
This is why the Council proposes to unconditionally approve the amendments tabled, which, I should point out, have received the support of all political groups within the European Parliament.
Thank you so much for all your hard work.
<D>
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to thank you, Commissioner Ashton, for your words, which we certainly should remember for a long time.
A few weeks ago, I attended the most recent regional ACP summit in Guyana.
The predominant opinion amongst my colleagues from the Caribbean States was that the time has come to look to the future, to stop crying over spilt milk and to single-mindedly implement the Economic Partnership Agreements.
In order to ensure successful implementation of these agreements, it is vital for the parliaments to control the process by means of their parliamentary scrutiny.
It is only if the parliaments are able to verify whether the new system of regulations can achieve what it was designed to do, that the Economic Partnership Agreements can operate as a driving force for development.
It is only when the parliaments take on this supervisory function that we can ensure that financial aid reaches the areas where it is needed.
This applies to the national parliaments of the Caribbean as much as it does to the European Parliament.
In all of the resolutions before us concerning the Economic Partnership Agreements, there are paragraphs which address the issue of parliamentary control.
However, these references are not consistent.
The text contained in the SADC-EPA Resolution presents a good compromise.
It ensures that the European Parliament's Committee on International Trade and the Committee on Development, as well as the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Committee are involved in the process.
As I view this compromise as a success, I have, together with my colleague Mr Sturdy, tabled a number of amendments, which aim to standardise these paragraphs in all of the EPA Resolutions.
I would very much like your support for this initiative.
<D>
(PL) Mr President, the proposed changes to the milk market and the creation of a milk fund are meant to provide support to farmers and consumers, not to damage the existing situation.
There is no doubt that provision must be made for exceptional circumstances and a legal basis guaranteed for the storage of milk products in different conditions.
A particularly important part of the battle for healthy food is to provide support for agricultural production in mountainous areas.
Good quality milk is produced there because of the relatively low levels of pollution.
It is equally important to give the public accurate information about the product, i.e. milk, as well as about the country and producer responsible for its manufacture.
This should include information that genetically modified plants were or were not used during its production.
This is particularly important when giving milk to children.
Finally I would like to congratulate Mrs Jeggle on her excellent report.
<D>
(SV) Mr President, migration has taken place throughout human history.
It has been one of the most fundamental driving forces of that history.
When we speak of migration between countries, we are therefore addressing quite fundamental questions, existential questions of human freedom.
Do people not have the right to choose where in the world they want to live?
None of this is actually up for discussion here.
The modern welfare state is irreconcilable with free immigration and hard to reconcile with more extensive migration in general because of different standards of living.
Immigration as a means of rejuvenating our own populations is practically dead in the water according to research.
Immigration by family members has very minor effects on the demographic structure.
It would require 50-70% of all the people in a country to be immigrants if we were to rejuvenate the population of a country such as Japan.
Brain drain is a major problem for many developing countries.
Here it is effectively proposed that we should rob other countries of their educated populations.
A new approach is needed.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak again.
I would like to thank Mr Bösch, not only for his praise of our rapporteur, but also for his fairness and help.
Mr Bösch has been dealing with the fraud report for many years.
Now we have this honour, and I think it is a great sign of strength in the Committee on Budgetary Control that we are in agreement here.
We have focused our full attention on the Member States.
The Commission should also take with it the message that we want to help to bring this lack of clarity to an end.
If we look at the figures on the recovery of funds, we see that we are dealing with a very wide range of opinions.
That is why we are having this discussion as part of the current discharge procedure.
Consequently, I really must ask the Commission to have the courage to say if it does not know certain things, so that we can help.
I think that if we tackle the issue together, then together, we will be successful.
Once again, very many thanks to Mr Bösch.
<D>
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (NL) Madam President, I advocate a total ban on the import of seal fur skins.
Each year, a magnificent spectacle of nature becomes the setting for a bloody, gruesome display of pain and suffering, with baby seals as young as 12 days' old clubbed to death or shot down.
This slaughter is carried out for the benefit of the market and of big business, without any store being set by animal welfare, and this really fills me with horror.
We cannot want to import this abomination into the EU.
Indeed, many EU citizens do not, and they support a total ban on the import of seal fur skins.
In the Netherlands, we have fought hard for such a ban, and have succeeded.
Adopting the Commission proposal in its original form would undermine the result achieved in the Netherlands.
However, Parliament's report leads me to conclude that this House has reached the point of accepting a total ban on seal fur skins.
I support such a ban, and I call on all the Members of this House, and also the Commission, to follow suit.
<D>
Mr President, let me put this straight.
I am committed to fighting terrorism and to ensuring security for all citizens, but I am not going to explain to my constituents how 11 MEPs decided, in an obscure bureaucratic procedure, to allow body-scanning in European airports which would show them naked.
This whole comitology procedure is yet another example of how to push European citizens into Euro-scepticism.
The Commission's argument - but also that of the developers of this technology - is that body scanners are intended as alternative to physical searches.
But the moment we allow this technology, we will have no guarantee that it will not be used for primary screening.
We all know from our experience in airports that some of them perform a mandatory physical search.
Therefore the issue is whether we allow body scanners or not.
Perhaps we should forbid them.
So I urge the Commission to suspend this procedure, which has put us in a messy situation.
We need to have a large democratic debate in which Parliament and the EDPS have to be involved.
This is invasive technology, and issues such as privacy, proportionality and efficiency must be carefully looked into.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - (EL) Madam President, it is a top priority for the Commission to conclude a far-reaching international agreement on climate change, covering the period after 2012.
The Bali Conference was a significant step in the effort to confront climate change at world level.
All the parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, including the United States, China and India, agreed to begin formal negotiations.
What we need now - as it is a key priority for the EU and the Commission - is an agreement by the end of 2009 on a future international legal framework on climate.
This framework must be generally applicable; it must ensure that all parties are committed participants, and it must be effective.
To achieve the desired result, which is, as we have said, an international agreement, the EU really must continue to play a leading role, as it certainly did up to and of course during the Bali Conference.
This is precisely the significance of the package of proposals on climate and renewable sources of energy, which the Commission submitted on 23 January.
The EU must retain its leading role and clearly show determination to proceed.
The EU emission allowance trading system is our basic means of channelling investments towards cleaner technologies.
This system ensures that the greenhouse gas targets set by the EU can be achieved at the lowest possible cost.
The EU proposal for a revised directive on the trading system envisages auctioning as the main method of distributing allowances.
Auctioning not only provides incentives for investments in low carbon emission technologies; it also prevents the undesirable consequences of unfair allocation and unjustifiable profits.
For this reason, the Commission proposes that, from the start of the third trading period, allowances should no longer be allocated free of charge to power-generating companies, and in the industrial sector, free allocation will be progressively curtailed with a target of complete abolition in 2020.
Some energy-intensive sectors or industries operate in a fiercely competitive international market.
As a result, they cannot pass on the cost to the consumer without the risk of losing a large part of the market.
If there is no international agreement, they risk relocating outside Europe, with the result that worldwide greenhouse gas emissions (carbon leakage) will increase.
The sectors where this risk of carbon leakage plays a part must be specified objectively.
The Commission therefore proposes that this question should be examined thoroughly and that a list of vulnerable sectors or industries be drawn up by 2010.
By June 2011 the Commission will assess the situation in these energy-intensive industries.
It will base its assessment on the outcome of negotiations for the international agreement on climate change or on any individual sector agreements that may have been concluded.
On the basis of this assessment, the Commission will submit a report to the European Parliament and the Council in 2011 and, if deemed necessary, will propose additional measures.
These measures will include free allocation of greenhouse gas emission allowances to energy-intensive sectors, up to 100%.
The Commission's proposal includes, as a further measure, the establishment of an effective carbon equalising or offsetting mechanism.
The aim is that the Community industrial installations that run a significant risk of carbon leakage should be placed on a comparable, equal footing with those in third countries.
Under such an equalising system, provision could also be made for imposing terms on importers, comparable with the terms applying to installations within the EU, for example, the obligation to return CO2 emission allowances.
Whatever method is agreed and whatever action is undertaken, it must be in full conformity with the principles of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.
This is especially true of the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and capabilities in the special case of less developed countries.
It must also be in conformity with the Community's international obligations, including Word Trade Organisation rules.
To conclude, the proposal on climate and energy has been collectively approved by the European Commission as a whole, and is therefore supported by all its members.
<D>
- (FR) Madam President, Europe's credibility is at stake with regard to the energy issue.
Thank you, Mr Barroso, for your very clear words this morning.
These Gazprom and Naftogaz companies, this performance that we have been seeing for two, three, four, five days now, it is unbelievable!
From now on, we have to say: 'Gentlemen, enough is enough!'
To do that, we have to act together.
Thank you for the good coordination!
Can someone here explain to me what these visits to Moscow by the Slovakian and the Bulgarian Prime Ministers are all about?
This already shows Gazprom that we are not united.
Explain these two visits to me.
Moving on, I believe that the Commission has a major role to play: we need to establish emergency gas plans.
The first thing to do is to recast the Gas Security Directive, otherwise the European Commission will not have enough political power to act.
European coordination is required.
Secondly, we need an emergency 'Central and Eastern Europe gas infrastructure' plan, with the money that is available.
Thirdly, we need to combine Europe's economic recovery with a major energy investment plan.
The main priority is the buildings in Eastern Europe.
It is scandalous to see such a small proportion of the Structural Funds being invested in something useful!
Rather than having stadiums built for European championships, I would prefer money to be invested for our citizens - in buildings, heating networks and renewable energies.
My final remark is that we are more dependent when it comes to nuclear energy than we are with respect to gas.
We import 99% of our nuclear fuels!
Stop linking nuclear energy to independence!
Mrs Koch-Mehrin, you sound ridiculous when you mention that.

on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (SV) Madam President, in the debate on the recall of the toys in question it has often been said that responsibility for the fact that dangerous toys are on the market rests with the country of manufacture, in this case China.
I regret that the discussion has not focused more on the responsibility borne by the firms which outsource production to countries such as China, in this case Mattel.
I do not want to single out this particular company for criticism since a great many firms outsource production.
They do so because they want to keep prices as low as possible.
They want to increase profits.
But we must devote much more discussion to the responsibility incumbent on such companies.
They endeavour to keep costs as low as possible while at the same time taking no responsibility either for consumer safety or for the employees who work with these dangerous products.
We must put pressure on companies to make them understand that as consumers we demand safe products that we can trust.
We also demand that products be manufactured in decent working conditions without risks to the health and safety of employees.
It is of course especially tragic when it is children who are hurt by dangerous products.
Clearly we must join together to ensure that this is stopped.
<D>
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, let us be honest.
The EU satellite radio navigation programmes are an unmitigated disaster.
The private sector has been quick to spot the pig in a poke and has shown Galileo a clean pair of heels.
But is the EU prepared to accept the obvious and abandon the project?
No, far from it.
Instead, we have this report, which advocates not only that the project should go charging ahead, but that the European taxpayer should pick up the entire cost.
It asks for, in this case, a massive increase in the budget, from GBP 120 million to GBP 715 million.
In other words, we are seeing the beginning of an open-cheque-book situation for this shameful project.
The United States has its own satellite system, GPS, and therefore the EU must have one as well; this is the guiding principle behind Galileo.
It is kindergarten policy-making which defies common sense, has no credible economic justification and is morally and environmentally corrupt.
This institution spends a great deal of time discussing the environment and bringing forward hair-shirt measures designed to force people living in Europe into a kind of permanent guilt-ridden existence over their carbon footprint.
Yet here we are pushing forward a project whose impact on the environment will be almost beyond calculation.
Has anyone stopped to consider the carbon footprint of launching into orbit the 30 satellites required by the Galileo system, which will require the burning of massive amounts of rocket engine propellant?
The EU's environmental credentials are already highly questionable, because of the depredations of the CFP and the CAP, not to mention the unnecessary provisions of Parliament's two buildings, here and in Brussels.
I call upon all Members here today, especially those who see themselves as environmental warriors, to examine their conscience and to oppose this colossal white elephant.
We do not need to duplicate facilities already available from the American GPS, and we certainly should not inflict so much unnecessary carbon pollutant upon this environment.
<D>
in writing. - (PL) Mr President, preparations for the EU's December summit in Brussels are taking place in a better atmosphere than was expected.
That is obviously due to the approval of the Reform Treaty and the prospect of its untroubled adoption in Lisbon.
The compromise reached in Poland -which consisted in maintaining the previous government's line on the Charter of Fundamental Rights so as not to endanger the whole treaty - has played its part.
It must be stressed, however, that the atmosphere created around the new treaty has exaggeratedly linked its adoption or non-adoption with the European Union's chances of survival.
Following enlargement in 2004 and the admission of Bulgaria and Romania - i.e. with 27 Member States - the Union functioned on the basis of the Treaty of Nice.
That it was functioning effectively was proved by the adoption of the Financial Perspective for 2007-13.
Admittedly, it was adopted with some difficulty, but agreement was reached about money, which seems to be the most difficult issue and is therefore a test of the usefulness of the existing institutional rules.
Despite this and other agreements, an impression of crisis in the EU was created artificially.
That in turn had repercussions in terms of the declining confidence of citizens in the European institutions and the advisability of further enlargement.
This dangerous spiral, halted to some extent in the second half of 2007, should serve as a lesson and a warning for the future.
<D>
- Mr President, I thank the Commissioner very much indeed for his opening statement.
What everyone is asking about is legal certainty.
I have a couple of questions based on that and also one on the Treaty of Lisbon, should it be ratified.
As a good Conservative Euro-sceptic, I should say that I hope it never is.
But I was just wondering, what will this mean - if it is ratified - for sporting organisations and governing bodies?
Many of these governing bodies believe that it will recognise concretely their specificity, the specificity of sport.
So, Commissioner, could you tell us how this recognition in the new Treaty will help sport?
Will sport then get derogations from different aspects, like employment law or other laws, that they actually want to try and achieve?
On legal certainty, there are so many questions that the Commission should and could be helping sporting organisations with now.
Should companies from overseas be investing huge amounts of money into sporting clubs within Europe?
I have no problem with this.
I actually see it as direct inward investment and, therefore, a very positive thing.
But sporting organisations and many governing bodies think this is a bad thing.
So, what is your interpretation of a sporting organisation banning such a practice?
As my colleague, Mr Belet, said, UEFA is currently proposing to ban transfers of under-18s across borders.
European law recognises a worker as someone essentially with the minimum age of 16, so what happens when a 17-year old challenges the fact that he was not able to move to a big club in a country that was not his own, in the current situation that we find ourselves in?
Home-grown players; 'six plus five' with FIFA: what is the clarification of those two points?
Also, football is always very interested in these subjects and it seems to drive the agenda.
However, all of these matters actually affect polo and rugby union and table tennis players - all sports are affected.
Are we looking at a wider range of sports?
Will the Commission actually open up a forum where sport can come and talk to the Commission openly about some of the problems it has and get some of these questions answered on a regular basis - no matter with the Treaty of Lisbon or without?
<D>
Τhe final version of the draft agenda, as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its last meeting pursuant to Rules 140 and 155 of the Rules of Procedure, has been distributed.
In agreement with the political groups, I propose the following amendments to the agenda for this week's plenary:
Wednesday, 5 May 2010:
Firstly, the joint debate on the two reports by Íñigo Méndez de Vigo on the composition of Parliament will be the first item.
Secondly, a new item entitled 'Council and Commission statements on preparation of the Summit of Heads of State or Government of the euro area (7 May 2010)', with no vote, has been added to the agenda.
This item will be the second item and there will be just one round of speakers from the political groups and no 'catch-the-eye' procedure.
Thirdly, the title 'Council and Commission statements on the standardisation of electric cars' has been amended to 'Council and Commission statements on electric cars'.
Fourthly, the report by Vittorio Prodi, a brief presentation of which was scheduled for today, has been moved to Question Time on Thursday, 6 May 2010, for an immediate vote.
Thursday, 6 May 2010:
Firstly, the vote on the report by Vital Moreira on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council providing macro-economic financial assistance to Ukraine has been postponed to the second part-session in May.
Secondly, the vote on the motion for a resolution on the draft Commission regulation on guidelines for setting up a compensatory mechanism between transmission system managers and on a common approach to the electricity transmission prices has been withdrawn from the agenda.
Are there any comments?
(Parliament approved the amendments)
(The order of business was adopted thus amended)

Vice-President of the Commission. - The Commission has strongly condemned the violence in Gaza.
This crisis proves once more that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict does not have a military solution.
Only negotiations with the full commitment of the parties can bring about a lasting solution.
The Commission welcomes the recent cessation of hostilities in Gaza.
It is vital that all parties make the current ceasefire permanent through the full implementation of UN Security Council resolution 1860.
A number of issues need to be addressed without delay, in particular, the reopening of all crossings into and out of Gaza, a sustained halt to rocket attacks against Israel and an effective means to prevent arms-smuggling to Gaza.
Now that the hostilities appear to have stopped, it will be important to resume talks aimed at comprehensive peace as soon as possible.
The EU has called on its partners for help in driving the peace process forward.
The immediate priority for the Commission is to alleviate the humanitarian suffering of the population in Gaza.
Trading relations between the EU and Israel will continue.
Isolation, sanctions or any other forms of boycott would be harmful to talks and negotiations aimed at achieving a sustainable solution to the conflict.
Furthermore, while targeting Israeli interests, they would also prove to be detrimental to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, which is economically dependent on Israel as a main destination for its exports and employment of its labour force.
<D>
author. - (NL) Mr President, this Parliament is rightly paying great attention to what is going on in the former Belgian colony of the Democratic Republic of Congo and in particular to the continued fighting, forcible displacement, rape and mass assassination in the east of that vast country.
These horrors have been part of the conflict in the neighbouring countries of Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda.
Internationally recognised state borders have little meaning for groups of people who must seek new territories as a result of being expelled or the continuing lack of means of existence.
Everything is in motion in this region, and the thing is that the slightest movement one way or the other potentially stirs up either violence or horror.
Warlords who acquire respect, power and wealth by their innate love of conflict increase the already existing problems and make them even more difficult to solve.
Very recently, on 17 January, we discussed the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo here in this House and adopted a resolution that stated our wish to see all horrors cease.
I fear that we could adopt many more resolutions on this matter without any solutions coming of it.
The expectation that last year's elections in the Democratic Republic of Congo could solve the problems has ended in disappointment.
The incumbent president, Kabila, has won, but he represents different points of view from the movement from which he originated, and the outcomes of both the presidential and parliamentary elections were controversial for the opposition.
The question is, how is such a large country with poor lines of communication and a wide range of peoples to function in a way that is supported by its whole population and all its divergent political forces.
It does not seem that this is likely to succeed in an area like the Democratic Republic of Congo, where life-threatening diseases reign, the environment and the land are over-exploited, and people remain completely without rights.
The question is whether the armistice of 23 January for North and South Kivu, which takes for granted the disarmament of the warring factions and the return of refugees to their places of residence, is feasible, and whether the United Nations can contribute on the ground to this end.
It will not succeed by electing parties in the midst of conflict but possibly by persuading parties, the warring party for example, to abandon sexual violence and allow doctors in.
<D>
The main theme of the Spring European Council is the EU 2020 strategy.
At the start of this year, the unemployment rate reached 10%, while the figure in countries such as Spain and Latvia reached almost 20%.
67% of European citizens feel that job losses are their main concern.
European leaders' main concern must be to preserve existing jobs and create other new ones to allow European citizens to make a decent living.
This objective can only be guaranteed through making substantial investments in economic and social development, transport and energy infrastructure, agriculture, research, education and health.
This is precisely the reason that the European Council must focus particular attention on the EU's industrial policy.
According to European statistics, compared to December 2009, in January 2010, industrial output fell by 2% in the euro area and by 0.2% at EU27 level.
At Community level, industry generates 26.4% of GDP, but there are Member States where industrial output contributes only 14% of GDP.
The European Union must retain its global competitiveness.
In order to achieve this, jobs and industrial output must be kept within the European Union and not relocated to third countries.
<D>
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism. - (NL) Madam President, the moment of truth is fast approaching.
Tomorrow afternoon, we shall be voting on the report by Mrs Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou.
The rapporteur and I, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, share the same perspective on free enterprise, and so together we have signed 10 or so amendments that the Council, too, can accept.
I am grateful that Commissioner Tajani can support them.
Tomorrow, we shall first have to deal with the amendment tabled by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs that seeks to reject the proposal.
I am still highly indignant about this amendment.
Last week, however, this indignation turned to horror when I saw the position paper of the European trade unions.
For fear of a stray Romanian or Bulgarian self-employed driver, it dusts off untruth upon untruth to persuade MEPs to vote against the Commission proposal.
The paper intimates that self-employed drivers work 86-hour weeks.
Drivers, both employed and self-employed, are permitted to drive for an average of 45 hours per week in a two-week period, as Commissioner Tajani has also pointed out.
Are we to understand, then, that they are spending 41 hours per week working on their businesses?
Nor does the paper's argument about road safety hold water.
There is no evidence of a correlation between road safety and exempting self-employed drivers from the rules on working time; in fact, the reverse is true.
Incidentally, it is clear from the position paper that the trade unions know full well that their position is extremely tenuous.
The environment and the internal market are dragged in kicking and screaming to supposedly demonstrate that we should vote in favour of the rejection proposal, when the Commission's very extensive impact assessment shows that the proposal will actually be beneficial to the functioning of the internal market, the transport sector and the environment.
That is why, tomorrow, we must vote against the amendment tabled by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs that seeks to reject the proposal, and in favour of the rapporteur's amendments.
I trust that common sense will prevail during the vote.
Finally, I wish to add that I thought the email Mr Hughes sent last Saturday completely inappropriate.
Making politics out of the fatalities of ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam Commissioner, Sri Lanka's brutal civil conflict is finally nearing its end.
Of course, it is too early to say whether this will mean the end of terrorist activity by the Tamil Tigers.
We certainly should not support a permanent ceasefire at this stage in case it allows the Tigers to regroup.
In my view, their only option now is to lay down their arms or be defeated militarily with more casualties.
A long-term ceasefire would be a disaster because - as a suicide attack in Sri Lanka earlier this week demonstrates - the LTTE is ruthless, bloodthirsty and rightly identified as a terrorist organisation by the European Union and the United States.
We should be resolute in our support for President Rajapaksa in his efforts to end an insurgency that has only brought untold human misery to Sri Lanka and severely retarded economic development on that beautiful island.
However, thousands of innocent civilian IDPs still remained trapped on a narrow coastal strip.
These civilians must be allowed to leave so that the army can conclude its offensive.
It is reprehensible, but entirely to be expected of the Tigers, that they are exploiting these civilians as human shields.
The Tigers have been deaf to appeals from the international community to surrender and establish a temporary humanitarian corridor.
Nevertheless, allowing the UN and other organisations to arrange safe passage from the conflict zone for these civilians is essential to avoid further bloodbaths.
Sri Lanka appreciates its own responsibility in this regard and wants to avoid civilian casualties but, understandably, the army's patience is limited and fears that the Tigers will seek to escape by a sea evacuation procedure, mixing in with the civilians.
Therefore, we on this side of the House endorse the establishment of a humanitarian corridor and a temporary and immediate ceasefire or cessation of hostilities, but we also want to see the comprehensive defeat of the LTTE and a peaceful, just and multi-ethnic Sri Lanka established in its place, where there is maximum autonomy to the Tamil majority areas and an equitable sharing of resources and power within a unitary Sri Lankan state.
<D>
(SL) I endorse the report by the rapporteur, Mr Coelho, who has produced an excellent piece of work, as always.
I agree with the proposals put forward, including that concerning the 'one person-one passport' principle.
However, I would like to hear what the Commission, in particular, or perhaps even my colleague Mr Coelho has to say about the question of what we should do when children travel alone, unaccompanied by their parents, as there is no uniform policy as regards which documentation they have to carry with them.
The rapporteur's proposal is that the names of those with parental responsibility should be printed in the child's passport.
However, sometimes, children travel accompanied by other family members and may, in fact, even live with them and so on.
In short, we should be reasonably flexible in this regard.
On the other hand, I am concerned that no one has challenged the practicability of six-year-old children travelling unaccompanied.
It might be possible by plane (let us not, at this juncture, discuss the possible traumas that the child - a six-year-old boy or girl - might experience on a plane), as the child could be accompanied onto the plane, met at the other end and chaperoned to one of his or her parents, for example, or to someone else.
However, what arrangements would pertain when children travel by train, coach or other means of public transport?
How would that be monitored?
If there are parents who are irresponsible enough to send their children on such journeys, I think that we should take a more positive stance on this and say that children are not permitted to travel on their own at such a young age.
That may, perhaps, sound somewhat harsh, but as much has already been said here on how precious children are and on the topic of kidnapping and so on, we should also make a bolder statement on this issue.
I would also like to ask the Commission how things stand with the joint statement of the Council and the European Parliament concerning the security of the original documents needed in order for a visa to be issued.
This is because I am somewhat concerned that, if it is true, the system in a particular Member State might be allowing abuse to take place at the point of issue.
I would put one final question to the Commission, or perhaps to Mr Coelho: what should we do when people arrive at a border, but the data in their passports does not correspond with that held in official databases?
I think that we ought to include an instruction that benefits the child, or rather, the passenger.
<D>
Vice-President of the Commission. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first to thank you very much for the broad support this debate has shown for the transatlantic economic cooperation project and reemphasise that this project can be successful only if all institutions are involved.
The Council has its role to play, Parliament has its role, and the Commission is making an effort to play its part too.
I would like to disagree with and reassure those who expressed the concern that this is a type of transatlantic protectionism or that the two largest and most powerful economic regions in the world are walling themselves in.
Transatlantic economic cooperation is not directed against anybody.
It is very interesting to know that the economic regions already mentioned in this debate are already showing great interest in this work and have already asked, more or less outright, whether we could imagine doing something similar with other entities.
My answer is always the same: we would like to wait and see whether the model that we have created here actually works, because we are still in the early stages.
I would like to try again to show that there are a variety of dimensions here.
The actual core business is eliminating trade barriers.
It is just as Mr Harbour said: these are trade barriers.
When you look at it closely, it is incomprehensible, unbelievable, that we have been carrying on like this for so many years.
He is absolutely right.
It is because the bureaucrats cannot agree.
What we are doing here is prodding the bureaucrats into action, forcing them to speak to each other, setting terms of reference for them.
Madam President, let me add an aside here.
Although I have been in this business for a long time, I learnt something new by being involved in this.
I always thought that if a political process in the United States was controlled by the White House, all it took was the touch of a button and the entire administration and the executive did what the President wanted.
Even in the United States, that is not the case.
Europe is not alone in having problems activating its bureaucracy - the Americans have the same problem.
That, then, is our core task.
We are talking here about things that free the economy on both sides from many many billions of euros of unnecessary expenses, money that could be invested, or used to create jobs and promote clever innovations.
That is the key task.
The second dimension involves looking much farther ahead to consider whether we could perhaps manage to work with common standards.
For example, the US co-chairman and I agreed that it does not make sense for the United States and Europe to develop standards and compete against each other with these standards in third markets.
The attempt to do a lot more together and to prevent problems in future regulations is one reason why we are holding close talks about nanotechnology, and why we are discussing standards for biofuels.
We are doing all this so that it does not have to be repeated in the future, so that things will not grow apart.
I also wish to share my personal vision.
I think that, given the very different philosophies on both sides of the Atlantic, for example about how to achieve product safety, we can ultimately achieve the goal only if we are prepared to recognise each other's philosophies and regulatory methods, if, for example, we recognise that the Americans are just as reluctant to poison their citizens as we are, and if the Americans admit that we are just as reluctant to expose our citizens to danger from electrical appliances as they are.
Thus there is a basic foundation of mutual recognition of sensible regulations.
Now the third dimension.
This is the area that this afternoon's discussion concentrated on almost exclusively - the big, far-reaching issues, sometimes involving global politics, that have been mentioned here.
I agree with Erika Mann and would like to ask you not to overload the Council, apart from the fact that we have a framework agreement that prescribes what topics we can tackle and what we cannot.
Many topics were mentioned that were definitely not provided for in the framework agreement and for which there are other forums.
Nevertheless, experience has already shown that practical cooperation does make it necessary to debate the big strategic issues with each other, such as the future of the world trade system, the issue of protectionism, how to deal with investments from state funds, the issue of food and energy prices and that of the potential need to regulate financial services.
That is exactly what we are doing.
We have found a way of responding very quickly and very flexibly.
Therefore, I cannot exclude that over the long term, we may discuss topics that go beyond what was actually set out in the framework agreement.
Let me repeat: this debate has encouraged me to keep going along the well-worn path and to make sure that this time we will be successful.
Together, we have enormous potential, which we have not even begun to make the most of.
When we eliminate the barriers that prevent us tapping our full economic potential, then we can do a great deal more to achieve our political, social and ecological goals.
That is what it is all about.
<D>
Madam President, I think this is one of the saddest days in our plenary work over these five years because it is the first time I, at least, personally, feel that this has become an intergovernmental body.
This reminds me of the nights in Amsterdam in 1997; this reminds me of the nights in Nice in 2000.
And today in the group, and I think here in plenary, we can see what it is all about.
I really thought that the European Parliament was here to represent the interests of all European peoples, not narrow national interests.
We have three options on the table: one is the Severin-Lamassoure proposal, which I think is a European proposal.
It is an excellent proposal and they have done a fantastic job and should be congratulated for it.
(Applause)
The second option that we have is to go back to Nice.
Perhaps some of us want that; I do not know.
But do we really?
Is that why we are going through this whole debate?
Do we want to go back to Nice?
Does Spain want to lose seats?
Does Poland want to lose seats?
I do not know.
The third option is what I call a provocative option and that is two provocations: one, to give the big states a hell of a lot more and the small states a hell of a lot less.
The other provocation came from the other side, to give the little ones a lot and give absolutely nothing to the big.
Is that what we want?
Is that what we are here for?
I do not think so.
At least, I do not hope so.
Tomorrow's debate is about the credibility of the European Parliament and whether we can take a rational, logical and fair decision.
Are we capable of coming up with a proposal, or are we just like the Member States?
(Applause)
<D>
Mr President, the compromise achieved concerning feedstuffs does have certain advantages - it harmonises and simplifies EU legislation - but it also has fundamental flaws: it does not offer sufficient guarantee of the safety of animal feeds and of foods, it affords weak protection of the interests of the five million farmers who breed and raise animals, and it does not sufficiently protect our health.
The access of animal feed users to information about the contents of the feed will still be limited by the protection of intellectual property rights.
If the producer of a feedstuff uses a dangerous ingredient, we will still be vulnerable.
The problem of feedstuffs is further proof of the mistaken direction being taken by agricultural policy which, in spite of declarations, supports industrial agriculture first and foremost and, in such agriculture, farmers do not have to have their own feedstuffs and can raise animals using feedstuffs produced by specialised businesses.
These businesses are, of course, profit-driven and will always find a way to reduce costs, but will not necessarily take into account the safety of animals or our health.
As a consequence, we have to multiply specific provisions and increase monitoring, which takes the matter to an absurd level.
Is it not time to reverse these tendencies and to return to the sustainable development of agriculture, in which farmers will have their own feedstuffs and will not be exposed to the losses caused by dioxins or BSE?
Progress in agriculture does not have to mean the concentration of production or the concentration of feedstuff production.
We should bear in mind that in the EU, we currently have 15 million farms, and as many as 95% of these are small and medium-sized farms.
Most of these farms can use the sustainable model of agriculture for the good of farmers, the environment and of us all.
We only need to radically change our approach to agriculture, and in doing so to change our approach to current common agricultural policy.
<D>
(FR) Mr President, to a president to whom history has not been kind - I am referring to Chairman Mao, not President Sarkozy - one can offer the following maxim: 'as long as you are still falling, you have not yet reached the bottom'.
The world economy has not yet reached the bottom.
The financial crisis has had its run extended.
A new financial scandal is demonstrating the incredible irresponsibility of bankers in the face of the capitalism of speculation, while the same bankers are rediscovering all their supercilious inflexibility when considering requests for credit from consumers and business-owners.
As the European Central Bank lowers interest rates, the banks are increasing their margins.
The states that have just bailed out their banks ought to make it mandatory for them to pass on immediately the significant reductions to the ECB's base rate.
This would be a recovery measure that would cost national budgets nothing.
The economic recovery plan adopted by the European Council is unsatisfactory.
Apart from the additional loans by the European Investment Bank, there is practically no extra money.
The United States is going to inject more sizeable amounts into its economy.
It can do so because the rest of the world is continuing to offer it credit despite the colossal deficits of the US state, its businesses and its citizens.
Europe is paying a very high price for the absence of a truly unified macroeconomic policy.
The timidity of the ECB and the euro area states is preventing us from funding a more effective economic recovery policy through the issue of Eurobonds guaranteed by a European Union whose funding capacity remains intact.
Mr President, thank you, I will stop there, but President Sarkozy spoke for 72 minutes while we have 90 seconds in which to express our views.
<D>
on behalf of the EFD Group. - (NL) The call to jihad has already gone out both inside and outside Xinjiang, and now the bloody clashes between Han Chinese and Uighurs on Chinese territory threaten to escalate dramatically, both in China and beyond.
The local Christian community is straining absolutely every sinew against the dangerous religious dimension of the ethnic divisions in Xinjiang.
The community prays specifically for peace, stability and justice for all the citizens of Xinjiang.
Irrationally enough, the Chinese Government does not take hold of this helping hand, but strikes it down repressively.
This can be seen from a blatant campaign by government agencies against peaceful protestant house churches of late.
Thus, on 3 July, eight Christians were arrested in Xinjiang during a service.
Four of them are still being held in a secret location, while two Chinese-American missionaries have simply gone missing.
I ask the Council and the Commission to intervene with the Chinese authorities as a matter of urgency in order to ensure freedom of religious practice for all in this critical situation in Xinjiang.
This would be the only effective antidote to the call to jihad and would also provide proof to Chinese house churches that they are part of Beijing's plans to create a harmonious society.
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is a fact that harmful and risky alcohol consumption has a considerable health, economic and social impact.
It is, however, also a fact that alcohol forms part of the European cultural heritage and the majority of Europeans take a responsible attitude to it.
So we do not want to condemn alcohol as such or lay down new laws.
What we want to do is to focus on groups at risk and risky situations.
A young person who drinks him or herself into oblivion, a pregnant women who damages her unborn child because of alcohol consumption, or a drunken driver who puts himself or others in danger: it is in precisely those areas that we need to act.
This report provides an excellent basis for doing so.
It is balanced, targeted and includes all stakeholders: Member States, the alcohol industry, retailers, the catering industry, doctors, schools and parents.
It clearly demarcates the various powers.
The Member States are the main players.
The EU only has a supporting role.
Its task is to collect data, point to well-established procedures and draw up and support information campaigns.
It is up to Member States to improve the implementation of existing national legislation.
What, after all, is the point of strict youth protection legislation if it is not observed and if offences go unpunished?
We also recommend a 0.00% limit for young newly-qualified drivers and professional lorry drivers.
The alcohol industry should undertake to refrain from directing alcohol advertising at young people.
My Group is not, however, in favour of obligatory warnings on alcoholic beverages, which is why I ask you to support the draft amendments deleting provisions to that effect from the report.
It is well known, and surveys confirm it, that warning labels have no effect in this case.
On the contrary, people need to be informed as early as possible about the dangers of alcohol abuse.
We must inform and we must convince, rather than prescribe and prohibit.
I think we have reached the point where we must realise that we are the representatives of the people, not their educators.
I thank Mr Foglietta, the rapporteur, for the close collaboration.
<D>
If the Montreal protocol, which entered into force 20 years ago and was signed by 193 nations, had not banned products that contributed to the reduction of the ozone layer, planet earth would have faced a catastrophic scenario.
The main substances attributed to the depletion of atmospheric ozone are halogenated hydrocarbons, chemicals invented in 1928 as refrigerants.
In the 1980s, when the hole in the ozone layer was discovered, researchers found that these chemical compounds, virtually inactive at the level of the earth's surface, were able to interact with the ozone molecules in the atmosphere, destroying the layer that acts as a protective screen against dangerous UV rays.
In order to remedy this situation, the Montreal Protocol was signed in 1987 and entered into force two years later.
One thing is certain; we did everything to make our air unbreathable.
Progress played an important role in that phase, providing us with a series of goods and services that in the course of the last few decades have contributed to a progressive deterioration of our climate system's condition.
The greenhouse effect, the hole in the ozone layer and climate upheaval are just a few of the phenomena that must become the centre of our attention as soon as possible, since they represent our fellow citizens and future children in Europe.
That is why I am in favour.

If we cast a glance at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) GDP scale (the EU is in first place, Lithuania is 82nd), we can see that GDP does not tell the entire story.
GDP does not sufficiently reflect the complex socio-economic reality of national and regional challenges.
Although GDP is a strong macro-economic indicator, it does not reflect Lithuania's greatest social problems, such as unemployment, the quality of education and health care systems and disparities in income distribution.
In Lithuania, and at EU level, there is often a lack of clear information, data and indicators, and I therefore support the rapporteur's proposal to provide a better report on social indicators.
I hope that this will provide more comprehensive information for developing policies.
Nowadays, unfortunately, politicians often do not have such information.
The development of EU policies should not be purely based on abstract statistics.
Above all, EU policy should be measured by the progress made in improving the well-being of Europeans.
The 'Beyond GDP' method mentioned in this report may prove very useful.
However, before implementing it, we should find out more about the possibilities of adapting the new method in everyday life.
<D>
(RO) During the current economic crisis, the Europe 2020 strategy seems to be posing a real challenge.
On the other hand, it provides an opportunity as well.
It can give an important fillip in terms of supporting the economic and social reforms required long term.
Solidarity and adaptability must be the principles on which it is founded.
I believe that the allocations for the Cohesion Funds must be kept as they play a fundamental role in reducing the disparities in economic development between the EU's regions.
On the other hand, it goes without saying that the objectives adopted at European Union level cannot automatically become national objectives.
They must be adapted according to the possibilities of each country.
The Romanian Government has set up a high-level working group which will set national objectives.
At the same time, it will help coordinate the drafting of the National Reform Plan.

rapporteur. - Mr President, I think it is fair to say that we are now in a new era of energy policy, where there is a need for energy policy to be consistent with a policy for stopping climate change, and at the same time to be combined with a policy for energy security.
Those three legs - energy policy, climate policy and energy security - must function together.
From my perspective this highlights the importance of nuclear power.
It is important that the existing nuclear power plants are managed in as safe and secure a way as possible, but it is also important that we have clear rules to ensure that the future power plants of the European Union are as secure and safe as possible.
This is not only a matter of preparing the ground for more nuclear power.
I think that there is rather large support for such a policy in the European Union, that it is growing and that we need to live up to the responsibilities that this gives us all.
I respect those who are hesitant about or are against the use of nuclear power, but whatever opinion and whatever view we have on nuclear power, there can be no disagreement on the need for the rules to be as safe and secure as possible for the nuclear power we have.
It is from this perspective that I would like to present this report on the Community framework for nuclear safety.
There is a legal basis for this and there has been a debate in committee on whether all the procedures have been fulfilled.
A letter has been sent from the Committee on Legal Affairs to the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy saying that if it is a new proposal then there is a need for a new opinion from the group of experts.
My view, and the view of the majority of the committee, is that this is a revised proposal which we have been working on in the European Union for nearly seven years.
It has been changed because of an opinion from the group of experts and because of the opinion given by Parliament and I must say that now is the time to reach a decision.
I hope that Council will be able to take this decision this spring.
If we do not and if we delay this process, we will see in reality that new nuclear power plants will be planned and constructed without this Community framework.
So this is the time for action.
Those who are trying to hinder this because of their attitude to nuclear power are in reality preventing the European Union from having a Community framework establishing as safe and secure rules as possible.
I have tried to position my report in three ways.
First of all to give a clear structure on the responsibilities of Member States and governments, licence holders and national regulators.
Secondly, I have been very clear about the independence that the national regulators will have and I am strengthening the requirements on national regulators, meaning that they must be able to act when they see any risk of a nuclear power plant not fulfilling the security rules.
Thirdly, we are including in an annex the rules of the IAEA as binding rules, thereby making this Community framework clear, strict and firm, and that is the note on which I end.
<D>
author. - Madam President, Sri Lanka's bloody civil war seems finally to be coming to a conclusion.
The LTTE, which has been blacklisted by the EU as a terrorist organisation, must now surely lay down its arms and surrender.
The EU and other Co-chairs have urged the LTTE to do so.
The LTTE's response will show us whether it really has the best interests of Tamils at heart.
The LTTE is using its front organisations in Europe to maximum propaganda effect and raising money by extortion internationally.
Some LTTE militants may even try to seek asylum within the European Union.
Throughout this ferocious 26-year civil war, the LTTE has pioneered atrocious terrorist tactics, such as suicide bombings, that are now used in many other parts of the world - regrettably.
The Sri Lankan army has had, therefore, to deploy all the means at its disposal to counteract this brutal insurgency.
However, it is clear that the casualty figures claimed by the LTTE have been exaggerated.
Some have now been withdrawn - for instance, the Agence Presse story of 300 civilians killed, after the supposed author denied authorship.
Nevertheless, the death of civilians in a war zone is tragic whenever and wherever it occurs.
Clearly, the Sri Lankan armed forces cannot claim an unblemished record either, but they have not sought to deliberately exploit civilians and put them in harm's way, like the LTTE has allegedly done.
If the war really is soon to be over, it is essential that Sri Lanka turn its attention now to post-conflict disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration.
The marginalisation of Tamils, at the expense of the majority Sinhalese, needs to be addressed in an urgent and permanent manner in order to ensure a stable and sustainable multiethnic society with regional devolution.
The EU should also ensure resources are put at Sri Lanka's disposal to support post-conflict development.
Although we should support the Government's offer of amnesty for the majority of the LTTE, it is vital that no one responsible for the most serious war crimes is allowed to get away with impunity.
<D>
in writing. - (DE) Commissioner Potočnik, talking about the role of SMEs is the done thing in this House.
Indeed, small and medium-sized enterprises are the backbone of the EU economy.
In Germany alone, almost 20 million people are working, researching and developing in more than 3.3 million small and medium-sized enterprises.
Whether Europe grows or stagnates mainly depends on them.
Small and medium-sized enterprises produce more patents, innovations and jobs than the large conglomerates.
Yet the SMEs continue to have too little access to loans and funding programmes.
Eurostars is a good example of how things work.
Unlike the Seventh Framework Programme, which is based on a top-down approach with central funding by the EU, Eureka and Eurostars are bottom-up approaches.
The programmes are managed by the Eureka Initiative.
This is a good thing, and could also perhaps be a model for our Seventh Framework Programme.
The advantages of the Eurostars programme are as follows:
• research-intensive SME required in leadership role
• eligibility checking and evaluation by international experts
• harmonised invitations to tender and workflows in all Member States
• fast decision making regarding funding: 14 weeks after the cut-off date
• the Commission awards additional top-up
• funding exclusively in the form of non-repayable grants (cash allowance)
I should like to congratulate the rapporteur warmly on his work.
I wish the programme every success.

in writing. - (SV) In Sweden both the previous and the present governments have made positive statements on the forthcoming 'health check' of the EU's long-term budget and the common agricultural policy over the next few years in the expectation that it will lead to very considerable changes and reforms.
Now we see the Federalist majority in the European Parliament taking the view that the Heads of State or Government undertook in 2002 to maintain the first-pillar agricultural funds in full at the same level until 2013 and that that undertaking should be respected.
How can the 2002 agreement be interpreted in such different ways?
The Christian Democrat/Conservative and Social Democrat majority in the European Parliament thinks that reforms are only to take place after 2013.
The Swedish Social Democrats and Alliance for Sweden have told voters in Sweden that reforms will be introduced directly into the long-term budget on the basis of the 'health check' in 2008-2009.
Which side is interpreting the 2002 agreement correctly?
Junilistan considers unequivocally that reforms to the common agricultural policy and a reduction of its costs in the EU budget must take place directly after the completion of the health check.
All other solutions would be a betrayal of the voters in the six Member States which, in 2005, did not want to expand the EU's long-term budget.
<D>
in writing. - Relations between the US and the European Union have always been strong.
It was with American aid that a shattered Europe was able to reconstruct and develop in the post war years.
Now the world again faces a crisis and it is more vital than ever that we retain this link and work together to resolve the problems which have beset the world economy.
The European Union and the United States have a strategic role to play in the recovery process.
Combined, our gross domestic product represents more than half the world's GDP, and we have the worlds strongest bilateral trade partnership, making up almost 40% of world trade.
However, further developments must be implemented if we are to combat the economic crisis effectively.
The Transatlantic Economic Council has created for itself the goal of an integrated Trans-Atlantic market by 2015.
This will be done by reducing barriers to trade.
If this goal is accomplished, economic growth can re-commence and the recovery process can begin.
The risk of a further 'Credit Crunch' is not over.
To avoid further economic collapse and unemployment, the EC must ensure coordinated economic policies are put in place in both areas.
<D>
With the Treaty of Lisbon, we conferred nationality upon the residents of the EU.
The next step is for the citizens of the EU to be given the citizens' initiative.
It is a rare moment when a legislative authority or an executive transfers some of its powers to the citizens.
This shows great maturity.
It is our response to the democracy deficit.
Our work is not based only on representative democracy - it is also based on participatory democracy.
Earlier development policy and consultations with citizens in the decision-making process have not always met the expectations of the European Union's residents.
The citizens' initiative, which is the result of a difficult compromise, has, firstly, ensured full transparency.
Secondly, we have simplified the whole system.
We have also brought in an innovation in the form of the option to submit statements of support online.
Today, major efforts at promoting the citizens' initiative await us, and these will have to be undertaken by the Commission and Parliament as well as by the Member States.
We should also consider if openness to the citizens' initiative might be threatened by demagogic or populist proposals.
I do not think this will happen.
Every initiative put forward by the citizens will of necessity involve increased responsibility on the part of the Commission and Parliament.
<D>
in writing. - (ET) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen.
Every person should have an equal right to participate fully in the life of society, including the right to work and be economically active, and to enjoy a normal standard of living and well-being for the society in which they live.
Employment is unquestionably the best way of preventing poverty and social exclusion.
It is, however, a curious fact that 20 million working people live in poverty in the EU today, most of them women.
To my mind, in addition to tackling the problems of poverty and social exclusion in vulnerable sections of the population, greater attention must be focused within the EU on poverty among working people, particularly among women.
A survey must be made of EU policies to stimulate the labour market: in order to offer people greater social protection, we need a springboard for regular, gainful and legally secure employment.
I am also of the view that the remuneration payable to workers in the Member States (the minimum wage) should be fair and should guarantee their income, thus preventing them from falling into the poverty trap.
I welcome the EU target set out in the report to provide for remuneration of at least 60% of the relevant (national, sectoral, etc.) average wage and the fact that the Member States have agreed on a timetable for achieving that target.
Only a balance between flexibility and protection can improve employment and social inclusion.
<D>
in writing. - (PL) The protection of the natural environment should undoubtedly be a priority for each Member State and for the Community as a whole.
As regards the initiative to establish a Global Climate Change Alliance, however, the best that can be said about is that it is pointless.
Spending taxpayers' money on yet another expensive political body will most certainly not help to improve the state of the natural environment.
It will merely provide additional lucrative posts to be filled by Brussels bureaucrats.
Developing countries produce far less pollution, and their carbon dioxide emissions are insignificant in comparison to those of the economic giants.
I should like to point out that for many years now the United States of America has been near the top of the list of countries producing toxic substances.
It has still not ratified the Kyoto Protocol.
I am convinced that establishing an alliance involving the EU and developing countries will not contribute in the least to reducing the level of pollution.
On the other hand, action such as conversations with the political leaders of the aforementioned countries, for example, could be crucial.
That is because they are the ones doing most to degrade the natural environment.
<D>
(BG) Ladies and gentlemen, in recent years in Bulgaria a despicable practice has been observed known as 'vote buying'.
This is being carried out by every single political group, apart from the patriotic Attack party.
Even parties describing themselves as an alternative to the ruling parties are paying voters, as indicated a few days ago by the information from the village of Brest near Pleven.
The forthcoming elections in our country look as if they are going to be the most rigged and underhand elections in Bulgaria's recent history.
The ethnic Turkish and anti-constitutional party MRF has earmarked the huge sum of EUR 60 million to help it get the maximum possible number of members of parliament representing Turkey's interests into both the European Parliament and the Republic of Bulgaria's National Assembly.
There is an absolutely real danger that the next European Parliament will have representatives who have won their seats as a result of vote buying.
Our message in Attack is: 'No Turkey in the EU', and we call on President Pöttering to urge the Bulgarian authorities to see to it that this move is foiled in the forthcoming elections through the adoption of election laws.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to thank not only Parliament in general but especially Mr Stavros Lambrinidis for his important report, which provides very timely input to the promotion of fundamental freedoms and security on the Internet.
Whilst the Internet has acquired a stronger and stronger weight in modern societies and economies, impacting in many areas of our lives, the tremendous pace of technological development raises, at the same time, significant challenges which need to be duly addressed if we want the full opportunities of the Internet and the information society to unravel.
We particularly share Mr Lambrinidis's concerns on the protection of personal data, an issue which is of utmost relevance to Internet users.
Let me assure you that the Commission continues to be committed to strengthening citizens' fundamental rights and fundamental freedoms, and in particular to ensuring a high level of protection of privacy and personal data, both on the Internet and in other contexts.
I firmly believe that the pursuit of adequate privacy protection does not stand in opposition to the need to ensure greater security.
Indeed, these two objectives can and should be pursued in synergy.
The stability and security of the Internet were our priorities during the World Summit on the Information Society in 2005, and we are continuing with these objectives.
These issues and will shortly be presented through a new strategy for the protection of Critical Information Infrastructures and in order to enhance Europe's preparation against large-scale cyber attacks and disruptions.
This strategy includes an action plan which defines a road map to promote principles and guidelines for the stability and resilience of the Internet.
Strategic cooperation with third countries will be developed within the strategy, notably in information society dialogues, as a vehicle to build global consensus in this area.
At the same time, the Commission is convinced that it is necessary to ensure respect for fundamental freedoms such as freedom of expression on the Internet.
Again, these two goals are not mutually exclusive.
Your report further elaborates on the possibility of working on global standards, data protection and freedom of speech.
The Commission participates in the yearly international conferences of Data Protection Commissioners and follows the ongoing work on possible future international standards on privacy and personal data protection.
We are strongly committed to promoting the high standards of protection which EU citizens enjoy at present.
Regarding freedom of speech, the Commission will continue to promote this fundamental right in international forums.
New legislation in this area would not be considered as the way forward for the time being.
We already have a number of binding international instruments on this subject.
At this point in time, I believe that it would be useful to engage in effective reflection on the proper ways to enforce the existing legislation.
So it is about implementation.
This reflection should also include and help global commercial players to better define their roles and their responsibilities in the promotion and strengthening of the fundamental freedom of expression in the global online environment of the Internet.
Let me conclude with a general comment.
I believe we should tackle the serious challenges that this report brings to light and make sure that the concrete exercise of rights and freedoms is not unduly limited on the Internet.
For example, an essential element of the Commission's strategy for a secure information society, since 2006, has been to have a holistic approach, ensuring coordination amongst stakeholders but also recognising that each of them has specific roles and responsibilities to fulfil.
We all have responsibilities to make sure that our actions on the Internet do not unduly limit - and, if possible, that they promote - the security of others on this medium.
It is, therefore, in the spirit of cooperation that the Commission welcomes and supports this report.
<D>
in writing. - (RO) I voted for the draft resolution which prevents the introduction of passenger screening as a means of tightening civil aviation security.
Passenger security is vitally important, but the measures being taken should not result in the violation of citizens' fundamental rights.
The introduction of body scanning, in the form it has been currently proposed, does not guarantee respect for the right to privacy.
I believe that studies need to be carried out in order to determine the effect of introducing this measure on human health, as well as an impact assessment in order to determine the convenience of these measures.
I also think that the procedures which should be adopted for handling the scanned images are extremely important.
In view of this, the European Data Protection Supervisor should formulate and issue a point of view so that any measures targeted at passenger security are implemented in compliance with the regulations governing personal data.
We await with interest additional data from the European Commission relating to the measures we have in mind for improving civil aviation security.
I was in favour of adopting this resolution today because the fundamental rights of the European Union's citizens need to be protected.
<D>
(DE) Madam President, the gap between the European Union and the citizens of Europe should not be as large as it has become.
We must ensure that this gap is reduced.
The Ombudsman has a very important role to play in this respect, in particular in areas where and at times when he does his job well.
The most important thing is that we can count on the Ombudsman's commitment and sense of proportion.
We must not raise excessive expectations which no one can meet.
On the other hand, it is also about ensuring that abuses which occur in the administration of European bodies are actually dealt with and, where possible, that sensible solutions are sought which will satisfy the citizens and ensure their security.
Until now the Ombudsman has shown that he takes this task seriously and performs it well.
We can only hope that this will continue to be the case and thank him and the rapporteur for this report.
<D>
(PL) Mr President, we are holding this discussion at a rather specific time - that is, when we have lost a good Commissioner for Transport, by whom I mean Jacques Barrot - a time when we are awaiting a new Commissioner.
In fact, I am interested in whether the designated candidate for Commissioner is listening to our discussion today, as that would surely be justified in every possible respect.
We are talking here about the road haulage sector, a sector that has made it possible to achieve a 40% rise in economic exchange between the EU Member States in the last five years.
We are talking about a sector that is de facto keeping Europe moving.
My view is that we need as much freedom as possible here, including in cabotage.
At the same time, though, we need as much firmness as possible, especially in combating practices such as the existence of rogue coach operators, who are frankly wrecking the market.
The sanction of withdrawing their licence is not applicable, as they do not have and have never had any such licence.
Throughout the sector, though, I can see several significant threats: the price of fuel and its rise, the way in which external transport costs are internalised, the way in which working time is executed, and I also have the impression that the profitability of haulage companies is generally falling.
This is why I would like to offer my particularly enthusiastic support to Mr Piecyk's report, in order to be able to discuss the issue of bus and coach transport and to vote in June.
I support Mr Sterckx's position on the need for a new study of the consequences of opening up the market, but this should also be linked to an assessment of the economic wellbeing of the road haulage sector.
<D>
(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, you have not answered the crucial question.
What are you doing in the interim?
There is a positive solution.
What will you do if a child is fatally injured in the meantime and you are partly responsible because you delayed taking action?
How will you deal with that?
You have to ask yourself these questions, as we do, too.
In terms of costs, there is a comparable parallel.
In the case of the rights of persons with disabilities in air transport, the costs are spread across everybody, which is only normal.
To conceive, give birth to and bring up a child is not just a private matter but a public task, a state task.
Everybody has to be prepared to take it on and also to fund it.
In my view at least, that is a matter of course.
Where children up to the age of 14 can travel by train for free, it is also the other passengers who contribute to that cost.
In the sector of air transport in particular, which is exempt from fuel tax - i.e. EUR 14 billion a year - we can surely raise a few euro to give children the best protection they need for the future.
<D>
(FR) Madam President, listening to all my colleagues this afternoon, I am quite surprised that we all agree on the need for a European single energy market, although I feel that we must work on energy efficiency so that consumers pay as little as possible.
We are therefore all agreed on the objective to be achieved, but not on how to go about achieving it.
I have not heard much talk or mention of the agreement secured by the Council on 6 June, which does not necessarily require the unbundling of ownership, production and distribution.
Now, if unbundling and the single market had triggered a fall in energy prices, it would be apparent.
This is not the case in Spain or in the UK, and the Commission has never been able to prove it.
Therefore, let us stop demonising certain companies which actually have the industrial expertise and have shown that they can operate efficiently.
When we want interconnection, when we want solidarity, it is doubtless preferable for Member States to be free to choose from several models.
Let us put an end to that single way of thinking that rejects the third way, that makes accusations of a 'Franco-German cartel'.
We know that the market alone cannot solve the issue of monopolies, which in any case exist everywhere.
The Member States have taken a step towards an acceptable package that can be fine-tuned.
If we do not accept it, we risk having no text at all, while our citizens are kept waiting.
More importantly, I do not want to see good guys on one side of this Chamber and bad guys - i.e. those who still want to reach an agreement with the Council - on the other.
<D>
(PL) It has been suggested that migration might be one way of alleviating the negative consequences of the demographic crisis.
It is very important to encourage citizens of third countries to enter the territory of the Union in order to take up employment.
We are, however, only interested in legal residence and legal employment.
Illegal foreign workers mean budgetary losses and distort healthy competition between enterprises.
The employers benefit most from the efforts of illegal workers.
They can easily procure a cheap labour force.
Foreigners from third countries are most often employed in the heaviest and lowest paid jobs.
As they are in a difficult situation, they are prepared to do everything the employers ask of them.
The latter often exploit their despair.
Not only are these people poorly paid, but they are also working without any social protection or health insurance and are under constant threat of expulsion from the country where they are staying.
The Union should make it easier for immigrants to take up employment, and we should act accordingly.
I have in mind, for example, work in Poland for citizens of Ukraine.
<D>
(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is a really interesting, good debate - for the simple reason that, looking at the reports, we are combining two aspects that do not, at first, appear to be directly linked but which are related to ways of coping with the crisis and reviving the economy.
I was shadow rapporteur in the Committee on Legal Affairs for the Weber report, on which I should first like to congratulate Mrs Weber most warmly.
The Weber report is not about crisis management in the traditional sense but about simplifying company law and helping to cut red tape and eliminate burdens on companies.
This, coming at this specific point in time, at the end of the parliamentary term, clearly proves and exemplifies the European Parliament's handling of this particular issue and its attempts to further develop company law in the interests of companies - which I very much welcome.
As this debate also presents the opportunity to say something about financial market legislation in general, it should be noted that the fact that we in Parliament are now achieving results and concluding our proceedings at first reading on the first financial market package also sends out a signal towards the end of this parliamentary term.
I believe that this, too, is important.
Nevertheless, I should also like to point out that the second package - which, of course, is still being prepared by the Commission at the moment - will unfortunately be too late for this parliamentary term.
There are reasons for this.
As you will remember, we have indeed discussed the regulation of certain areas of financial markets in the past, namely in the committees of this House and on various occasions in plenary, but this always met with massive opposition.
There was opposition from the Council.
The socialist UK Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, refused to acknowledge certain realities for a long time.
There was also opposition from the Commission - which had been offering resistance on hedge funds and other sectors for a long time - and from within this House.
When it came to launching legislative own-initiative reports, the Chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs rejected this for a long time on account of an unnecessary dispute over competences.
I am pleased that everyone has now seen the light.
Commissioner McCreevy is regulating hedge funds, Mrs Berès is permitting own-initiative reports and Gordon Brown, too, has changed his mind.
This is a positive development, one that my group and I very much welcome.
<D>
The House Rules of Procedure state that voting is normally to be by show of hands unless a roll-call vote is specifically requested.
When voting by show of hands it may so happen, not often but from time to time, and only from time to time, that either because MEPs do not raise their hands or because there is some confusion, the presidency makes a mistake when assessing the outcome of a vote.
Should that happen then, again frequently, an MEP will request verification and as a result the President holds a roll-call vote to that end and the situation is resolved.
This is all, therefore, provided for, and our votes proceed perfectly correctly 99.9% of the time.
In any event, the President of the Parliament received a letter from Mr Booth MEP noting this issue and requesting action to be taken on it.
This matter will be discussed at the Conference of Presidents and, of course by the working group looking at reform of the House's working methods.
This is in train.
Please be assured therefore, Mr Farage, that we are going to pay a great deal of attention to this matter and are seeking to ensure that things run more smoothly every day.
Mr Swoboda, we are going to vote today by roll call, which is also in accordance with the Rules of Procedure as a roll-call vote has been requested by a political group.
Today.
And from today we will take decisions.
<D>
(PT) Mr President, we will only find out if the EU-Africa Summit was worth the effort in 2010 when the next summit will be held, depending on whether the issues discussed at that time are new or the same as today.
That will be the criterion and the time for assessing the results of what happened this weekend in Lisbon.
However, in the meantime, we can take stock to a certain extent.
This summit was presented as a summit for dialogue, genuinely bilateral partnership and common sharing of responsibilities.
These are worthy aims.
In the new relationship between Europe and Africa, there can be no one leader as Africans must be responsible for their own destiny.
It is up to us, the European neighbours, to be generous and consistent in our development aid.
If, in 2010, we are well on the way to achieving the Millennium Development Goals and if there are fewer deaths, less hunger, more democracy, more respect for human rights, more fair trade and more growth and development, then this summit will have been a success.
If the same dictators are still in power and the same deals are still being done, bringing many benefits to very few, then it will sadly have been an opportunity lost.
<D>
(DE) Madam President, the rapporteur claims that he was not responsible for the delay.
He most certainly was!
He was also behind the to-do in committee, and I really do not need to say any more about that.
(FR) Madam President, I would like to say one more thing by pointing out that the explanatory statement drawn up by the rapporteur contains remarks that are completely off the subject and out of context with the theme being dealt with in this report.
The rapporteur's own personal views on ...
(The President asked the speaker to stand down)
You are the chairman of a working group.
I have to say that the rapporteur's personal views on the pensions paid to EU staff members have no place in an official document put out by this institution.
I would like to have this put on record.
<D>
Mr President, my group welcomes the remarks made by Minister Vondra about Guantánamo Bay.
It appears that, in principle, the European Union is seeking a common response, and the Czech Presidency will help us in this.
Where exactly inmates will be moved to is still a question of national agreement, but it is reported that Europe will, in principle, react positively to the request from the US.
This will please Parliament, because we asked back in 2006 for the EU Member States to insist proactively on the resettlement of former inmates, including in the European Union.
My question to the Council is: are you prepared to do this in a proactive manner?
Would you ask the US now who the inmates are?
Will you ask about their backgrounds and what will happen to them, so that we can make the necessary arrangements?
I am, however, pleased with this positive attitude, which will hopefully end the human rights violations to which these people have been exposed.
Mr President, whilst this is wonderful for Guantánamo Bay, which is a symbol, we should not forget that there are also other prisons we should voice an opinion about.
Bagram, near Kabul, springs to mind, for example, where some 600 to 700 people are being held.
I am asking the Council and Commission to ensure that those prisons will also be closed.
Although I was pleased with the remarks about Guantánamo Bay, I am a little dismayed at the CIA.
I appreciate that above all, the Council wants to look ahead, not back.
I can understand that very well, because when you look back, you see a huge mess.
It would be too simplistic to say that since the US now has a new President, we can apply the same standards again for us all, and forget to look in our own hearts and overlook the aid that we have given to a government of which you now say that it has acted incorrectly.
<D>
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) How many times have we stood in this House before talking about Burma?
Several times a year we stand here and still the case remains hopeless.
However, the situation in Burma has become even worse than last time we spoke about it.
One point four million victims have still not received any help.
Thirty thousand children are suffering from acute malnutrition.
Hundreds of thousands are homeless and at risk of cholera, pneumonia and infectious diseases.
I understand that this morning as many as eight foreign doctors from Médecins Sans Frontières have been allowed into the disaster area.
I should like in any case to back the appeal that Mr Nassauer has made to ASEAN.
It must now finally show determination, because it is clear that the junta is more interested in the survival of its own regime through the referendum that is not worthy of the name - Mr Wiersma calls that 'Kafkaesque' - than the survival of its own people.
The generals think that foreigners coming into the country would threaten the survival of the military regime.
It is clear, though, that Médecins Sans Frontières, Oxfam, the British, French and US ships are bringing aid goods, not regime change, however much I might wish for that myself.
However, we can apparently not convince the junta of that, so we have to look for alternatives.
I think the best alternative is the Security Council.
Europe and the United States must insist that the situation in Burma is put on the agenda.
All the United Nations Member States have signed up to the following two principles: accepting responsibility for the protection of citizens and, if a country is no longer able or willing to do that, the right of the international community to intervene in disasters.
The United Nations has to act.
I understand the problems and I am proud of Commissioner Michel who, instead of wringing his hands and convening working groups, just got down to it with the motto 'deeds, not words'.
That impresses me.
I also think the support promised by the European Union is exemplary.
I believe the French Minister, Mr Kouchner, is right in saying that the junta is guilty of a crime against humanity.
I do wonder why we, the other 26 EU Member States, are not listening hard.
Mr President, aid must be brought to the Burmese people, with or without the consent of the junta.
Withholding essential support is a crime against humanity.
I would like to see the European Union take the initiative in getting the United Nations and the Security Council to refer this case to the prosecutor at the International Criminal Court in The Hague.
Enough is enough, patience has run out.
I would say, drag the junta into the International Criminal Court.
That is what we want.
The way the situation is now, they are the ones who belong behind bars, not the dissidents in Burma!
<D>
(RO) The way in which the issue of closing down and then decommissioning the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant will be resolved is not relevant, except in terms of the way Bulgaria itself resolves this issue.
However, as has already been said in this Chamber, the decommissioning process also affects neighbouring countries and may provide a precedent for other countries with similar units approaching the end of their maximum operational life.
I am not going to hide the fact either, as has already been said, that the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant has been a permanent source of concern for Romanian citizens, especially following the Chernobyl accident.
This is why it would be important for the decommissioning process to be accompanied by a public information campaign targeted at all the stakeholders who are entitled to know about the stages involved in this process, the timetable, the potential risks of each stage, the way in which fissile material and hazardous waste are protected, as well as about the ecological reconstruction of the Kozloduy area.
I wish to stress the importance we need to attach to the processing of radioactive waste.
This is why the funds allocated to Bulgaria for this purpose must be provided at regular intervals without any interruptions.
I am mentioning this point because, although the costs seem large enough, they are only estimates as there has been no precedent on the scale of decommissioning a nuclear power plant in Bulgaria.
I wish to end by saying, on a hopeful note, that, with sufficient funding and meticulous planning and subject to the supervision of all the bodies with the necessary powers in this area, the decommissioning process will provide an example of a good use of European funds.
<D>
(PL) Mr President, the cost of visas for non-EU citizens has increased following the extension of the Schengen zone.
Belarusians, for example, now have to pay 12 times as much for a visa - 60 euros instead of 5 euros.
That is as much as a junior doctor earns in Belarus.
Sixty euros is a third of the average monthly wage.
For many Belarusians it is a barrier that prevents them from obtaining visas and visiting their EU neighbours.
The Union is impeding direct contact between citizens just when it is enshrining a policy of good neighbourliness in the Treaty of Lisbon.
The increase in the price of visas is thus a painful paradox.
It is also a perfect present for President Lukashenko, who says Belarusians can expect nothing from Europe.
Ladies and gentlemen, this must be changed.
I call for all steps to be taken to reduce the price of visas for citizens of Belarus.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, first of all, may I comment on Mr Florenz's report which, in my view, has summed up the current scientific consensus very well.
Nonetheless, I voted against the report.
The climate is an important issue, and I agree that we must take action here.
However, the scientific consensus is only a provisional consensus, just as every scientific consensus of the past hundred years was short term in nature.
In every case, we move on from them.
The report before us does not offer us enough opportunities here.
What is more, the specific measures outlined are one-sided.
We must ensure that Europe does not forfeit any of its economic capacities.
Europe cannot save the world on its own.
Other countries need to be involved as a matter of urgency in addressing this global problem.
That is the only way to implement the scientific consensus.
We cannot bear this burden on our own.
Against this background, what I feel is lacking in the report is the catalogue of measures which are required to mitigate climate change.
We probably cannot stop it altogether.
That being the case, I believe that measures that will permanently alter our industrial structures cannot be adopted on the basis of what is only a provisional scientific consensus.
<D>
(FR) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, in order to meet our expectations and those of our fellow citizens, the Council that you preside over and Parliament must demonstrate a clear, understandable and concrete political will.
Your presence at the head of the Council is already a guarantee of determination.
In this respect, we have all seen, here in Strasbourg and in Brussels, the quality of preparation for this six-month Presidency, and the extent to which the members of the French Government make themselves available.
The priorities that you have just set out are the right ones to respond to the concerns of EU citizens.
In the same way, the other challenges that you raised, including the economic governance of the euro area in response to the explosion of global prices of raw materials and hydrocarbons, or the creation of an area of stability and prosperity in the Mediterranean Basin, are entirely representative of your commitment to a European Union that is more reactive to problems and more attentive to its population.
In response to public opinion, where there are doubts and people sometimes give in to the temptation to withdraw to national level in order to solve problems, it is more important than ever to point out that our continent has a considerable number of assets and is still one of the rare areas of stability in a world that is increasingly unpredictable.
The European Union should seek to demonstrate that it does not undergo globalisation without protecting its people, and I welcome your commitment to proving that.
Finally, as the Union is going through a significant crisis of confidence, we sincerely want the French Presidency to bring an end to the more than fifteen years of efforts to reform the functioning of the enlarged Europe.
We need the Lisbon Treaty to come into force as soon as possible, which you have strongly affirmed.
We all have confidence in you to negotiate with our Irish friends and to convince the few Member States that are still hesitating to ratify it and to do so once and for all.
Mr President, you said last weekend that you were not ready to put your European flag back in your pocket, and indeed we have seen that you have raised it under the Arc de Triomphe next to the French flag.
We interpret this symbolic gesture as proof of your determination to act in the service of the Community, and we thank you, Mr President.
<D>
(SK) I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Cizelj, for her excellent and inspiring report.
The adverse energy situation in the world, the EU's high dependence on energy imports and the rise in greenhouse gas emissions all mean that nuclear energy, despite its many ideological opponents, is receiving more attention at EU level and has already become an integral part of the energy mix of some European countries.
In this context the Euratom Supply Agency has to face these challenges with a view to offering its customers comprehensive and effective services with a high degree of flexibility and access to supply sources.
Allow me to touch briefly on three aspects that are fundamental to the fulfilment of this Agency's mandate.
First of all, I would like to mention the Agency's tasks.
I fully agree with the rapporteur that its tasks should be more clearly defined, in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty and the objectives of a common policy on security of supply of nuclear materials in a renewed energy context.
My second point relates to the Agency itself.
The new Agency Statutes proposed by the Commission seem at first glance to be sufficiently effective with regard to both the organisational structure, for example the reduction in the number of members of the Advisory Committee, and the budget.
Taking into account, however, the Agency's overall role, it should maintain a high level of competences in order to perform its mission in monitoring evaluations, proposing recommendations and conducting specific market studies.
The Agency should have staff with a high level of expertise from the industry at its disposal, with broad experience of the market and fuel cycle operations.
In the area of inter-institutional relationships the European Parliament should receive on a regular basis any important reports from the Agency, which would also increase the transparency of its activities and budget.
The third point concerns the transparency surrounding the financing of the Agency.
Despite the fact that the Agency was established on the basis of the Euratom Treaty, as a legal entity with a high degree of financial autonomy, its relationship to the Commission creates a complex and opaque financial mechanism, allowing only limited access to financial information.
<D>
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (PT) A few days ago, I received an email from a lobbyist selling body scanners.
This email spoke of the 'post-Detroit era'.
No surprise there.
Each machine cost EUR 250 000.
There is a fortune to be made by selling body scanners, but in reading the email and thinking about this post-Detroit era, after an amateur attempt made by a terrorist who was overpowered by other passengers on the plane, I asked myself whether this attack really merited having an historical era named after it.
It did not, unless it refers to the era of sheer effrontery.
Not everything can serve as an excuse to increase the levels of intrusion into the private lives of members of the public.
European citizens also need to know that we in Parliament have a responsibility.
Yes, we do indeed need to investigate terrorism.
It is true that the police always need more data, as do airports, but it is also important to base research on clear assumptions, and there are many assumptions being made by the Council and the Commission.
I am sorry to say that these are incorrect.
The idea that the terrorist threat has not diminished is debatable and should be debated here.
The idea that terrorism is evolving and that we should evolve too is true, but the first thing is to do our jobs well, because the Detroit attack, or rather the attempted attack, could very easily have been prevented.
Now we find ourselves debating the databases and police practices of the future.
When they discover that terrorists can ingest the materials for making bombs, will they start doing endoscopies at airports?
Is this where we want to end up?
There comes a time when this House has to sit down and discuss this matter carefully, with respect for the rights of the public.
<D>
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, I would like to speak on behalf of my colleague Mr Blokland.
In previous weeks it has become clear in the media that since the accession of Romania to the European Union, 500 000 Romanians have already moved to Italy.
There is therefore a great deal of free movement of people within the European Union even without the application of the Schengen acquis.
I am therefore very concerned about the controls on undesirable persons crossing our internal borders.
Italy's decision to turn away European citizens is an extreme measure that clearly shows that open borders can also have negative consequences.
Specific controls will therefore be necessary.
That is possible at the borders, but controls can also be carried out at airports and railway stations.
For this reason it is necessary for a functional SIS to be operational in the short term.
Can the Commission, in its Schengen assessment, also focus on the free movement of people from countries that belong to the Union but not to the Schengen area?
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, I want to warmly thank Anja Weisgerber as the rapporteur on behalf of the committee and, of course, as a member of my own group who, once again, I think, has shown her mastery of complex, technical dossiers, having also worked very effectively on a number of the emission dossiers as rapporteur for the opinion.
But I am delighted now that she has her own report, and I congratulate her on the very thorough way that she has approached this important task.
I know how much work is involved, having been the rapporteur myself on the overall Type Approval Directive.
I also want to thank Günter Verheugen and his team in the Commission for moving very quickly and in a timely way to give us this important proposal, which will effectively incorporate into the master Type Approval Directive the specific requirements for hydrogen vehicles.
I think, by the way, that shows the important of finally having now achieved this common type approval framework for motor vehicles, that we have the flexibility to be able to respond and include these new developments in it.
In that connection, I just want to emphasise what a number of colleagues have said already, but particularly from my perspective, having worked with the Commission as a Member of this Parliament on the Cars 21 group, which was formed to put in place a competitive automotive regulatory strategy for the 21st century - that is what Cars 21 meant - and this is clearly a 21st-century proposal.
But the important thing is that it gives the manufacturing industry - but not just the big manufacturers, the many companies who are involved in developing the systems and components that will help move forward the hydrogen-powered vehicles - it will give them a clear legislative framework within which to work now.
They do not have to wait for it.
That is a huge benefit, and it means that we will have one framework for Europe - one framework - and that means that, if you then comply with those requirements, you can sell your vehicle everywhere else.
But, actually, this is not enough, and I am pleased that Anja has included in her report a specific request to the Commission to say, 'We want to make hydrogen vehicle safety requirements global requirements.
Across the world people are working on hydrogen vehicle standards.
It is absolutely the right time to put that into the global vehicle working party, because we should start as we mean to go on and have that set of global standards for hydrogen vehicles.
At the same time, we want Europe to be a leader in developing those technologies, and we can achieve both with the foundation of this proposal.
<D>
(FR) Mr President, Mr Evans, I have noted your comments on the Geneva process, and it is true that the Norwegians are playing a prominent role in it.
However, I believe that the weight of the Union, which, I must reiterate is the largest donor, is particularly important.
We must therefore use all of that weight to influence the Geneva process and the stabilisation operations in the country.
The conditions for granting GSP Plus to Sri Lanka are primarily based on economic vulnerability criteria and on the fact that the international conventions that I mentioned concerning fundamental rights must be applied.
Indeed, Sri Lanka also has to apply for the arrangement.
As far as I am aware, although I am not certain, we need to receive an overall dossier from the Sri Lankan authorities before we can decide whether or not we can grant GSP Plus.
At this stage I am not aware of any reluctance on the part of the Council to grant it.
We will have to look at the exact nature of the request from the Sri Lankan authorities.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - (CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission agrees with the analysis by Mr Van Hecke, and I would like to reassure him that the Commission is very active in its efforts to fight child abuse.
Children's rights are among the main priorities of the Commission's Strategic Objectives for 2005-2009.
This priority was expressed in the 2006 Commission communication 'Towards an EU strategy on the rights of the child', and recently in the Commission communication 'A Special Place for Children in EU external action', adopted on 5 February 2008.
The aim of the recently adopted communication is to create a framework for a common EU approach to protecting and promoting the rights of the child in third countries, which would be reflected in all areas of our external relations including development assistance, humanitarian aid and trade policy.
The Action plan on children's rights in EU external action, included with this communication, identifies the main priority areas requiring action at regional and global level: child labour, child trafficking, violence against children, including sexual violence, and children affected by armed conflicts.
In order to implement these policies, the Commission will make use of the EUR 25 million from the thematic programme 'Investing in people' to support initiatives in the following areas: child trafficking, children affected by armed conflicts, sexual and reproductive health, and rights of young people.
The Commission will continue to support, within the framework of the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights, projects implementing the EU's basic principles of supporting and protecting the rights of the child, and the principles concerning children affected by armed conflicts.
Although the Lisbon Treaty has not yet been ratified, it is worth mentioning that it stipulates that in its relations with the wider world, the Union shall contribute to the protection of human rights, in particular the rights of the child.
In so doing the Union gives priority in its external policy to the issue of human rights of probably the most vulnerable group in society.
<D>
The objective presented in the Millennium Development Goal programme is very noble and I think that we must make every effort to achieve it.
Lithuania is a small country with a limited bilateral development budget.
Global aims are complex and sometimes unattainable for us.
Most of our bilateral aid (around 50%) is directed towards countries which are part of the European Neighbourhood Policy.
That is not because we are any less concerned about populations in Africa or the Caribbean than we are about people closer to home.
For Lithuania and countries in a similar situation, the important thing is not the small allocation of funds but its effectiveness.
As far as possible, we need to achieve better results with relatively few resources and that is not always possible to achieve in far off countries.
It is important for us to help where we can, if not through the funds, then by sharing our experience of integration and other research that could be useful.
Poverty reduction, whether in Lithuania or the furthest corner of Africa, should be one of our greatest priorities.
The fight against corruption and aid for the poorest - that is our moral duty and a long-term interest of the EU.
There has been a rise in the number of people who are underemployed or whose jobs are insecure and therefore, it is important for us to direct all of our efforts towards protecting, above all, the interests of the most vulnerable groups.
<D>
Mr President, science and technology have been identified by the African Union as crucial contributors to sustainable development on the African continent.
Currently nearly all African countries are lagging behind with regard to scientific output and scientific capacity.
Take scientific publications as one indicator.
Egypt, as one of the strongest African countries in this area, accounts for a mere 0.4% share of global publications.
Scientific collaboration and cooperation offers the chance to overcome the extreme disparities in development.
However, it faces considerable challenges in areas such as global sustainability problems like poverty, climate change, biodiversity, HIV/AIDS, infectious diseases, energy, clean water - the list is seemingly endless.
Add to that the brain drain, the problem of free circulation of scientists and limited access to information.
Currently there are more opportunities than ever to collaborate successfully with African partners.
Examples of these are in the areas of biotechnology, ICT, space and nanotechnologies.
Coupled with Africa's rich natural resources and biodiversity, these could prove highly effective.
In addition a renewed political commitment in Africa and a greater commitment of industrialised countries including China are essential for any further development in this area.
Over the past 20 years the EU has gathered considerable experience regarding the organisation and management of collaborative S&T programmes.
FP7 offers some very interesting opportunities to partners from Africa but more can be done.
We have to realise the full potential that cooperation on matters of science has to offer African countries and the development of the African continent.
The fields of science and technology can and must do more.
We must create broad channels of communication and networks between scientists and development practitioners to learn from each other.
The concept of science diplomacy is back at the top of the agenda and must be adapted for a new era of the internet, of low-cost travel, 24-hour global news, the power of NGOs - a long list.
The fact that science is and must remain outside the realm of politics makes scientists trusted diplomats.
It is time for the scientific community to increase its role in diplomacy.
A vigorous new science diplomacy oriented to African citizens as well as to their governments will provide human well-being, education, economic growth and above all hope.
A diplomacy of deeds and not just words.
The Millennium Development Goals look increasingly challenging in this year of science with Africa.
<D>
I welcome the report from my colleague on the role played by the Internet in boosting trade.
In view of the ever-growing number of Internet users, better regulation needs to be put in place in this expanding area.
European policies must encourage e-commerce as an effective alternative to the conventional method of doing business and as a way of boosting cross-border trade within the EU.
A series of Community measures is required to eliminate the potential obstacles hampering better use of the Internet for commercial purposes.
This includes measures designed to discourage and prevent fraud and theft of personal data.
These Community measures must also encourage users to have greater trust in the online environment.
At the same time, Community standards must be defined for e-commerce transactions.
The EU needs to facilitate the implementation of these standards, thereby offering e-commerce agents the opportunity to be recognised as reliable suppliers.
Thanks to the global nature of the Internet and the opportunity to carry out beneficial commercial transactions with third countries, I hope that we will see progress too within the WTO in terms of promoting e-commerce worldwide.
<D>
Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining with your rapporteur in emphasising the importance of logistics, not only from the economic point of view but also environmentally and socially.
I think it is unanimously agreed that logistics should be developed and made more efficient, more environmentally friendly.
That is made very clear in the report by Mrs Ayala Sender, which I welcome.
A number of the wishes you have expressed, which I have listened to very carefully this afternoon, will be incorporated in the Action Plan for Logistics that will be coming out by the end of October.
Since I really do not have enough time to reply at length, I shall just refer to the rules on the size of lorries.
That is certainly one of the most controversial issues and we shall not be able to debate it fully today.
I shall simply make a few comments.
It is a fact that, although we hope to see much more of a modal shift in the future, at present most goods are carried by road.
We have to assess any measures that might improve the efficiency of that mode of transport and reduce its impact on the environment.
The assessment should also cover the rules on the size of lorries, Directive 96/53.
I think any amendments have to be considered very carefully, because they might have complex repercussions.
We need to examine the effects that wider or heavier lorries might have on the infrastructure, safety, the environment, the system of shippers and carriers, and intermodal competition.
As I said, I feel that we should give these questions very serious consideration.
My services will therefore be embarking on research to evaluate experiences.
On the basis of its results, we shall be able to discuss all the nuances of this very important issue, which must not be treated lightly.
That is my first point and I shall wind up very quickly, too quickly for my liking, but I appreciate that Parliament has a timetable.
The second important issue in the work on logistics is infrastructures.
Reference has been made to the financing of infrastructures.
I should like to draw attention to the new Marco Polo II Programme, which will enable us to finance logistical solutions favouring the modal shift or the reduction in traffic.
Finally, training.
The last speaker, Mr Rack, said that a new culture has to be developed.
That is indeed what is necessary and we always come back to the men and women working in the transport business, who need to master a whole range of new skills if transport is really to be made more efficient and mobility more sustainable, in other words more environmentally friendly.
I thank Parliament very much and I shall take full account of this report and the subsequent debate.
<D>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in spite of the good atmosphere in which we worked on the Second Strategic Energy Review, I regret to say that we did not manage to obtain the corrections to the Commission's proposal that I believed necessary.
To my mind, the title 'Strategic Energy Review' has strong connotations of building for the future.
If we take a look at this review, however, we have to conclude that it is all very much rooted in the past.
At the heart of this strategic energy plan - and I am afraid the Laperrouze report does not put this right either - is the old energy mix of coal and nuclear power, and indeed there is an extremely sharp focus on the nuclear pillar once again.
I do wonder, Commissioner Piebalgs, what has happened to the proposals you presented to us at the start of this legislative term, when you told us that the great risks associated with nuclear energy had to be brought under control, that the problem of nuclear waste, the funding of decommissioning and all these issues had to be resolved before the Commission made any positive moves towards the development of nuclear energy.
Not one of these issues has been resolved, and yet the Commission is now launching this pro-nuclear offensive.
The fact that one of the greatest debacles in the history of the Western European nuclear industry is taking place right now in Finland, that the amount in dispute between the Finnish electricity company and Areva has now reached EUR 2.4 billion, because so many extra costs have arisen at the Olkiluoto site, does not seem to worry you in the least.
What, I wonder, is the sense of this new investment drive in a sector which, despite receiving decades of public investment - far exceeding the volume staked in all the other sectors - is once again producing this kind of mess.
I would very much like to know whether you actually mean all of this seriously or whether other hands are pulling the strings.
In my view, this mix of coal and nuclear power is precisely the strategy that has driven the energy policy of the European Union up a blind alley.
I have said enough about nuclear power, but the wasteful use of fossil fuels - something else that the review does not really address at all - has also contributed to the present climate disaster, and the essential adjustments to this outdated strategy of yesteryear are not being made in this review.
In the deliberations on Mrs Laperrouze's report, my group established clear priorities.
It goes without saying that nuclear power was not one of them, but we tried to bring about real changes in other areas too.
We wanted the target of a 20% reduction in the consumption of primary energy to be made binding at long last.
That did not happen.
We expect a realistic proposal for the development of the 'supergrid', in other words a network that must be able to incorporate really large capacities for the generation of energy from renewable sources by the North Sea, in other coastal areas or in southern desert regions.
There was no real sign of any of these things at all in either the report or the Commission's proposal.
We also believe that it was a big mistake to leave the whole realm of transport out of this strategic planning process on energy, because we - like you - want to get away from dependence on oil.
You have decided that transport matters should be discussed separately, but in our opinion this issue should be one of the key focal points of strategic energy planning.
Diversifying gas supplies is all very well, and it is certainly something we should do, but at the same time every effort should be made to ensure once and for all that gas is used efficiently, otherwise diversification will get us nowhere at the end of the day.
I was appalled last week to learn that the European Commission's Recovery Plan is revisiting all of these strategic distortions and adopting the same backward-looking approach as this Strategic Energy Review.
I must announce on behalf of my group that we shall be supporting neither the Laperrouze report nor the Strategic Energy Review and that we shall also endeavour in the context of the Recovery Plan to argue the case for sustainability and common sense.
<D>
Madam President, I think Mr Barroso really does have, today, a most difficult role.
It is one of the most difficult jobs in the European Union that he has to do.
He has to divide his time between reasoning with the Left and with the Right - with people who have the best answers to the most difficult problems.
Mr Barroso has to manoeuvre artfully between these propositions.
I think the best of these is the 2020 Strategy, which has been proposed by the Commission.
I am surprised by the proposals which have been made in this Chamber, according to which the way to repair the present, very difficult, situation is to repeat our mistakes.
I would like to say that I spent 18 years of my life in a country which was called the People's Republic of Poland, in which there was a Ministry of Internal Trade and where the shelves in the shops were empty.
There was a Ministry of Internal Trade, but there was no internal trade.
Today, and for 20 years now, for which I praise God, we do not have a Ministry of Internal Trade in Poland and we do have internal trade.
I would like to say that the remedy for the current crisis certainly is not greater regulation, nor is it higher taxes or more intervention.
I am not, of course, a free-market fanatic.
I think the role of the state is to correct market mechanisms, but this should be done very carefully.
If we want to talk honestly about development in Europe, let us remember how we voted on the Services Directive in the last parliamentary term.
Let us remember what happened to the Services Directive in this Chamber.
For without the free flow of persons, services and capital, Europe will not be able to compete effectively with the world's other continents.
We are hearing here, today, that we cannot compete with other regions of political and economic integration, but surely it is we ourselves who are forcing our continent's entrepreneurs to go elsewhere by excessive regulation and placing excessive burdens on businesses.
Let us, therefore, ask ourselves what more we could do to support the 2020 strategy, because there is no other, and of course we do have to get out of the crisis.
There is also no doubt that we must help Greece.
For us Poles, whom I represent here, the word 'solidarity' has great significance.
We must, therefore, show our solidarity with Greece today.
I want to emphasise yet again that we must do everything possible for Europe to recover from the economic crisis, because it is not only a problem faced by millions of families, but it is also a problem of faith in our future.
I have faith in the future of Europe, I believe in our success.
<D>
Yes, the Council is aware of the incidents that the Member refers to.
The Presidency would like to say that, as a candidate country, Turkey has to share the European Union's values and goals in accordance with the treaties.
A clear commitment to good neighbourly relations and peaceful solutions to conflicts is a crucial and important requirement for EU membership.
In accordance with the framework for the negotiations and relevant Council conclusions, the EU has urged Turkey to avoid any kind of threats, sources of conflict or measures that could harm good relations and the possibility of resolving disputes in a peaceful manner.
I would like to assure the honourable Member that the issue of good neighbourly relations is brought up by the EU on a systematic basis, most recently at the Association Council meeting on 19 May and at the meeting between the EU troika and Turkey's political leaders in Stockholm in July this year.
As regards the particular point about aircraft operated by Frontex, I would like to mention that Frontex is coordinating several joint operations and pilot projects.
These are an important contribution to the protection of the Union's sea, land and external air borders.
One of the operations is Poseidon 2009, for which Greece is the host.
It is aimed at preventing impermissible border crossings by persons coming from or transiting Turkey and countries in North Africa and trying to reach the Greek coast.
The honourable Member is, of course, aware of this.
Poseidon also includes the stationing of technical facilities in European airspace along the borders of the Greek islands.
Turkey has, of course, been informed of the operation.
With regard to operational cooperation between Frontex and the competent Turkish authorities, negotiations are currently being conducted concerning working methods.
That is very positive.
An agreement would cover information exchange and opportunities for the Turkish authorities to take part in Frontex joint operations.
This sort of work could be an important part of the work to prevent illegal immigration and could help to improve neighbourly relations.
<D>
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I would like to thank Thijs Berman for his report.
It points out an important aspect in development aid that the Commission should, in my opinion, seriously consider.
Activities such as cultural, scientific and economic exchange programmes, citizen-to-citizen contacts or political dialogue are regrettably not covered by existing European legislation, those being just a few examples.
The European Union has set up numerous programmes and financial instruments under the auspices of different agencies, each covering only certain limited aspects of the problems that the developing countries are currently facing.
I find that, without a central European Union agency and a comprehensive and coherent policy, the efforts that we are making to improve the situation in developing countries are not of notable extent.
We all agree that the purpose of the European Union development cooperation policy is to reach as many people in need as possible, but yet we have chosen a rather inconvenient path to that goal.
At the moment, the European Union is both institutionally fragmented and legally hindered as far as development aid is concerned.
This much appreciated report deals with the results of those deficiencies.
The European Union and its Member States have contributed immensely to the official development assistance and it should never be underestimated, but much remains to be done to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the institutional framework as well as congruence of the legislation covering development aid.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the proposal to transfer Taiwan to the positive visa list was adopted by the Commission on 5 July this year.
Taiwan is, as we all know, a well-developed and stable democracy.
It meets all the necessary technical requirements.
The proposal is a result of a periodic review of the visa list and based on suggestions coming from Member States.
The Commission assesses a variety of conditions: irregular migration, public policy, public security, reciprocity, regional coherence and the external relations of the European Union.
We need to reinforce regional coherence in south-eastern Asia.
Other similar developed third countries, such as Hong Kong, Macao, Japan, South Korea and Singapore, are already visa-free.
In addition, a process has unarguably been set in motion regarding relations between Taiwan and mainland China, which is also proven by the establishment of direct flights and the conclusion of an economic cooperation framework agreement between them.
As was said by the rapporteur and Mr Kovatchev, the United Kingdom, Ireland, New Zealand and South Korea have already granted visa-free travel to Taiwanese citizens, and Canada is currently in the process of exempting Taiwan from the visa obligation.
Any visa waiver granted to the citizens of Taiwan should, of course, be reciprocated.
Taiwan has progressively eliminated visa requirements for nationals of a large majority of EU Member States, and has committed itself to granting a full visa regime for all EU citizens.
Romanian, Bulgarian and Cypriot citizens will be free to travel to Taiwan without a visa as from 11 November - which is tomorrow, so you can book your tickets!
Furthermore, Taiwan will extend the allowed period for EU citizens to remain in Taiwan to 90 days on the entry into force of the EU visa waiver.
The proposal also covers the deletion of the Northern Mariana Islands from the negative list, since the territory forms part of the US.
Visa freedom and visa liberalisation is a great way of bringing people together, closer to each other: students, researchers, ordinary people, the business community, researchers and others.
This is a very important decision that we are about to take.
Procedurally, this is codecision - as you know - but I am glad to inform you that the Council members have already expressed their very broad support for this.
As I understand, and thanks to the work of the rapporteur, Mr Díaz de Mera, and the shadow rapporteurs, there is also very strong support in this Parliament so I hope there will be a good vote tomorrow.
There was only one amendment to the Commission proposal, proposed both in the Council and in the European Parliament, aiming to exclude the 60 000 so-called Overseas Taiwanese nationals.
The rapporteur and Member States in the Council were of the view that these people need prior authorisation from Taiwan to enter their own country.
Therefore, it would be a logical and reasonable step for the EU to exclude this category from the visa waiver.
The Commission accepts this amendment.
I would like to thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs for their excellent support and cooperation on this file.
I am sure that the full reciprocal visa waiver will give a boost to the very good relations between the EU and Taiwan in various sectors, such as tourism and trade, and benefit all parties.

on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, I am from Martinique and have always lived in the Caribbean.
Believe me, Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Economic Partnership Agreement between the Caribbean Forum of African, Caribbean and Pacific States and the European Union is a matter of great concern to me.
Martinique, Guadeloupe and Guyana are outermost European regions and therefore the Caribbean as a whole has not been taken into account.
In my opinion, this agreement has been negotiated mainly for the purposes of trade, and the Millennium Development Goals have been relegated to second place, once again.
The challenge for the Caribbean countries, therefore, will be to make up the losses in customs revenue by increasing the volume of trade with the European Union.
At this time of global recession, that may not be easy.
Facts are facts and these agreements have been negotiated primarily by the Directorate-General for Trade and within this Parliament the Committee on Development seems to me to have been somewhat sidelined.
In this agreement, the stated objectives in relation to development and integration at regional level are not in accordance with the measures deployed to achieve them.
These measures relate, for the most part, only to trade and competitiveness.
As for regional integration, there too, there is a mismatch between the intended goals and the resources used.
I come now more specifically to the regional integration of the outermost regions (ORs) of the Caribbean in their environment.
The ORs are at the heart of a 'living basin'.
Guyana even has one of its main borders with Suriname.
The ORs have more than 35 million inhabitants spread over 40 countries and cover more than two million square kilometres.
That is a huge potential market.
This agreement was an opportunity to reduce the impact of certain so-called structural handicaps, such as remoteness, for example, in favour of the closeness between our islands.
Why have we dispensed with negotiating a specific interregional market between the outermost regions of the European Union and Cariforum?
At a time when the European Commission is concerned about addressing the underdevelopment of the Caribbean countries and establishing EPAs with this group for the purpose of opening up markets and regional integration, the outermost region of the Caribbean is taken into account only to become a part of the Cariforum open market and it remains stuck in the same market principles as were negotiated for the whole of the European Union.
These principles can put us at a disadvantage.
This was a chance to promote a dialogue between cultures, the forming of cooperation, exchange of services and bringing the outermost regions...
(The President cut off the speaker)
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, new technologies are gaining ever greater weight in Europe's cultural industry.
Particular attention must therefore be given to protecting intellectual property.
The task of the European Union, and of the Member States, should be to provide the necessary resources to ensure that intellectual property rights are respected and protected.
Combating piracy is particularly important in this regard.
All those involved should be aware of their rights and obligations regarding a common solution to this task.
In its report, our committee has argued in favour of awareness-raising and education campaigns, particularly with regard to consumers.
Preparatory and education measures explaining the value of intellectual property should start among young people in schools.
In this context I should like to emphasise once again the committee's opinion that criminalising consumers who are not seeking to make a profit is not the right solution to combating digital piracy.
We have repeatedly emphasised that free information structures such as the World Wide Web are of great significance to the European creative sector and that we have to strike a balance between the openness of the Internet and the protection of intellectual property.
In this context, Mr President, allow me one final comment on the revised version of Amendment 22a tabled by 40 Members.
My group - the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats - has clearly stated that it is prepared to support the first part of the amendment, and to emphatically reject the second part of this amendment.
<D>
Mr President, the Committee on Regional Development and the funds put into the whole of Europe are the most important programme in the whole of the European Community.
I can speak for North-West England and say how very much these funds have benefited the city of Liverpool, in particular, over the last 10 years.
Looking onward to the future, I can see that city continuing to expand on the basis of these well-allocated, well-controlled funds.
I would call for more involvement of the private sector in the way that the funds are allocated, managed and controlled, because the private sector can always do a more efficient job than the public sector.
I would also like to emphasise how very invaluable these monies have been to the rural areas of the North West, where there are a lot of agricultural areas, which are vital to the whole economy.
Finally, let me say that I back Mr Becsey on his microcredit.
This is a very interesting development and essential at this time in the economic situation.
<D>
I voted for this report in the belief that, based on the assent given by the EP to the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) between the CARIFORUM countries, of the one part, and the European Union and its Member States, of the other part, this will guarantee that:
the implementation of commitments in areas not yet regulated under the CARICOM Single Market and Economy (CSME) or fully implemented, including financial services, other services, investment, competition, public procurement, e-commerce, intellectual property, free circulation of goods and the environment, will be deferred pending completion of the single market and economy in these areas;
an independent monitoring mechanism will be established within the CARIFORUM States, equipped with the necessary resources to undertake the analysis required to determine the extent to which the EPA is achieving its objectives;
there is an early determination and provision of an equitable share of the Aid for Trade resources.
These funds represent additional resources and not merely repackaging of EDF funding;
they comply with CARIFORUM priorities and that their disbursement will be timely, predictable and in line with the execution schedules for national and regional strategic development plans.
These funds should be used efficiently to compensate the loss of customs revenues.
<D>
(PL) Prime Minister, we listened to your speech with great care and would like to express the hope that the most important points of the programme will be put into effect successfully.
I would like, however, to draw attention to three challenges.
The first of these is European solidarity, which is especially important at a time of financial crisis.
We cannot allow situations to arise in which particular European countries are treated unequally.
We cannot accept a situation in which some are allowed to subsidise their banking sector and others are condemned for attempting to strengthen their shipbuilding sector.
That is not solidarity, that is hypocrisy.
Secondly, we are glad that the Baltic Sea Strategy is one of the priorities of the Swedish Presidency.
This is an important area of macroregional cooperation.
The Baltic ecosystem should be protected from hazards such as the very unsafe, and also financially absurd, Nord Stream project.
The need for diversification of energy sources should also be mentioned.
Thirdly, let us remember that Moscow does not restrict itself to turning off the tap, as Georgia discovered.
I hope that, as Sweden takes the helm of the European Union for the next six months, it will be as resolute as Minister Carl Bildt, who condemned the Russian aggression against Georgia.
I am sure that the Swedish Presidency will be equal to these challenges.
It can count on our support.
<D>
The repression which has recently been used against activists of the Polish minority in Belarus is part of a much wider problem.
The Belarusian authorities do not tolerate any independence.
They do not want, and they do not accept, the idea of civil society.
Every manifestation of independence is treated as political opposition.
This is not, therefore, an internal conflict in a non-governmental organisation, and neither is it a Polish-Belarusian conflict.
It is, rather, an expression of the consistent stance of the Belarusian authorities, which are attempting to prevent liberalisation and democratisation.
It is a pity that in Poland, there are political forces which are trying to use the situation to achieve their own, particular goals, and are using events in Belarus to discredit the policy of the Polish Government.
Politicians who behave in this way surely do not understand that they are doing exactly what Lukashenko expects.
It is in his interests to polarise and divide public opinion in Poland and Europe.
Repudiation of Polish and European policy towards Belarus is an abuse of freedom, and is detrimental to the effectiveness of joint action for freedom and democracy in Belarus.
Thank you very much.
<D>
in writing. - (FR) France is very concerned about the European Union's policy on the outermost regions.
It is essential that the specific characteristics of these regions be taken into account, much more and much better than they are now, by the politicians in Brussels, especially:
through trade policy, as production by the outermost regions is in competition with that of the neighbouring countries that benefit from highly preferential conditions from the EU;
through immigration policy, as these regions are particularly vulnerable to immigration and the influx of illegal immigrants is creating economic and social problems there that are far beyond the local capacity to overcome them;
through provisions concerning State aid and especially by maintaining the tax exemptions that these regions benefit from, which are periodically called into question in the name of European law.
I am particularly worried about the legal ambiguity that exists regarding Saint-Barthélemy: this small French island has been a territorial authority since 2007, and when it changed its status it wanted to preserve the tax exemption that is essential for its economic survival.
However, the EU appears to consider it to be among the outermost regions, in other words a territory of the Union that is subject to Community law.
It would be unacceptable for this ambiguity to put at risk the desire for autonomy that was clearly expressed by 95% of the population.
<D>
Subject: Sale of the Hellenic Telecommunications Organisation (OTE) and refusal to make a public takeover bid
The Hellenic Parliament has adopted a law ratifying the agreement between OTE and Deutsche Telekom without regard to the provisions of Directive 2004/25/EChttp://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides concerning the protection of minority shareholders.
In refusing to take those provisions into account, the government based its argument on Article 8(g) of Law 3461/2006, which exempts government-owned enterprises which are in the process of privatisation from the takeover bid requirement.
Given that the government owned only 28% of OTE before the agreement, does the Commission consider that OTE was a government enterprise?
What is the minimum percentage stake that the government must hold in an enterprise for that enterprise to be considered government-owned?
Does the exemption provided by the above law protect the rights of minority shareholders?
Are the principles of clarity and transparency respected at Community level in the case of public takeover bids?
In the Member States, do the shareholders of companies in which the government has a stake have fewer rights than those of other companies in which the government has no stake?
<D>
rapporteur. - (SV) Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Nečas for his engagement in this debate here this evening.
I would also like to thank Mr Rehn for raising the bilateral disputes which have become de facto European problems and for stressing how important it is for us not to sacrifice enlargement as a result of the financial crisis.
Bilateral disputes are currently holding back Croatia's and Macedonia's chances of continuing along the path to EU membership as they implement the necessary reforms.
With my report, the European Parliament will add its voice to the chorus of those insisting that bilateral disputes must remain precisely that - bilateral - and not be confused with the accession process.
Finally, I would like to say that I believe that enlargement to the Western Balkans is too important for peace, freedom and prosperity on our own continent for us to jeopardise it.
This is the message that I would like my report to send out to the 500 million Europeans who are soon to choose a new Parliament, to the governments of the Member States, to the Commission and to the people and politicians in the Western Balkans.
It is a message that is particularly important to send out at a time when the economic crisis is in danger of leading to ever more people and politicians in Europe wanting to close the door behind themselves and not allow any more people to live, work and trade where they want to on our continent.
I also hope, therefore, that this is a message that my fellow Members of this Parliament will take out with them in the forthcoming election campaign.
If Europe has become colder and more inward-looking, then it is a priority task for us in this House to work to make it welcoming and open once again.
<D>
(PT) In her speech, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner summarised the objectives of the new Union.
In truth, this Union was born during the French Presidency under the star sign of mistakes.
The first mistake was to remove from its agenda the conflicts in the region, particularly the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the Western Sahara conflict.
The second mistake is for the Union to try and assert itself by sharing economic and environmental projects, without questioning the free trade context in which it sits.
The third mistake is to insinuate that there is a possibility of transferring to this Union Turkey's application for accession to the European Union.
Mrs Napoletano's report does not tackle the first mistake, and that limits its scope.
No economic and regional integration will come to fruition if the Union does not have the courage to tackle existing conflicts and to do this based on international law.
On the other hand, the report does contain clear recommendations on the second and third mistakes, and these are all heading in the right direction.
The Union for the Mediterranean cannot act as the waiting room or back door for Turkey, provided that it meets the accession criteria, and the Union for the Mediterranean cannot be an add-on to the European free trade strategy, without any social integration policies.
The report's recommendations are important: a Union with a citizen and representative dimension involving the League of Arab States; regional projects with a social dimension; and the extension of projects to areas essential to people's lives, namely water, agriculture and education.
There are also clear rules on the programme agreements and a Euro-Mediterranean Investment Bank.
The Union was born with mistakes, but at least it exists.
I support this report because I believe that this Union will end up being what we manage to make of it.
I therefore give it the benefit of my support.
<D>
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commission President, ladies and gentlemen, with an annual strategy we have the choice of two paths.
The first would be maximum clarity and consistency between statements and financial action.
This would be particularly appropriate in an election year, because we are indeed promising that we will be - I quote -'Putting the Citizen First'.
Citizens are entitled to clarity.
The Commission, however, has unfortunately chosen the second path instead, namely to remain as general as possible in order to cover up opposition.
First of all the context itself is interesting.
We have to expect that the Treaty of Lisbon will be implemented.
We are in an election year and we are in a year in which Europe has also very extensively committed itself internationally to climate protection.
Unfortunately, words have so far been followed by far too few actions and this has not been made sufficiently clear in strategy either.
If we remain as hesitant about practical measures as we are about car emissions, for instance, then Europe's credibility is at stake and we cannot afford this in the long run at international level in debates with our partners on the subject of climate protection.
This is a negative example of our yielding to major lobbies, as with the implementation of the emissions trading system in air traffic, where we have also acted too hesitantly and not energetically enough and have therefore not managed to introduce the necessary measures for reducing climate damage caused by air traffic with the required efficiency.
There is also a conflict between the ambitious targets and the actual funding of research.
When we talk on the one hand about new sources of energy, but on the other hand about still assigning the lion's share of research funds to nuclear power, to the nuclear economy, this conflict cannot be resolved, nor should we then expect any sustainable solution, because there are no opportunities here whatsoever for investing in a truly concerted manner.
What I think this strategy lacks is a clear commitment to implementing Community law in the Member States.
There are far too few mechanisms here; there is far too little regard for the law.
In fact, the opposite is true: we are developing new plans before the old ones have been implemented.
Here I would simply refer you back to the energy action plan.
If citizens are so important to us, as you rightly stress, then their grievances, among other things, as well as the new opportunity for a referendum, must be the focus of our attention in this House.
<D>
The least one can say is that the 'generally positive' assessment drawn up by the rapporteurs on ten years of Economic and Monetary Union does not seem completely objective.
Not surprisingly, the few problems identified are analysed as being the fault of the Member States and of a lack of European integration.
The truth is that the introduction of the euro automatically led to an explosion in the prices of convenience goods and to a fall in the purchasing power of workers.
The truth is that the Stability Pact is a budgetary and social Malthusianism.
The truth is that the lack of an exchange rate policy and the overvaluation of the euro have undermined the international competitiveness of the euro area.
The truth is that a single monetary policy and a single key interest rate for 11 or 15 economies with very different structures and levels of development are inevitably as ill-suited to the needs of each individual one of these economies as they are to those of the whole.
The euro has failed to bring the promised prosperity to its members, who, for the most part, are now in recession.
This is because the euro, in its conception and in its operation, is not an economic tool.
It is above all a powerful political tool for destroying the independence of nations.
<D>
(ES) Mr President, this debate and the answers from the Commissioner have left no doubt that the Spanish and Andalucian authorities are highly sensitive to spillages of pollutants and maritime safety; these are important matters for the Spanish Government both in terms of its response, which was fairly immediate in terms of time and manner, and because it has embarked upon a series of very large-scale actions to resolve the problem and to avoid even worse disasters.
We have already talked about this.
Clearly the New Flame incident is not remotely a catastrophe on the scale of the Prestige, but its consequences have occupied and concerned the Spanish Government, the government of my country.
The Spanish Government certainly cannot be accused of inaction, quite the reverse.
Right from the time of the incident, Spain has been in contact with the United Kingdom and with Gibraltar and has been seeking information on the vessel and on the collision, and it has offered to collaborate in and coordinate the initiative proposed by my fellow Member, Mr Meyer Pleite.
As the Commissioner said, assistance has been sought from the European Union since August.
The ship-owner and his company have been instructed to bear the cost of the damage and the Junta de Andalucía has also made a complaint to Gibraltar for potentially failing to comply with legislation.
It is vital for Spain to have fulfilled its obligations - which it did, and there was no repeat of what happened with the Prestige - but there is also a need for coordination and it is that coordination which was found wanting.
Therefore, I believe that Spain's recourse to the Forum of Dialogue on Gibraltar as a measure which can genuinely enable us to manage such situations and prevent further undesirable incidents should conclude this matter for us all.
Everything else is just the apathy which some people felt and want to drag through Parliament again.
<D>
(RO) Mr President, dear colleagues, the measure of simplifying the common milk market is, also from the Member States' perspective, a great initiative that brings the European Union closer to the farmers' real needs.
This is possible especially by liberalizing production and milk marketing.
This is good news especially for those countries whose farmers should make too large investments to produce just one of the 3 milk categories accepted until now.
I do not think that under the present market conditions farmers could have adapted their production by 2009, the end of the transition period.
Moreover, the European Union does not have to dictate the contents of milk products, as long as the phytosanitary standards are complied with.
That is why I totally agree with this liberalization measure.
Secondly, I support the introduction of one single rate of aid in the school-milk scheme.
This is an important measure that will contribute to social cohesion in Europe as poorer regions will be favoured, and to the fight against obesity among young people.
According to a Commission proposal, the aid should be higher because schools and kindergartens should not be forced to take part in financing a part of the cost.
Moreover, this amount will be an advantage especially for those states which already have an aid system in schools.
European funds can contribute to the quality of programmes and products provided to students and will remove significant budgetary resources of Member States, that could thus be used within the context of policies for young people.
I also support the creation of the European Fund for milk market restructuring.
It should also include a financing line for improving quality, according to which many farmers in the new Member States cannot sell their production any more after 2009.
Least but not last, we have to see the changes in the common market organisation in the wider context of health control under the common agriculture policy.
I think that this is the right time for restructuring the common milk market with the aim of removing the milk-quota system.
<D>
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (ES) Mr President, I must insist on one fundamental fact.
The European project will only have credibility if Europe is perceived as a place where every kind of discrimination is outlawed.
This is the basis for the today's debate.
Therefore, it is a surprise that some of my fellow Members, who are so pro-European in all other debates, turn completely anti-European when it comes to rights and liberties.
This attitude cannot be tolerated.
It is unacceptable that anyone should suffer discrimination in the European Union today, on the grounds of a same-sex relationship, disability, age, or for having a non-mainstream belief or religion, as has also been mentioned.
This is not the Europe in which I want to live, and is certainly not the Europe that I am working for every day, both inside and outside of this House.
For this reason, I believe the proposal for a directive was necessary.
In its conception and principles, it is good.
It may not be what I, or many of us here would have done, but it is a good starting point.
I hope that the majority will vote for the Buitenweg report tomorrow, as I intend to do, as I believe it to be the correct course of action.
I am also very anxious that the other item dealing with the implementation or re-implementation of Article 7(2) will be passed.
This guarantees a fundamental issue: that all associations and organisations working in the anti-discrimination field must also be allowed to represent and defend victims of discrimination.
We must remember that these persons form part of the most vulnerable groups, and we therefore need to have a guarantee that they can be represented and duly defended.
<D>
in writing. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am backing this report because I am convinced that free trade is a necessary step towards global well-being.
However, our support for any supranational economic agreement has to be dependent on stringent rules committing all parties to ratification of the fundamental ILO conventions, thereby guaranteeing that employees are safeguarded and protected.
As the rapporteur has recalled, ASEAN as a whole is the EU's fifth largest trading partner.
This highlights our many trading interests in that region, which is without doubt a rapidly growing market.
The region's strong presence, and the absence of effective local employment legislation, obliges us to ensure that the new agreement lays down robust rules not only of an economic nature but also, above all, as concerns employment, the environment and human rights, thereby limiting the effect of social dumping.
Product safety and the protection of employees and the environment cannot and must not be jeopardised by any kind of purely economic agreement.
All of us, united by identical values, have a moral and institutional duty to find the courage to be much more rigorous and selective in choosing our trading partners: all of our partners must provide Europe with guarantees that they set an example to other peoples around the world.
<D>
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FI) Mr President, Commissioner, the stock markets in the United States of America have crashed, the stock markets in the Member States of the European Union have crashed, and the stock markets in Russia have crashed.
We are all in the same crisis caused by turbocapitalism.
Despite that, some EU countries, taking their lead from the Baltic counties, whose presidents were educated in the United States, and especially Poland, want to isolate Russia from the European Community.
First the brakes were applied to the start of the talks on the Partnership Agreement, and today the reason is Georgia's and Abhasia's conflict with Russia.
In many Western countries the media has presented an image of Russia as the attacker.
That is the wrong image.
Shakashvili's army attacked and so triggered the global conflict.
He should not be rewarded for that.
In these matters the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in the European Parliament is, unfortunately, a prisoner of its own extremist elements.
Of course, Russia gained a military victory over Shakashvili's army, an army that was trained by the Americans and Israelis and armed by the Ukrainians.
It was a political overreaction to recognise South Osettia's amd Abhasia's independence.
Now Russia is taking the political consequences.
Our group, however, does not believe that isolating Russia should be one of them.
European capitalism needs Russia's natural resources, and Russia needs Europe's political experience of democracy, civil freedoms and the rule of law.
These goals will not be realised through political violence but through cooperation and dialogue.
That is probably what the talks going on today in Helsinki between Chiefs of Staff General Mike Mullen and Nikolai Makarov are about.
The EU, furthermore, should not boycott the dialogue.
We wish the positive attempts proposed by the country to hold the Presidency every success.
<D>
(EL) Mr President, the conclusion of the 2006 International Tropical Timber Agreement is an extremely positive development.
Furthermore, it reflects the consensus of 180 producer and consumer state governments and international organisations.
There is no doubt, then, about the importance of the objectives set out in the agreement.
We need only think of the harmful effects of illegal felling and deforestation, especially their contribution towards the greenhouse effect.
It is therefore essential to back the national policies of the producer countries for the sustainable use and exploitation of tropical forests, and to strengthen their ability to implement forest legislation and effectively combat illegal felling.
The matter of adequate funding to achieve the aims of the new agreement is of course crucial.
We in the EU are called on to ensure that only lawfully felled tropical timber is imported and distributed on the European market.
We must promote actions to inform and raise awareness among consumers.
Let us, however, consider whether voluntary programmes are enough, or whether legally binding rules and specifications need to be enacted in respect of lawful trade in tropical timber.
This objective must be pursued not only at international level, but also at the level of bilateral agreements covered by the FLEGT programme and the trade agreements under negotiation; in other words, free-trade agreements.
The EU-Ghana Agreement is an example that points the way to bilateral cooperation.
<D>
rapporteur. - Mr President, of all the fundamental rights granted to EU citizens, the one that helps unite all of us the most is the right of freedom of movement in the European Union.
That right, provided for in the Treaties, is implemented by Directive 2004/38/EC, which lays down both the conditions and the restrictions for EU citizens and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the EU.
As of 1 January 2006, over 8 million EU citizens have exercised this right to reside in another Member State, and millions more have used it to travel through the EU.
As the European Parliament rapporteur on the evaluation of this Directive, I must say that the concrete application of the right of free movement for our citizens is seriously undermined by Member States which erect dams in breach of the Treaties and of the Directive.
First, talking about the transposition by Member States, we can say it has been poor at best.
The Commission, along with two separate studies commissioned by Parliament, points to a series of problems, some of them being breaches of the core rights of EU citizens.
These problems are highlighted in my report.
There are many unjustified administrative burdens, particularly for third-country-national family members, which include: entry requirements and lengthy procedural delays; a lack of recognition of free movement rights for certain registered partners, including those in same-sex relationships; public policy exceptions to serve economic or security aims which ignore the principle of proportionality, resulting in abuses of expulsion orders; and discrimination against certain nationals and ethnic communities in relation to the rights they should be granted by the Directive.
Second, to those who chose to focus solely on abuses and misuses of this right, I agree that these issues are important, but I say that Article 35 of the Directive already provides Member States with the possibility to fight against those abuses, such as marriages of convenience or fraud - one just has to implement it.
I also want to mention that I have constructively cooperated with national parliaments, the Commission and the Committee on Legal Affairs rapporteur, Mrs Frassoni, who all share my concern over the aforementioned transposition problems and the need for all parties to help to resolve them immediately.
My report also calls for a number of measures aimed at providing solutions.
One of the most important and immediate steps that must be taken is the creation by the Commission of comprehensive transposition guidelines.
Those guidelines would serve to provide clarity in the interpretation of such notions as 'sufficient resources' and 'public security'.
Once this has been done, it will be up to the Member States to implement those guidelines, preferably by the end of 2009.
Discriminatory transitional agreements that restrict the movement of workers from Member States that joined the EU after 2004 must finally be repealed or revised.
More funding must be allocated to help local integration measures for EU citizens residing in other Member States and, finally, the Commission must not hesitate to open infringement proceedings against Member States who are not complying with the Directive.
We have to recognise that Member States need finally to correctly apply and transpose the Directive so that these and other problems are resolved expediently.
They should not try to escape their duties in ensuring free movement by asking for a revision to water down the Directive.
The European Parliament firmly opposes such revision and thanks the Commission for doing the same.
It is time for the Member States and the Council to ensure that Europe is a place where not only capital, services and goods, but also our citizens, can circulate.
Without free movement, there is no Europe.
Let me conclude by saying that I shall move a revised oral amendment to a footnote in my report in order to take away any excuse for those who oppose free movement on a nationalistic, racist or xenophobic basis, but who do not dare to declare it openly, to vote against my report.
With the roll-call vote tomorrow, we will see who supports Europe and European citizenship, free movement and citizens' rights without discrimination, and who does not.
<D>
(FR) Madam President, between 2007 and 2013, cohesion policy will be the main item of expenditure for the Europe of Brussels, but far from benefiting the French regions, this development actually penalises them.
The increase in regional expenditure is in fact made at the expense of the common agricultural policy, and therefore at the expense of France.
We can see that the share allocated to the French regions is continually shrinking.
The vast majority of the EUR 347 billion in Structural Funds is to be given to Eastern Europe, destroyed by more than 40 years of communism.
Already in the year 2000, Brussels withdrew the Structural Funds granted under the former Objective I from the cantons of France's Hainaut region.
Today France, which contributes 16% of European budget revenue, is giving more and more but receiving less and less.
What is more, this regional aid has not protected those affected by the world economic crisis because it forms part of the ultra-liberal philosophy of the Lisbon Strategy.
Now more than ever, we need to build a new Europe that will at last provide economic protection for our regions and our nations through an active policy of reassuming control of our internal market.
<D>
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I wish first of all to say that we in the European Parliament delegation attended two summits: first the parliamentary pre-summit with our colleagues from the Pan-African Parliament, and also the official summit.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I think you cannot be aware of the status we had there, in other words the degrading status of observers: Members of the European Parliament, even if they had worked well on previous occasions, had no access to the official summit.
I very much wished to inform the House of this, and I feel that we, as Members of the European Parliament, represent European citizens in the same capacity as heads of state or government.
Thus it would be right if we were also represented at the next summit.
The official summit, however, was a splendid initiative, and it is good to know that it has been held after seven years of failed attempts.
I do feel, however, that the main lesson to be learned from the summit is that the African continent is finally becoming emancipated and organised as an African unit, and this is certainly good news.
This reminds me of the discussions we had at our parliamentary pre-summit with the Commissioner, where we stressed the contradiction between, on the one hand, the political display of the EU's vision and the new approach to its partners, and, on the other hand, the pressure exerted by the EU to get the economic partnership agreements signed.
I now wish to ask the Commissioner about the status of these partnerships, these interim agreements to be signed, because I must remind you that the African countries rejected this type of agreement and this kind of pressure.
Finally, Commissioner, another question on a matter of some concern: the nuclear issue.
The question from the Group of the Greens is as follows: why did nuclear talks commence with African countries?
African countries are now in need of renewable energy.
Our technology, our solar energy, photovoltaic systems and wind-energy systems are truly suited to Africa.
What, then, was the reason, particularly when we are aware of the difficulties this can entail, such as with Iran at the moment?
Why, Mr Vice-President?
This is a very important question.
I would also like to know which country forced the EU to add the nuclear issue to the strategy.
Was it my president, the worldwide nuclear sales representative?
This is totally unbelievable.
It is renewable forms of energy that Africa needs at the present time.
<D>
in writing. - (PT) Although many other considerations deserve a mention with regard to this report, we should like to point out, in this explanation of vote, that we cannot understand why our proposed amendment, aimed at including a mention of the outermost regions - such as the Azores and Madeira - within the definition of the priorities for transport logistics in the various EU countries, was rejected.
Our amendments, which were rejected, placed the accent on:
the strategic importance of public services and their contribution to the public sector in promoting economic, social and territorial cohesion, and criticism of the policies that challenge the role of the State as a provider of public services;
the incentive effect of public investments co-financed by the Structural Funds under the cohesion policy, which attract private investment and the possibility of using Community funding to finance private investment where there is no public investment strategy.
The rejection is all the more significant since the report notes that logistics is primarily a business activity, considering, however, that public authorities can play a role and act as facilitators and asking for the dissemination of best practice in financing logistics, for example, various initiatives using private-public co- financing.
A word to the wise...
<D>
Member of the Commission. - What I can say in general is that we have to address all these problems bearing in mind that what we have here is a competence of the Member States.
So we have to respect that.
I can understand your point that discrepancies persist but the Commission will nevertheless do everything it can to facilitate Member States in harmonising the situation between them.
Our priority is to facilitate cooperation among Member States to reduce the inequalities.
Another thing we can do is to pursue the issue as part of the Process on Corporate Responsibility in the field of Pharmaceuticals launched by the Commission.
On the question raised by Mr Chountis, what I can say is that when the directive is in place we will provide a clear legal framework regarding rights to reimbursement for cross-border health care.
We then propose to reduce the inequalities inherent in divergent implementation of European court decisions.
Citizens will then be sure about when and on what basis they will, or will not, be reimbursed for care received abroad.
Until then we have to wait, I'm afraid.
Subject: Enabling technologies
Given Europe's ongoing weakness in translating R&D into commercial products, can the Commission give an overview of where we currently stand in terms of strengthening Europe's position in key enabling technologies?
<D>
Mr President, I rise on the situation of the Roma minority and citizens from new Member States in Italy.
In recent days there have been police raids on Roma communities in Rome.
118 of those detained have been ordered to be expelled immediately and the new mayor has said that he will expel 20 000 people.
There have been arson attacks on Roma camps in the suburbs of Naples, with the mob preventing fire services getting in to extinguish the fires.
Hundreds of immigrant families have fled for their lives and there are reports of a number of children missing.
My colleague, Viktória Mohácsi, has been in Rome.
She has sent worrying reports and I hope she will have an opportunity to respond to the Council's statement tomorrow.
We know attacks in many of our Member States on immigrant communities are a problem, but the level of violence in Italy is unusual.
The OSCE has accused Italy of stigmatising migrants and it seems to me that the nature of the recent election campaign has led to a culture of impunity for those carrying out these attacks.
Even Commissioner Frattini, who was the first to lecture the new Member States on the integration of ethnic minorities, is now questioning the Schengen Agreements.
This issue is of Europe-wide concern.
It goes to the heart of the reasons for founding the European Union and I would urge the Commission and the Council urgently to discuss the matter to see what can be done to help.
<D>
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Madam President, President of the Council, President of the Commission, Mr Almunia, the European Verts Group - the group I have been asked to represent this afternoon - has approved the decisions of yesterday's Ecofin Council.
I think the only thing that should concern us, and which is of concern to you, is the reaction of the markets today, which do not seem entirely convinced that the proposals are correct.
I hope the markets are going to pull themselves together again and I hope the European authorities will continue to act in this sense.
I would like to share with you three comments, or three messages.
The first message concerns Europe itself.
Parliament is in fact divided, in part.
Many people have wanted to point out that Europe was absent from the management of the banking and financial crisis.
We, the European Verts, would like to point out that the banking crisis particularly reveals the inadequacy of common European rules and that, in this area as in many others, there is a need for more of Europe, not less of Europe.
The second message concerns the responsibility of those involved.
I have heard and I understand that Mr Barroso in particular believes that the time has come for action, certainly, but I also think the time has come to identify where some of the responsibility lies.
It would be all too easy for me to point the finger at the Council, the governments that make up the Council, or the Commission, since some Commissioners believed that better lawmaking meant self regulation, not lawmaking at all.
To take a concrete example, let us look at the directive on deposit guarantee schemes: in November 2006, the Commission submitted a report which said that no further legislation was needed in this field.
I am not sure you would uphold this position today.
However, it is actually Parliament I am addressing.
A week ago, in this Parliament, we voted for a report by Mr Rasmussen.
The first version was excellent and we supported it.
Parliament had to secure a majority vote by lowering the requirements expressed by the rapporteur himself.
We are experiencing the same thing today with the Lamfalussy report on the structure of supervision of the financial markets.
There again, everyone needs to take his own share of the blame.
I believe the PPE Group and the Liberal Group, Mr Watson, have a particular responsibility for the watering down of the report that we will be voting on tomorrow.
Next, I would just like to say a few words about the crisis.
This is a message to you, Mr Barroso, since you are the one setting up another reflection group (there are many, but a new one is perhaps welcome), notably on the link between the financial crisis and the environmental crisis.
The financial crisis, as you have said yourself, does not erase the environmental crisis.
From that point of view, I think what this banking crisis shows in the medium term is that there is a real problem with the allocation of savings in the European Union.
What I would like - what the European Greens would like you to put on the agenda of this group - is reflection on the instruments that the European Union might have at its disposal.
I am thinking in particular of the European Investment Bank, which should be charged with providing long-term finance so that the energy/climate package and the investment it represents are effectively guaranteed.
I think this is essential.
<D>
The building sector was identified by the EU as one of the markets with the highest energy saving potential.
Energy savings for energy efficient buildings average 30% over conventional buildings.
In the new EU Member States, including Lithuania, in many apartment blocks, around 60% of thermal energy is wasted.
In Lithuania alone, there are over 35 000 apartment blocks.
Their inhabitants not only pay huge sums for heating, but are also responsible for tonnes of CO2 emissions.
The Conservative government in Lithuania is incapable of beginning building insulation.
After almost two years of promises that renovation will start imminently, not one building has been renovated.
I voted for this recommendation on the energy performance of buildings, since it promotes the objective of moving towards nearly zero energy buildings.
This will guarantee that in time, EU buildings become sustainable from an energy point of view.
By implementing this directive, we will begin the process of reducing the EU's energy consumption by one fifth by the year 2020.
Investment to increase energy efficiency will create millions of jobs and will contribute to the growth of the EU economy.
<D>
(FR) Mr President, I agree, and so does my group, that the European Union's enlargement policy is one of its most productive and most convincing policies.
That is why, Mr Rehn, I am a little concerned for your future, because I am not entirely sure how you are going to be able to find a portfolio within the future Commission that is more attractive than that of enlargement.
It is absolutely astounding to see what the prospect of membership can bring about as a force for change, for democracy-building, in a country such as Turkey.
Yes, of course, there are still many things to achieve: the independence of the judiciary, a role for the army, freedom of expression, that all aspects of the Kurdish issue are genuinely dealt with once and for all, of course.
However, I feel it is important to emphasise that this EU enlargement strategy is not just for the benefit of the countries that are going through the accession process; it is for our benefit and for the benefit of our European decision makers, too.
It is irresponsible to diminish the efforts to change of a country such as Turkey by allowing doubts to remain about the outcome of the negotiation process.
Yes, the outcome of the negotiation process will be that Turkey joins, and we must say so clearly.
<D>
The European regulations governing working time, driving time and rest periods for transport operators refer not only to social conditions in the road transport sector, but especially to road safety as well.
Unfortunately, the European Union has not managed to do enough to reduce traffic accidents.
Member States admittedly need to improve the controls which they apply to transport in transit.
As rapporteur for social conditions, I have examined the first report compiled by the European Commission, which ought to have been produced twice yearly.
It was unfortunately delayed, but I noticed from that report that some Member States have exceeded in practice the minimum rate of checks they had to carry out, while other Member States have not fulfilled these obligations.
I am pleased that in Mr Grosch's report on market access we have managed, along with the Council of the European Union, to produce a compromise text, namely, we have requested for all traffic checks not to be discriminatory, based either on the nationality or country of residence of the transport operator.
Commissioner, we certainly need safe parking areas.
There was a draft report for the construction of safe parking areas at the border between the European Union and Russia but, unfortunately, these parking areas are not sufficient.
Member States must invest more in safe parking areas as, regrettably, 40% of robberies carried out on transport operators take place in parking areas.
We have also made an amendment to the budget so that we can allocate money for the construction of safe parking areas.
I believe that the conditions governing driving time and rest periods can only be met if we create conditions for transport operators which allow these provisions to be fulfilled.
<D>
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Malmström described the situation in Guinea perfectly.
For several weeks, Guinea has been the scene of violent clashes during which free citizens demonstrating in the streets in the name of their political beliefs have been subjected to unprecedented violence.
The Guinean Government is persecuting and killing anyone whose political beliefs differ from those of their leaders, thereby depriving the people of any kind of freedom which, as we well know, is obviously an inviolable right for every human being.
The umpteenth massacre is taking place and is in danger of turning into genocide if we do not urgently adopt immediate, tangible measures.
Last week, the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, of which I am Vice-Chairman, decided to adopt a resolution condemning the use of force by the Guinean authorities and demanding that the local government immediately complies with the rule of law and upholds fundamental rights.
Following the deaths of 157 people in street clashes, and the attempts of Moussa Dadis Camara to cover this up, members of the opposition turned to the international community in the hope of receiving help and greater protection.
On 5 October, however, Captain Camara opposed the presence of a foreign peacekeeping force in the country, rejecting any kind of foreign interference in internal affairs.
I therefore feel that in addition to expressing our condemnation, we need to respond by taking immediate, concrete action, as my fellow Member Mr Rinaldi just said.
In the face of violations and denials of the right to life - with women and children paying the price once again - we cannot fail to act and demand a return to the rule of law.
Therefore, by calling upon you, my fellow Members and representatives of the institutions, I hope that we can reach unanimous agreement - and I stress unanimous - to adopt immediate measures enabling the people of Guinea to re-establish fundamental and inalienable rights, such as democracy and freedom, in their country.
Naturally, I also wish to personally express my support for all the families affected by these tragic events.
<D>
Mr President, as someone who has visited Kenya previously and in particular the slum areas in Nairobi, I am familiar with the corruption that was in place even prior to this election.
I condemn the tragic loss of up to 600 lives, and the critical humanitarian situation which has ensued after the 27 December elections in Kenya.
I call on the relevant authorities and stakeholders to do their utmost to bring peace to Kenya and ensure that human rights and the rule of law are respected.
It is most unfortunate that Kenya, being one of the most stable and economically-developed nations in East Africa, has now descended into such chaos, as this will most likely have detrimental knock-on effects on its neighbouring countries.
The EU election observation mission concluded that the lack of transparency and adequate security procedures severely undermined the credibility of the presidential election results.
Today, Mr Odinga's opposition party has called once again for nationwide protests regarding the outcome of last month's presidential election.
These opposition rallies are due to last for three days, despite a government ban.
Such protests could lead to further bloodshed.
Many of the killings seem to have been based purely on ethnic differences, the most horrendous of which was the brutal attack on a church near the town of Eldoret, which is thought to have left more than 30 ethnic Kikuyu dead.
I urge Mr Kibaki to respect his country's democratic commitments as enshrined in Kenya's national Constitution and the guidelines of the African Charter of Human and People's Rights.
I call on the Presidency of the EU and the European Commission to monitor closely the mediation mission that will be led by Mr Annan later this week and, if required, to ensure an immediate continuation of these mediation efforts by a high-level EU delegation, possibly a joint EU-AU initiative.
<D>
Mr França, my reply has to be brief, but your question is very interesting.
In terms of the legal text - the letter of the Treaty - I have to say that the vast majority of the precepts of primary legislation that the Economic and Monetary Union needs in order to work as we all want it to work have been on the books since the Treaty of Maastricht and have been taken up by the subsequent Treaties.
Today, they are included in the Treaty of Nice; tomorrow they will be included in the Treaty of Lisbon.
There are some additional improvements in the Treaty of Lisbon, but the core of what Economic and Monetary Union needs in terms of the Treaty has been on the books since Maastricht.
However, the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, together with decisions designed to boost European integration, such as those adopted last week in the European Council and this morning by you here, create the necessary framework for economic and monetary integration to forge ahead in the direction in which it needs to go.
The very wording of the Treaty could determine how much progress is made with Economic and Monetary Union, and whether it heads in the right direction or in the wrong direction.
I believe that the Treaty of Lisbon as a political objective and the political will shown by the leaders, the Member States, Parliament and the Commission to press ahead with the Treaty of Lisbon, despite the difficulties of successive failed referendums, are what Economic and Monetary Union needs in terms of a political space, a political environment, in order to head in the right direction.
<D>
in writing. - (PL) One of the consequences of the free movement of persons in the European Union is the growth in cross-border car traffic.
It raises the need to establish provisions at European level in the field of motor insurance so as to protect accident victims effectively.
The efficiency of the claims representative system established by the insurance company in the victim's country of permanent residence is exceptionally important for the achievement of this aim.
It is the claims representative's duty to inform the victim how to pursue his claim against a foreign national, and it would increase consumer confidence if the information package accessible before conclusion of the insurance contract included full information on the rules governing the functioning and application of the claims representative system and its benefits for the victim.
Another important issue raised by the rapporteur is whether legal expenses insurance should be compulsory in all Member States.
I support his view that maintenance of the existing voluntary system is the right solution.
The increase in consumer confidence brought about by a compulsory system would be outweighed by the increase in the cost of the insurance itself and the delays resulting from settlement of cases by the courts.
It is nevertheless essential that measures be taken immediately with regard to the availability of legal protection insurance, especially in the new Member States.
<D>
Mr President, for some bizarre reason I broke the trend of a lifetime in this Parliament today by not voting against a report by the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality - I abstained.
In the past, I have constantly voted against these reports because they are normally full of complete rubbish.
But, as a married father with two girls, I try to read every word of these reports and guess what they actually mean.
I have some concerns about the committee this stuff comes from - I do not really think we need a Women's Committee in this place when we have a Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs.
There are some phrases in this report - the 'feminisation of poverty', for example - which mean absolutely nothing but sound great to the PC brigade that resides out there.
I do wonder what this committee would feel about, say, those who break the glass ceiling: for example, a mother of five, whose youngest child suffers from Down's syndrome, whose eldest daughter might be five months pregnant - as in the potential Vice-President of the United States, Sarah Palin?
I think that committee would not like the fact that she has broken through the glass ceiling.
But I abstained on this report.
<D>
in writing. - (LV) In the last few years, the euro has experienced several shocks, which would possibly have destroyed another currency.
The actions of EU leaders, albeit they have not always been sufficiently swift or convincing, have enabled the euro to be defended.
The situation is still fraught with difficulty, but I am convinced that Europe will overcome this crisis and become economically more powerful.
This crisis has revealed the EU's weak spots and more clearly shown what amendments are necessary to European Union legislation, including the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, with respect to the stability mechanism for euro area countries.
I am convinced that the establishment of the European financial stabilisation mechanism (EFSM) is one of the most important steps that can be taken for the EU to avoid serious economic crises in the future.
Of course, the establishment of the EFSM will not solve all problems, which is why it is important that governments recognise their responsibility for compliance with the Maastricht criteria, and implement a sensible, well-considered economic and monetary policy based on long-term objectives.
We cannot afford a repetition of the scenarios of recent years, when Member States pursued 'foot hard down on the accelerator' economic policies, disregarding the Maastricht criteria and breaking other fundamental laws of economics.
The euro is not only a currency; it is a political covenant, demonstrating the EU's ability to be united in diversity.
The euro is the guarantee of European stability, growth and unity.
That is why I do not have the slightest doubt that we shall be able to be sufficiently clear-sighted and wise to overcome this crisis and give a new stimulus to development.
<D>
in writing. - This report refers to the Lisbon treaty, which, let me remind you, is not in force.
It is therefore highly presumptuous, not to say arrogant, to be invoking the name of the Lisbon treaty as if it was already a fact of life.
In case you had forgotten: the Lisbon treaty was sunk by the democratic will of the people of Ireland.
They put the brakes on the project because they wanted a different kind of Europe.
In voting the way they did, the people of Ireland also spoke for the citizens of every other Member State, including my own, who were denied a referendum by their governments.
Ireland has been bullied into holding a second vote, but the Irish people are unlikely to take kindly to being treated with such contempt.
In future, we should avoid bringing ourselves into disrepute by discussing hypothetical scenarios such as the Lisbon treaty.
It merely serves to expose the EU's arrogant disregard for democratic opinion.
I voted against this report.
<D>
I welcome the vote on this report, for which I was appointed shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats).
For the sake of the 500 or so million citizens that we represent, we need to learn from this crisis so that we can deal with any new pandemic threats more effectively.
The text adopted yesterday is a very good compromise in terms of health cooperation, independence and transparency.
Given the proven failure of genuine health cooperation between Member States, it was necessary to adopt a constructive and practical approach involving the following actions:
Reinforced cooperation between Member States and better coordination between Member States and European institutions to ensure a more effective response in the event of a future pandemic;
Clarification of the roles of the structures at EU level for the management of medical threats;
The call on the WHO to revise the definition of the criteria for raising a global pandemic alert;
The assessment of the vaccination and communication strategies applied in Member States to regain citizens' trust;
The creation of a system of joint public procurement of vaccines by Member States, to prevent disparities;
The publication of the declarations of interest of the experts who advise the European public health authorities, to prevent any conflicts of interest.
<D>
To work for months on the sustainability of pension systems in Europe, to draw up an ambitious report, to negotiate compromises for hours without wishing to state the obvious, which is that many European Union governments have engaged in reforms of pension systems, giving priority to extending the contribution period, is, for me, an act of the utmost levity.
The denial of reality is an act of gross negligence.
The European Parliament is not tackling the core issue, because it is divisive!
I disapprove of this way of doing politics: instead of seeking unanimity at all costs, the European Parliament has fundamentally chosen the wrong method.
It has a duty to explore coherent and courageous courses of action.
That is what our citizens expect when pension systems, which are the real prizes of the European social model, are in danger.
I am therefore unable to support a report that has turned into a vain exercise, since it fails to take account of the reality of the situation.
<D>
I, too, am pleased that Mr Deva has taken a seat, for now Mrs Ferrero-Waldner will be able to hear me, which is a great relief.
This unprecedented economic crisis, which is biting hard, spells renewed disaster for developing countries.
The crisis leads to a drop in prices for raw materials, fewer investments, less trade credit and less money being sent home by immigrants.
Meanwhile, the gross domestic products of all the rich countries are dwindling fast, which means that the budget for development cooperation is also being decimated as this is 0.7% of GDP, or at least that is what it is supposed to be, and even then, most countries fail to live up to their promises.
This is the context of the discussion about the new policy instrument that is being held here.
If Spanish students receive a grant to study in Latin America for a few months, or vice versa, then such an exchange is useful, necessary and desirable, but a project such as this cannot be exclusively financed with funds that are intended to fight poverty.
Whilst EU funding in this area is to be welcomed, it is not fighting poverty.
It is frustrating to have to withdraw projects like this simply because there is no legal basis on which to back them.
That is why we have been looking for a modest instrument with which the EU can implement policy in developing countries that does not, strictly speaking, fall within the scope of fighting poverty.
A financial source and a legal basis that do not come under development policy will need to be found.
The legal basis cannot, therefore, lie in Article 179 of the Treaty of Nice, because that is precisely the statutory basis for development policy that should be avoided here.
The EU's own interests - European students making study trips - may not be financed under Article 179.
Moreover, the EU, when spending development funds, has to meet the criteria legally prescribed in respect of development cooperation, namely those of fighting poverty.
With a little bit of creativity, there are other sources.
Extending the Industrialised Countries Instrument is an option which the Committee on Foreign Affairs has put forward and which is also backed by my own committee.
What is also an option, though, is a combination of Articles 150, 151 and 170, education, culture and research.
With this combined legal basis, the European Parliament would maintain complete codecision with regard to this instrument, and the money, about EUR 13 million at the moment, is not taken out of the development policy kitty.
Neither is it taken out of the foreign policy kitty.
As rapporteur - and the Committee on Development will back me up on this - I cannot agree to Article 179 as the legal basis.
If it was, this new instrument would become ineffective, seeing as its exact aim is to prevent development funds from being used for other purposes.
There should not, therefore, be a legal basis for this instrument that could make this compulsory.
For this reason, I plead with the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats to withdraw its amendment as a matter of extreme urgency.
It flies in the face of our shared desire to protect the budget for development cooperation, even in times of economic crisis.
<D>
rapporteur. - (HU) Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, there is not much left for me to do other than to thank my fellow Members in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the other Committees for their close cooperation.
I also thank everyone who worked alongside the Committee and provided me with assistance in this highly complicated and difficult matter.
I am very pleased that we have managed to reach an agreement with the Council on this issue and hope that we can conclude the process at the first reading.
I would also like to express the hope that this process will continue at the same rhythm and tempo in the case of the second and fourth omnibus proposals - the fourth is possibly somewhat tougher and trickier.
Negotiations on these have already begun, and I have every confidence that there is a good chance of concluding this process by the end of the year or even sooner, and that the official process can get under way.
The Lisbon Treaty will introduce this system in the context of secondary legislation, but it would not have been right to waste two years without the comitology procedure.
I am convinced that Parliament needs this learning process; it needs to learn how to handle these matters.
One speaker mentioned that it is crucial that we ourselves should be able to distinguish between important and non-important matters; the role of the legislature is really to concentrate on vital matters and for this reason it needs to delegate certain powers to the executive, in other words to the Commission, but we must retain the possibility and the right to scrutinise implementing measures drawn up by it.
The comments made have been incorporated into the proposals.
Thank you very much for your attention, and I wish every success to Parliament, the Commission and the Council in carrying out the tasks that are still to be done, given that this piece of legislation is number sixty-something and the bulk of the acts are still to be dealt with, and I hope that the matter can be resolved in the second half of the year.
Thank you very much for your attention.
Thank you for listening.
<D>
(RO) I would like, first of all, as other fellow Members have also done, to emphasise that the EU-Canada Summit is an important opportunity for deepening our partnership with this important democracy.
This relationship is extremely important to the EU as it involves partners who share the same values and have worked together over a long period of time.
At the same time, I would like to remind you of the declaration made at the previous EU-Canada Summit in Prague in May 2009, which reiterated the partners' common objective, and I quote, 'to enhance the free and secure movement of people between the EU and Canada, with a view to extending as soon as possible visa-free travel to Canada for all EU citizens'.
One year on, we are obliged to note that we are far from achieving this objective.
Currently, not only are Romanians and Bulgarians still subject to a compulsory visa requirement, but, as you are aware, visas were reintroduced for the Czech Republic last year.
I think that we have here, first and foremost, a problem of reciprocity.
Given, as you are well aware, that all EU Member States have waived visas for Canadian citizens, in accordance with our legislation, we have, on the other hand, if I may say so, a problem of consistency as Canada has removed the visa requirement for one of the candidate countries, Croatia, while, I repeat, currently retaining visa requirements for citizens from EU Member States.
I believe therefore that the May summit must make significant, if not decisive progress on the issue of waiving visas for all EU Member State citizens.
I think that specific measures are required and this objective must be placed as high as possible on the agenda because we are no longer happy with declarations of principle.
This form of discrimination is extremely unfair, especially for citizens in the country where I come from, a Member State of the European Union, which has made significant technical progress in terms of waiving visas.
<D>
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to highlight the very positive attitude and valuable work of the Court of Auditors and in particular to draw attention to the figures which we have received as regards the 2006 annual report.
There is an improvement in the use of Community funds.
This year, the Court has positively assessed the way in which 40% of funds have been spent, in comparison with 30% last year.
The positive development of which we can be sure, even though funds are far from being fully used, is that progress is being made every year.
Years ago the Court gave the green light to only 6% of total expenditure.
It is therefore interesting to note that most of the problems encountered are largely to do with irregularities rather than fraud.
The most frequent types of errors are missing documents, failure to respect eligibility criteria, inaccurate declarations and failure to comply with procedures.
Complying with the formalities is obviously a problem.
The new Financial Regulation is a step forward towards simpler and more transparent governance.
Mandatory disclosure in respect of funds administered directly by national and regional authorities, which account for some 80% of the Community budget, is of particular importance.
Much remains to be done to streamline the formalities with a view to simplifying the provisions governing the release of funds.
That would make it possible substantially to reduce irregularities, especially on the part of small beneficiaries, many of whom lack the facilities required to carry out the necessary procedures.
Lastly, a key point of the European financial control system continues to be the issue of recoveries.
If recovery work is to be made easier, more detailed information and data need to be made available to the Court of Auditors, Parliament and the Commission and more binding legislative instruments, such as guarantee and performance bond systems, need to be introduced.
Although the results set out in the annual report of the Court of Auditors show some improvement, I would conclude by saying that simplifying procedures and improving cooperation by states during the control stage continue to be major challenges.
<D>
The car manufacturing industry is one of the driving forces of the European economy.
Approximately 300 000 cars and 300 000 goods and passenger vehicles are produced in Europe every year.
Road transport is responsible for 72% of all emissions generated by transport, but the time has now come for us to reaffirm the importance of the car manufacturing industry from an economic and social perspective.
The financial crises and economic recession are having a severe impact on the car industry, which guarantees, both directly and indirectly, more than 15 million jobs.
2012 will be a crucial year for Europe's car manufacturing industry as new requirements will be introduced with regard to fuel quality, pollutant emission restrictions, type certification and the safety of road users.
In order to make our road traffic greener, the Union intends to introduce bonuses for greener vehicles and penalise those which cause more pollution.
The 'Climate Change' package will therefore become one of the means aimed at boosting demand for greener, safer vehicles.
Social Europe is based on economic development and, in an equal measure, on social values.
The European car industry must be supported to respond to the new challenges so that existing jobs can be preserved and it can remain competitive.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission welcomes the opportunity, a few days after International Women's Day on 8 March, to make a declaration before the European Parliament on childcare facilities for pre-school age children.
These facilities are essential for promoting gender equality and for helping to achieve a work-life balance, but also for ensuring quality of life for children.
At a meeting of the European Council in Barcelona in 2002, the Member States adopted ambitious aims which were to be fulfilled by 2010.
In line with the undertaking which the Commission accepted before the European Parliament in 2007, a report on the implementation of the Barcelona objectives was presented in October 2008.
In the report, the Commission spoke about why it is important to invest more in childcare facilities.
The Commission noted mainly that the Barcelona objectives are aimed at eliminating obstacles to accessing the labour market, especially for women.
More than 6 million women in the EU (aged from 25 to 49) say that they are unable to work or can work only part-time because of family obligations.
The European economy is thereby deprived of significant productive potential, and this at a time when it must confront serious economic and demographic challenges, and when the social position of families is thereby weakened.
The development of childcare facilities for pre-school age children will enable families to decide freely how to organise their time and how to achieve a better work-life balance.
The aim is not to 'force' parents to send their children to these facilities.
The aim is to offer this option to parents who want it.
The development of childcare services will also contribute to the prevention of poverty, especially for single-parent families, more than a third of whom face the threat of poverty.
In connection with the demographic slowdown which Europe is going through, access to childcare facilities will also assist in the implementation of family planning.
It turns out that the Member States with the highest birth rates are precisely those which have introduced the most highly-developed policies on the work-life balance and which record the highest levels of employment of women.
Childcare facilities also contribute to children's development, of course.
Numerous studies, especially those carried out by the OECD and UNICEF, have shown that these services play a significant role in the personal development of children, provided that they are of a high quality and children are entrusted to them for adequate periods of time.
Childcare services can also have a positive influence on educational results and future professional life.
The Commission states in its report that despite all of the aforementioned good reasons, most Member States are far from achieving the objectives set out in 2002.
A lot of work remains to be done, especially concerning children under three years old.
Furthermore, there are some facilities operating only for part of the working day, which restricts parents' access to the labour market.
The Commission recognises, however, that significant progress has been achieved in many Member States.
The undertakings adopted by Member States at a European level and the appeals expressed by the European Parliament in a series of resolutions have played an important role in this regard.
It is therefore necessary for all of the participants, especially the national and regional bodies, to come together and create progressive, financially accessible and high-quality childcare facilities for pre-school age children.
In the Plan for Achieving Gender Equality, the European Commission undertook to support the efforts being made by Member States in this area.
It encourages the Member States to make full use of the possibilities offered by the structural funds.
With the aim of assisting local organisations to introduce measures in this area, the Commission has adopted an information brochure in addition to last year's one on the possibilities for financing family support measures.
The Commission will continue to support the exchange of proven approaches and will regularly monitor the Barcelona objectives within the framework of the strategy for growth and employment.
It will also evaluate family policies, especially policies on the work-life balance, in which it will rely mainly on cooperation with the OECD.
Last but not least, the Commission will support adherence to European childcare objectives within the framework of the strategy for growth and employment after 2010.
Some people may be questioning the wisdom of investing in childcare facilities at a time of crisis.
Nevertheless, numerous studies have shown that where such services are not available, everyone pays the price.
It is therefore important to act today in order to ensure access to childcare facilities and in order to support employment and to promote equality, social inclusion and the interests of children.

In certain EU countries, there is justified concern on the part of the trade union movement about phoney selfemployment in connection with the Working Time Directive and selfemployed drivers.
Outsourcing and, as a consequence, employers evading their responsibilities, are growing problems.
The way to solve the problem that has been suggested, that is, that selfemployed drivers should be included in the directive, however, is wrong.
The right way to resolve the problems associated with phoney selfemployment would be to agree on a definition for selfemployment between worker and employer organisations at EU level.
At present, the innocent have to suffer.
With regard to this issue, we should proceed in accordance with the compromise which, among others, Mrs Wortmann-Kool, ViceChair of the centreright European People's Party (Christian Democrats), was building.
Under this, freelance drivers remain outside the scope of the directive, but Member States may, if they wish, apply the regulation of full-time working hours to freelance drivers in their own country.
The suggestion would probably mean that Parliament and the Council would reach agreement on the directive at first reading.
It is a pity that Parliament is not allowing any opportunities for a compromise.
While we should be focusing more on improving the status of entrepreneurs, instead there is the possibility that the working hours of genuine entrepreneurs will be restricted.
This is worrying, because the opportunities for small entrepreneurs to earn a living generally depend solely on the work they put in.
<D>
I am one of the people who prepared this resolution and therefore I voted for the goals planned in it.
Following the presidential elections, Ukraine must move closer to the European Union.
I am delighted that Ukraine is resolutely taking the path to democracy and that it understands it has a rightful place in the community of European democratic countries.
The door to Europe should be open for Ukraine.
Transparent elections are an important step in strengthening the principles of the democratic state.
Although observers announced that the Ukrainian presidential elections complied with high quality requirements and democratic principles, Ukraine's government institutions should nevertheless adopt clear election rules.
Freedom of expression and media pluralism in Ukraine must be ensured for all citizens and election candidates.
It is very important for Ukraine to participate in the Eastern Partnership and in the Euronest Parliamentary Assembly, cooperating with the European Parliament.
Ukraine today is a European country, which has the right to take decisions on Europe.
The European Union must cooperate intensively with Ukraine to strengthen the democratic process and integrate into the European Union.
<D>
(PL) Mr President, it is hard to be optimistic regarding the 2008 budget, because it is the lowest for many years in relation to the gross national income of the Member States, in terms of both commitment appropriations and payment appropriations.
I should like to remind the House that in the financial perspective 2007-2013 the ceiling for commitment appropriations for 2008 was set at 1.08% of gross national income.
It was set at 1.06% of gross national income for payment appropriations.
There is therefore a significant difference between what the European Union was prepared to finance only two years ago, and what it is now prepared to finance.
We cannot have more Europe for such limited funding in any of the areas to which the European Union allocates financial resources.
I welcome the fact that the conciliation procedure resulted in an agreement on financing the Galileo programme and the European Institute of Technology.
I hope, too, that the European Parliament will agree that budgetary reserves may be drawn on to finance the Frontex Agency.
This is particularly significant for countries such as Poland.
As early as December the borders of these countries will become the external borders of the European Union in the full sense of the term.
<D>
in writing. - The vote in favour of Mr Fazakas is disappointing.
It sets a serious precedent.
I voted together with the EPP against Mr Fazakas' confirmation as a Member of the Court of Auditors.
This was no ordinary vote.
Mr Fazakas is suspected of being an ex-collaborator of the Communist secret services.
The Hungarian press produced a document regarding this.
A number of opinions were heard that opposed any 'punishment' against Mr Fazakas.
They asked for the past not to be revived.
This is wrong.
The past is not dead.
Tens of millions of eastern Europeans still live a life troubled by the Communist horrors.
If the past is dead, then there is no sense in leading a life guided by norms and values.
This would be a recipe for the politics of diminished responsibility.
Public office would lose dignity.
Anyone, however corrupt or immoral, could stand for public office.
If there still are politicians unaware of the Communist record in eastern Europe, this does not qualify them for an informed opinion.
The perpetrators of the Communist indignity should not be part of a democratic order they tried to suppress.
Mr Fazakas hid his past and lied when asked about it.
This lack of honesty should not be rewarded.
<D>
(RO) The implementation of an integrated strategy on the development of sustainable transport must be an absolute priority, both for the Commission and for the Member States.
Investments in transport infrastructure must be accelerated, especially environmentally-friendly ones, such as: railways, inland waterway transport and Sea Motorways.
A comprehensive assessment of internal costs and in particular the negative impact of transport on the environment is compulsory.
Such negative impacts must be ascertained and assumed by their inclusion in the prices paid by users.
Consequently, it is highly important that the internalisation of external costs be carried out for all transport means at the same time.
Thus, the break-down by form of transport used would improve, favouring less polluting transport means, as well as the development of the trans-European network and intermodal freight transport.
I believe that better logistics and the improvement of management, especially via the intensification of research and application of new technologies in the field of intelligent systems, represent steps forward in better traffic planning, management of flows and elimination of traffic agglomeration and jams.
Romania is making concerted efforts coming into line with European standards, especially by attracting investments in disadvantaged areas to lay the foundation for a reduction in the development discrepancies in infrastructures.
At the same time, Romania supports and promotes actions aimed at making energy consumption more effective in order to take part in the reduction of the negative environmental impact of transport and supports investments in alternative energy sources.
I hereby ask the European Commission to reassess the multiannual financial frameworks for financial resources in the field of transport, as well as for the field-related research with a view to obtaining cost effective and energy-enhanced products and services.
At the same time, I recommend that the Member States support public - private partnerships and, by way of consequence, private investments in the said field and that they make full use the funds made available to create a sustainable transport sector, to improve traffic safety and the health of the environment in which we live.
<D>
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Martin Luther King had a dream.
He dreamt of a society where the colour of your skin did not lead to discrimination.
It was a dream that revolutionised America and the world.
Today Europe has a dream, or rather a vision: to develop the energies of the future, not only in Europe but also beyond Europe, the vision of renewable energies playing a major role by the middle of this century, helping to avoid conflicts over the remaining oil and gas resources, mitigating climate change and ensuring that billions of people across the world have access to the energy that is out of their reach today.
I think that the Commission, represented today by its environmental conscience, Mr Dimas, has every reason to be proud of this Global Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Fund (GEEREF).
It is our assumption that within four or five years there will be EUR 500 million in this Fund, making it the world's largest fund for investment in renewables and energy efficiency.
These EUR 500 million will come in part from the public purse, with around EUR 80 to 150 million from the European budget, but also from the national governments' budgets.
We have specific commitments currently from Germany and also from Norway.
What will this Fund achieve?
The financial analysts who look in detail at flows of investment into individual renewable energy and energy efficiency projects have observed that it is difficult to attract risk capital for investments of less than EUR 10 million.
This Fund will be geared particularly to these medium-sized projects up to EUR 10 million.
It will therefore be a 'fund of funds', which means that this Fund will not invest directly in wind farms in Morocco or solar energy systems in China, but will acquire shares in investment funds in Southern Africa, in Central Africa, in China, in Russia or in South America.
The public purse will determine politically where the funding will go.
It will be attractive for private investors because the public purse will in effect cover all the investment risk, so that the returns on the investments - if these investments yield any returns, that is - will go first to private investors and only in the second phase will they go back into the public purse, and that of course provides a great deal of security for private investors.
We as parliamentarians have raised four or five points relating to this Fund.
The first is also a specific question to Commissioner Dimas.
At a time when biofuels are an extremely controversial issue, we as parliamentarians have taken the view that we must apply very strict criteria for any biomass or biofuel project investment from the Fund.
It is not just that the environmental balance could be problematical; it would also pose an image problem for the Fund if its reputation were to be damaged by such investment.
Once again, then, Commissioner, can you guarantee that the Commission will do its best to apply the strict criteria that are required?
The second issue of importance to us as parliamentarians - and I think this is especially true of those of us who are concerned with development - is that we want this Fund to make a significant contribution to overcoming energy poverty.
We therefore need to apply the know-how of microfinancing institutions such as the Grameen Bank and others that are already implementing projects for the poorest of the poor, such as solar collectors or PV systems.
We must involve these microfinancing institutions.
My second question to you, Commissioner, is this: is the Commission willing, as the major public donor, to ensure that 20-25% of the funding will genuinely be utilised for this type of microproject through microfinancing arrangements?
Thirdly, we were afraid that if investing in China is becoming so easy, all the funding from GEEREF would flow in that direction.
What we want, however, is a good geographical spread of investment and so we need the Commission's political commitment that funds will be provided for investment in countries in Africa, the Caribbean and South America as well.
As Parliament, we need stringent monitoring and evaluation with regular reports to this House and its Committee on Budgets and Committee on Budgetary Control, because we want to increase this Fund if possible over the next few years: to do that, we of course need the confidence of this House in the workings of the Fund.
Those are my initial comments, and I look forward to the debate with my fellow Members.
(Applause)
<D>
in writing. - The summit between European and African countries took place on the 8 and 9 December in Lisbon, Portugal.
More than 70 heads of state and government attended.
Malta's contribution focused on the issue of irregular immigration.
It is in Malta's interest that Africa is seen as Europe's responsibility.
Assistance given and investment made in Africa will mean that fewer people from that continent will be forced to leave their country for a better life.
The majority of irregular immigrants that reach Malta come from sub-Saharan Africa and are economic immigrants.
The situation, however, could deteriorate when the general preferential trade agreements expire on the 31 December 2007.
Most African countries have rejected the proposal of 'special partnership agreements'.
Only one fifth have signed interim agreements.
Even if the expiry date is extended, it is in the interest of every country to sign interim agreements to absorb the negative economic impact following the expiry of the 'preferential agreements'.
Other irregular immigrants who come to Malta are political refugees.
The fact that human rights issues in Darfur and Zimbabwe were omitted from the original agenda does not augur well for the voiceless who continue to suffer in silence.
<D>
(DA) Mr President, one of the most elementary tasks of a parliament is to scrutinise the finances.
This naturally requires parliament to have the opportunity to inspect the different budget items.
It is therefore totally unacceptable for the Council to continue in its closed position towards Parliament.
We have today heard how the French Presidency has failed to respond to any of the approaches made by Parliament's rapporteurs responsible for the 2009 budget and, as rapporteur for the Committee on Budgetary Control on the granting of discharge to the Council for 2007, I can add that the Council has been equally unwilling to respond to my approaches.
Thus, the Council is not only closed with regard to the future, but also with regard to the past.
This is not just a problem with the French Presidency; it is a problem with the Council in general.
Their argument is to refer to a so-called 'gentlemen's agreement' between the Council and Parliament dating back to 1970.
Excuse me? 1970?
That was when the EU was called the EC.
At that time, the EC consisted of a handful of countries and Parliament was not elected, but appointed.
This 'gentlemen's agreement' therefore belongs to the past and has no value today.
As Parliament, we must demand openness, full access to information and cooperation from the Council.
<D>
(SK) There are several areas in the action plan of the Stockholm Programme I would like to talk about, and as we have to move on, I will name these problem areas.
I definitely consider the EU's common asylum system to be a problem area, which we have discussed together at least several times here, where, on the one hand, the Commission talks of the need for legal migrants or immigrants to be successfully integrated into the common system but, on the other, the action plan displays very little ambition in this direction.
Likewise, it appears that we do not expect a proposal for the unified processing of asylum applications until 2014, and therefore no mutual recognition of the rights of refugees between EU Member States either.
Your plans are nonetheless quite concrete in the area of restricting the influx and movement of immigrants or migrants, for example, seasonal workers.
So, to be brief, there is no progressive and fair common asylum system in sight, and the plan specifies rather repressive measures.
I would like to mention at least two more areas.
The first is the sad fact that, even in the Commission's own words, progress over the mutual recognition of registered same-sex partnerships within an EU framework is not a priority, and the sidetracking of this topic really concerns me.
The final area I would like to mention is the rights of corporations.
The Stockholm Action Plan often mentions citizens and their rights, but very clearly emphasises the freedom of business without sufficient regulations, which is at least surprising, particularly in the context of the current financial and economic crisis.
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (HU) Thank you, Madam President.
I will speak in Hungarian.
Commissioner, last week, representing the Committee on Culture and Education, I took part in a conference in Lisbon entitled 'Young Voices - Meeting Diversity in Education', organised by the Portuguese Presidency.
It was a profoundly moving experience to hear young people living with a variety of physical and learning disabilities present their school experiences.
There was one common feature in their story: every one of them said that they felt that if they were able to participate in school activities alongside their able-bodied peers, they would not be judged according to their disabilities but according to their abilities and personalities.
Integrating children living with a disability into mainstream education alongside their able-bodied peers is also vital in order to ensure that society accepts them and includes them more easily as adults.
If children are accustomed from an early age to being around children who have some disability or other, and are accustomed to having to respect them equally and perhaps to helping them, then there is a good chance that they will demonstrate more understanding and more empathy towards disadvantaged people in their adult lives.
The report we have before us speaks a great deal about integration issues relating to social differences.
I am convinced that, by analogy to the example I referred to above, it is also important for children who are socially disadvantaged to be able to participate in an inclusive way alongside other children in all the various stages of education.
To achieve this, two things have to be put in place.
One is technological progress and removal of barriers.
From this point of view, central and eastern European Member States are lagging far behind: schools, the school environment, transport facilities, even the hospitals, other institutions, public institutions, for example, are all inaccessible to wheelchair users.
The other, and this will take longer, is the change in attitude that is needed on the part of decision-makers in order for them to acknowledge that inclusive education is the first crucial stage in the process that leads to social acceptance and integration.
In conclusion, let me say that sports, too, are an important tool for education and social leverage, because social and societal differences disappear in sports; the only things that matter are talent, determination and application.
Physical education in schools and sports contribute greatly to strengthening important social values such as solidarity and respect for each other's dignity.
This is why I consider it important that when this House debates the quality, efficiency and equity of education and training, reference should also be made to the importance of physical education and its quality, efficiency and equity.
We also need to ensure that inclusive education in this regard plays a major part.
I congratulate the rapporteur and thank you for your attention.
<D>
(ES) Madam President, Commissioner, on 23 January I was in Galicia when winds of almost 200 km per hour struck my region: over 40 000 hectares of forest were devastated, Commissioner.
Galicia has the highest density of forested land in the European Union.
After the passage of the storm, hundreds of thousands of trees had been blown down, roads were blocked and more than 500 km of high- and low-tension electricity cables were down and have still not been fully repaired.
Over 300 000 subscribers, including myself, suffered power cuts, in some cases for several days, as well as a loss of telephone services.
The storm caused injuries and badly damaged homes, infrastructure, farms, businesses, industrial plant, sports facilities as well as public and municipal buildings.
The response of the Government of Galicia to the storm, the worst in recorded history, allowed aid of EUR 17 million to be quickly approved for initial compensation of those affected and to subsidise repair of the damage.
As we know and as has been mentioned here, on 26 January the two worst affected Member States, France and Spain, requested European aid for the damage caused by the storm.
As the damage that we have suffered can be defined as an extraordinary disaster under the terms of the prevailing Solidarity Fund Regulation, the governments of the two Member States announced that they had commenced work to apply for assistance from the Fund.
However, once again, as in the recent floods in Romania, we find that the requirements of the regulation are so restrictive that in actual fact they prevent this disaster being considered severe, Commissioner.
I would like to recall, as you and other Members have already done, that the Commission presented its proposal in 2005 and that Parliament issued its opinion in favour of reform of the Fund Regulation in 2006.
Since then, the matter has been blocked in the Council, which has sat on the proposed reform for over two years.
For all these reasons, Commissioner, and given that these circumstances are exceptional and that the disaster has had serious repercussions for the living conditions and economic stability of the affected regions, I would ask you to trigger the Fund as proof of solidarity with the Member States concerned and above all with the citizens affected.
They should be given financial assistance, as I believe, even though the sum involved is not so great, this would be a direct and urgently needed expression of European solidarity.
<D>
President of the Commission. - I want to win this competitiveness battle globally.
One thing is sure: we need more people, working more and longer - and I would add, better, in a more competitive way.
There is no contradiction between having longer working lives and having some immigration to Europe.
In fact, it is quite extraordinary, but today, there are almost one million job vacancies in Germany and almost half a million in the UK.
This shows that there is a problem of mismatch between the supply and demand for labour.
There is a lot to do in this area.
I believe that pension reforms are also a way of contributing to that.
I want to underline that, during this crisis, Member States did not resort to the traditional policy of having people leave the workforce earlier.
They have not done so.
In fact, it has been possible to keep people in work for longer.
This is important because, for Europe to remain competitive, we need to raise the employment rate in Europe.
<D>
Mr President, we talk a great deal here about protecting children.
Evidence abounds to suggest that artificial flavourings and supplements are detrimental to the health of children on many counts.
Firstly, we can consider the 435% increase we have seen in the rates of children with autism in the last 15 years and the rates of ADHD, which currently affects 3-5% of children.
Then we can consider the symptoms attributed to flavourings, of which there are so many, but let us take as an example MSG, which is found in children's sweets, drinks, snacks and dinners.
There are 92 symptoms, but among them are hyperactivity and mood irregularities.
As a mother myself, my primary concern in food is safety and transparency.
I feel that we are seriously compromising children and their ability to learn when we allow cocktails of colourings, preservatives and additives into their food.
Children need good fresh food, grown as locally and naturally as possible.
Therefore, let us really begin to protect children.
<D>
Mr Barroso, the President of the European Commission, is responsible for the current situation of financial, economic, food and environmental crisis in which Europe is immersed.
To date, no one has recognised his error, and the blame has instead been placed on the United States.
To date, the Commission has tried to build a Europe based on policies of privatisation and dismantling of the social state.
The Commission adopted the Lisbon Strategy, which predicted economic growth of 3% and the creation of 20 million jobs by 2010.
The failure of this strategy is clear.
Despite that, the Commission is proposing to renew this strategy and continue with these policies, which are the cause of the crisis.
This crisis is not a pandemic; it is the result of a gamble on one specific policy: the policy adopted by the European Commission.
Its foreign policy programme makes no reference to the Sahara or Palestine.
These issues are not only not its priorities, but the EU is planning to grant advanced status to the Kingdom of Morocco and to upgrade relations with the State of Israel.
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, let us first of all look at the background to this.
The eight-hour mandatory time limit for animals in transport was agreed in December 2004 and entered into force in January 2007 across all 27 Member States, with special derogations applying to longer journeys where it could be demonstrated that vehicle standards had been upgraded, providing animals with access to water, temperature control, adequate ventilation, and where frequent rest periods were incorporated into the journey time.
Special derogations were also permitted for remote rural areas and islands, like Orkney and Shetland in my own constituency, for instance, where longer journey times are unavoidable.
In these cases, however, special bedded units with access to water have been designed so that the animals can be transported in relative comfort.
In addition, a complete transport ban was introduced on certain animals such as calves under 10 days old and lambs less than one week old.
I report with some satisfaction that these transport rules have been strictly observed, particularly in countries like Scotland, where we continue to maintain some of the highest levels of best practice in the whole of the EU.
But I am concerned at reports that, as Neil Parish has told us, these rules are not being similarly observed in other parts of the EU, particularly in some of the southern Mediterranean Member States and in some of the new East European accession states and particularly, again as Neil Parish stressed, where the transport of horses for slaughter is concerned.
Animal welfare NGOs are still producing evidence of horrific abuse, with horses and sometimes other livestock being transported over vast distances in searing heat, with no access to water or proper ventilation, with no rest periods, packed into overcrowded trucks.
As their journeys progress, these animals become increasingly exhausted and dehydrated, some succumb to heat stress and can be seen desperately panting and gasping for air and, in the worst cases, many die.
This practice has to be stopped and strict adherence to the regulation must be observed in all Member States.
I support the terms of Neil Parish's oral question today, which seeks to check on the level of compliance with these measures.
I hope that the Commission can now provide us with this information and reassure us that steps are being taken to ensure the rigorous implementation of the eight-hour transportation limit for animals, with the appropriate derogations that I mentioned, and to stop the cruel breach of the existing EU regulations that still goes on.
<D>
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would also like to thank our rapporteur, Mrs Grässle, for her important work within the framework of these reports, which enhance the plans for a financial regulation for executive agencies.
At a time when the European Parliament is set to see its prerogatives strongly reinforced within the framework of the Treaty of Lisbon, I think it is particularly important to remember what our institution's competences are, obviously as co-decider of the budget.
This Parliament, elected by direct universal suffrage by the citizens of the EU, must be able to do more and better to control the proper use of Community funds spent, this time by the executive agencies.
I would like very briefly to highlight four points in this report, which seem essential to me if Parliament is to be able to play its role fully and make it as easy as possible for citizens to understand our institutions.
Firstly, I would also like to emphasise the need for better control over the use of assigned revenue.
It seems important for the director of the agency to tell us about any transfers between titles exceeding the 10% threshold.
Secondly I should also highlight the importance of the figures for the establishment plan, as our fellow Member has just mentioned, whether for temporary staff, contract workers, seconded national experts, etc., so that we as the budgetary authority have a clear picture of the development of the human resources budgets of the agencies.
Thirdly, I think it is quite natural that we should be asking for a summary of the development of the agencies' budgets to be sent to the European Parliament each year, in accordance with the recommendations of the European Court of Auditors.
Fourthly and finally, the provisions in the report concerning the harmonisation of the deadlines for the discharge procedure should also give Parliament real control of the proper execution of the budget.
<D>
(EL) Mr President, the Dublin II system for granting asylum should, at long last, be revised.
Firstly, it is not truly European: it does not guarantee genuine solidarity and support for those Member States that receive a disproportionate number of asylum seekers owing to their geographical location.
The second and more important reason why it should be revised is that such disproportionate numbers often directly threaten the humanitarian principles and the obligation to treat people arriving at our borders in search of protection with dignity.
We know that occasionally many Member States are either perfectly reasonably unable to fulfil their obligations according to the regulation or, in the worst case, they hide behind a lack of European solidarity to justify even extreme violations of human rights committed by their authorities.
Practices such as detaining minors in unacceptable conditions and the wholesale rejection of asylum applications on political grounds are not justified by any lack of solidarity.
We also know, however, that other Member States that do not face such problems consider their humanitarian obligation fulfilled if they accuse other states.
We hear nothing about solidarity, however.
Thus Dublin II has in practice led to a series of accusations and counter-accusations between Member States.
The only real losers are the asylum seekers.
It is therefore of crucial importance to establish a genuine common European asylum system.
<D>
(DE) Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, Schengen is, and always has been, synonymous with the link between security on the one hand and freedom and liberality on the other.
For the citizens of Europe and for all of us, this has been part of the added value offered by the European Union.
It has always worked very well and has been applied effectively in the interim on a 'one for all' basis.
What is happening now is annoying.
However, it is also annoying that Parliament, which has always been very cooperative, has not been given the necessary information.
We have always kept the citizens of Europe informed.
The Schengen Information System II will be functioning perfectly and on schedule and now we find out that problems have arisen and that there does not seem to be an end in sight to the dilemma.
I would be interested to know whether the figures circulating in the media, which indicate that around EUR 100 million has so far been spent on developing the Schengen Information System II, are correct.
Will the company suffer the consequences?
Why has the Commission, the Council or another body not introduced a system of checks in good time?
<D>
- (PL) The House is about to debate the very dramatic and tragic situation in Congo, where the victims are counted in hundreds, or even in thousands.
In comparison, the situation in Venezuela appears far less serious.
It concerns violations of electoral rights and expulsions from the country.
The first murder has taken place, though.
A student leader has been killed.
Even at this stage, however, it is very important to raise the issue, because we must bear in mind that every such process begins with the violation of democratic rights.
The first stage is always abuse of power for want of arguments, and this subsequently leads to murder.
The resolution makes sense, therefore.
It serves as a signal, or as a reminder that this dangerous process has been noted when we still have the chance to monitor it and prevent genocide.
<D>
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, some things that you have worked hard on never happen, and some things happen only very late.
That was the case with this directive.
You would not expect any more for it to happen.
In 2002, six years ago, I was working very hard as your rapporteur in first reading on this Commission proposal after the social dialogue negotiations of the social partners' fields.
We managed to convince the Commission and the vast majority of the Council to adopt 95% of our amendments and improvements of the text, only a blocking minority of, at the time, 4 of the 15 Member States did not want to go along with that majority.
Several presidencies tried very hard to break the stalemate but, after some years, the proposal was - well, maybe not really dead, but at least in a coma.
That was a shame, since the problems that the directive tackles had not disappeared by far - on the contrary, in the period of enlargement of the EU.
Also, with the directive, those problems of exploitation of migrant workers are not fully solved, so we have to continue to work on this, but a temporary agency directive is a first step.
It creates clarity about the status and rights of employment of temporary agency workers by reinforcing the principle of equal treatment as the basic principle of labour law but at the same time - and no less importantly - by emphasising the role of collective bargaining and decent industrial relations in a growing and maturing temporary agency sector.
I emphasise this, and this is linked to the negative connotations of exploitation by gang masters from the organised professional temporary agency sector.
In the present directive this sector can really prove to be mature and to have a good social dialogue with trade unions, and then help reach very advanced arrangements for flexibility and security in the labour market.
<D>
in writing. - (PL) Madam President, the way events are developing, EU energy priorities - environmental protection, security and market liberalisation - continue to be important, but their hierarchy needs to be re-evaluated.
Spiralling prices for energy carriers, with social tensions and anxieties, plus the Gazprom offensive - all this requires quick reactions and exposes the need for security and cheapness of supplies.
Meanwhile, the ambitious aims set for environmental protection and the battle against global warming are of a longer-term nature and bring with them challenges that could lower the competitiveness of the European economy and multiply social tensions.
One might regret that in our circle of 27 countries there is no determination to create a common and competitive energy market.
Demonopolisation is meeting with resistance in several countries that are otherwise considered to be leaders in European integration.
There is also a lack of solidarity in contacts with external oil and gas suppliers.
Bilateral negotiations, such as those entered into in the west and the east of the European Union with Gazprom, are weakening our bargaining position.
They are making it easier to engage in energy blackmail with those Member States that were historically linked to a monopoly supplier.
Differences in national interests are making themselves felt in the construction of a single energy market.
The European Union needs proof that it will be able to arrive at satisfactory compromises despite differences.
There is no area more important than energy, in which the capacity to build unity over and above divisions must be demonstrated.

Member of the Commission. - (RO) Regulations regarding access to the international road passenger and freight transport market, together with the Regulation regarding access to the profession of road operator form a package.
These subjects are inextricably connected.
I am very pleased to see these three texts subject to a vote today in order to establish your position at a first reading.
I thank your Rapporteurs, Mrs. Ţicău and Mr. Grosch, for their work, as well as all the members who have contributed to it.
A rapid agreement is necessary for the following reasons: the European Council of March 2007 expressed its wish in this respect; the sector in question, more than 900,000 enterprises, wants to harmonise the conditions for access to the profession in order to have a loyal competition and clear rules regarding this restricted but delicate problem, namely cabotage.
15 years after the first regulations regarding access to road transport, the market continues to be fragmented, with 27 national versions of rules as regards the control of access to the profession and the definition of the good repute required for this access.
I will also remind you, one more time, of the divergent interpretations of the notion "temporary” as regards cabotage.
Consequently, it was about time to stimulate the progress in integrating the internal market in the field of road transportation.
A rapid agreement is possible.
I have the feeling that the Council's and your positions can be directed even more toward a common point.
With the help of the Slovenian and the French Presidency, I believe it is possible to reach an agreement soon.
I can assure you of my support, at least in principle, regarding most of the amendments proposed by the Committee on Transport and Tourism.
Since the detailed position of the Commission regarding each amendment submitted has already been transmitted to the relevant Parliament service, my reserves or observations will focus only on a few matters.
The first one, the matter of the cabotage, seems to be a major item of this package.
Yet, no solution will be good unless it is controllable.
The essential quality of the Commission's proposal is precisely the clarity, simplicity and controllability of the mechanism introduced: three operations within the seven days following an international transport.
This relation to an international transport is generally recognized and, exactly for this reason, I understand the interest raised by amendment 17 of the Grosch report, which provides the performance of cabotage operations in a transit country on the shortest way back.
Nevertheless, the proposed formulation makes the amendment difficult to control - and I cannot support it for this reason.
On the other hand, in order to avoid empty races, I believe we could control a provision saying that one of the three operations within seven days can be performed in a transit country within a maximum of three days.
I would have no trouble with supporting an amendment in this respect.
It is the same with amendments 18, 37, 40, 44 and 47, which provide that restrictions regarding the number and duration of cabotage operations shall be eliminated gradually, until their complete elimination in 2014.
We have to take into consideration the market reality in various Member States.
The fiscal, social, and salary conditions are still very disparate due to the absence of sufficient harmonization and I am afraid they will remain the same in 2014 as well.
The proposed package will certainly contribute to this harmonization as regards the control of access to the profession but it could not guarantee a sufficient degree of harmonization by itself.
Under these circumstances, an automatic liberalization of cabotage would result in a deformation, and not a consolidation of competition conditions.
Therefore, a clause of subsequent review of this matter seems more appropriate to me.
I mention that, until this review, it goes without saying that the regulation does not prevent Member States in any way from completely opening their cabotage markets provided that they do this without any discrimination against the other Member States or under agreements between the national governments prior to the Community rules in force regarding market access.
Amendment 21, as formulated, omits these specifications and, consequently, cannot be supported by the Commission.
As regards access to the profession, the aspect of good repute and serious infringements of the law is essential.
I believe the procedure you propose, regarding the withdrawal of good repute in case of a serious infringement of the law, has a great dissuasive power, still remaining appropriate.
I welcome in particular amendment 104 of Mrs. Ţicău's report, which provides a very clear list of these infringements.
Therefore, we can support the Parliament's proposal as regards article 6.
The European Companies Register has a special importance in guaranteeing the control of good repute.
In this respect, in principle, we support amendments 70, from 72 to 78 and 114, which provide for a rapid and progressive introduction of interconnected national registers.
Lastly, the draft regulation allows small businesses to resort to so-called external administrators.
In other words, they are administrators who do not work directly in these small businesses.
Amendment 27 does not establish limits for this possibility which, in my opinion, should remain an exception and not become a rule.
Therefore, I cannot support it.
Yet, I could support amendment 109, which provides for a reasonable limit of 50 vehicles.
Finally, as regards the issue of the 12 days, I remember the former amendment 102 in Mrs. Ţicău's report, which refers to the reintroduction of the so-called 12-day derogation in the case of coaches.
I agree with the plenary session's choice to vote this amendment in Mr. Grosch's report regarding buses.
The Commission has not adopted a position on the content for the moment.
At present, the social partners are working on this subject and we have to wait for the result of the first exchanges in order not to legislate in a hurry.
A more detailed re-examination of this matter will be necessary as soon as an agreement is reached between these partners, yet without slowing down the progress in reaching an agreement on cabotage and the register.
<D>
We apologise for the slight delay caused by the traffic.
I would recommend that everyone walk to Parliament for three reasons.
The first reason is to arrive on time.
The second is because it is healthy.
The third is that it causes less pollution.
So, let us all walk to Parliament!
The next item is the joint debate on the oral question to the Commission, by Danuta Maria Hübner, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, on EU cohesion and regional policy after 2013 - B7-0466/2010);
and the Commission statement on the future of the European Social Fund.
<D>
Let me thank the Commissioner for her response and wish her well in whatever she decides to do after this Commission.
This practice is prevalent throughout the Union, that consumers hiring a car feel they have got a reasonable deal - we understand the issue about insurance, which is all important - but are then told that they must return the car empty.
There must be some directive which the companies are breaching.
I believe it is not sufficient for the Commission to say that this can be dealt with by communicating with the consumer centre in various countries.
I think this is a major problem.
A very clear message should go out that this is extortionist.
People who go on holiday often just take a car to their destination and return; I know many of my constituents have used EUR 15 worth of petrol but it costs them EUR 60.
EUR 45 is the difference since, for the average car, it costs EUR 60 to fill the petrol tank.
This is something I believe we should deal with and I would hope that an incoming Commission and Commissioner will take responsibility for this and do something practical about it.
<D>
(HU) Mr President, Commissioner, the most important item in the budget for 2008 is cohesion policy.
In practice there are underdeveloped regions in every Member State, and so we all have an interest in this issue.
Moreover, cohesion is also in the interests of those who are involved in financing this process, and not just in the interests of the beneficiaries.
This is why we cannot accept any suggestion of making significant cuts, equivalent to around half a billion euros, to payments relating to cohesion policy.
In my view, Parliament is convinced that the new Member States will be capable of adjusting and spending all the funds available to them.
We all need to push for this in our own countries as well.
This is not the only item about which we are, and will continue to be, in disagreement with the Council.
We can also state with certainty that we have managed European citizens' money well, in other words responsibly, for the 2008 budget is much lower than the ceilings set out in the financial framework.
That is why it is disappointing that daggers are still drawn in the debate on the Galileo Programme budget or on the European Institute of Technology.
Both of these would be advantageous for the European Union's development, so why do we have to put obstacles in the way of making them a reality?
I thank the European Commission and the rapporteur for their work, and ask Parliament to support the amendments proposed by the Committee on Budgets and thereby to lend solid support to the negotiations preceding the second reading.
Lastly, Mr President, permit me to salute the Members of Parliament present today on this, my country's national holiday.
I am of course referring to the 1956 Hungarian Revolution.
Thank you for your attention.
<D>
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, 70 years ago - I have not been able to count the days - Europe, the Europe of nation states, declared that it could not and would not die for Danzig, that cowardly Europe, that anti-liberal - although formally antifascist - Europe, in its entirety, was jointly responsible for one of the two most horrific wars ever, those scars on the face of humanity.
Today, in different ways, we do not wish to die for Darfur, we did not wish to die for Yugoslavia and we do not wish to die for Tibet.
This Europe really is the Europe of nation states.
Take a fresh look at Spinelli and read the Ventotene Manifesto, listen to the words of the Dalai Lama and you will see that the choice of autonomy, the 'free Tibet for a free China' stance, represents everything that constitutes the Europe we are now losing: our European homeland, which we are sadly now once again turning into a Europe of nation states.
I therefore believe it has to be said that Mr Solana should have remained silent; he has already proclaimed 'I am going to the opening ceremony'.
Another important point is the realism shown by the Dalai Lama and by Karma Chophel, which suggests to us that we should not be raising the apocalyptic problem of non-participation in the Olympics, but taking action in the form of not endorsing the opening ceremony.
We should be saying, through Mr Solana, 'sic stantibus rebus', we are not going, rather than continuing to present this shameful spectacle.
For free China, for free Europe, free Tibet!
<D>
Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, the train accident in Buizingen on Monday, 15 February 2010 was a shocking tragedy.
I understand that in the aftermath of this serious accident, several technical and political questions concerning rail safety can be asked.
First of all, my thoughts are with the victims of this tragedy and their relatives.
It is always difficult to find words of consolation for these sad occasions and silence is sometimes more telling.
The causes of the accident are not yet fully known and the technical investigation has been launched in accordance with the provisions of the EU Safety Directive.
It is the responsibility of the Belgian investigation body to carry this out.
It should be accomplished independently of any judicial inquiry.
The objective of the technical investigation is not to apportion blame and liability, but rather to identify causes with a view to improving railway safety and the prevention of accidents.
The Belgian investigation body has asked the European Railway Agency to support it in its investigation.
Two investigators from the agency joined the Belgian team in charge of the investigation just a few hours after the accident occurred.
I would like to stress that, since the causes of the accident have not yet been clarified, it is inappropriate to draw conclusions.
Of course, I am prepared to clarify some issues, which were raised in the aftermath of this tragedy, and I will share with you my understanding of the situation.
As is too often the case when rail accidents happen, remarks alleging a link between European rules or regulations and the accident are made.
I would first like to be very clear on the opening-up of the market.
Alongside the opening-up of the rail freight sector to competition and the establishment of requirements to separate the activities of infrastructure managers and railway undertakings, a stringent regulatory framework has been introduced governing rail safety and interoperability.
We want to ensure that the high level of rail safety is maintained, while recognising the procedures and methods specific to each Member State in this area.
The European Railway Agency produces reports at regular intervals on the safety of the European network and monitors the development of the situation in the Member States.
Indicators demonstrate that the opening up of the rail sector to competition has in no way had a negative impact on railway safety.
Let me say very clearly that any proposition linking rail safety levels to the opening-up of the rail market is, in my view, just an excuse to steer the debate away from the true causes of the accident.
The question of the coexistence of national and European train control systems can be put in these terms.
More than 20 different national systems are used in Europe today to ensure the safe movement of trains.
These systems developed at national level consist of a trackside component and an onboard component.
The trackside component sends information to a computer in the train, and the computer applies the brakes when a dangerous situation is detected.
For the systems to work, trains and lines must therefore be equipped with a compatible system.
Levels of safety and performance of the various national automatic train protection systems are different, as are the rules concerning equipment of lines and locomotives in these national systems.
The incompatibility of the different national systems poses a major problem for international trains because either locomotives have to be changed at each border or they have to be equipped with as many onboard systems as there are systems on the tracks that they will run on.
There are even cases where different national systems coexist in one single country.
The Thalys, for example, has to be equipped with seven different national systems to run in four countries.
For this reason, a single system for use at European level has been designed and developed and is currently being installed on major international lines and trains in Europe.
The system is known as ERTMS - European Rail Traffic Management System.
As regards the timing, we can say that most of the national systems were developed in the early 1980s but their deployment is a long and costly process.
In most countries, only part of the national networks and locomotives are equipped today and this partial equipment took approximately 20 years.
The ERTMS specifications have been available since 2000.
A number of pilot projects were carried out between 2000 and 2005.
Since 2005, several ERTMS-equipped lines have been put into service.
At present, 10 Member States have lines with ERTMS and there are ongoing projects in almost all Member States.
In Belgium, for example, the line between Aachen and Liège is equipped, and ICT trains running on this line are equipped as well.
ERTMS was created primarily with a view to promoting interoperability.
That means the possibility for locomotives to cross borders, but it is also recognised as a system offering an advantage in terms of increased safety.
The system is fully operational today but, due to the long time needed to install it on board trains and the long lines, existing national systems will continue to coexist with ERTMS along the lines.
Third countries like Taiwan, to give just one example, have also chosen ERTMS, and not just for operability reasons.
Taiwan invested in ERTMS simply because the system is the best system available on the market today.
Several questions were asked about comparing the situation between Member States.
It is quite difficult and not very useful to establish a ranking of the Member States and make meaningful comparisons.
It all depends on the choice of indicators, the reference period and the quality of the data reported.
One or two serious accidents can also have a significant impact on whatever type of ranking we may have.
Overall data show that the Belgian performance is average.
It is true, however, that Belgium lags behind the European average in terms of tracks equipped with an automatic train protection system, be it the national or the European one.
<D>
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, network security - it sounds like a specialised field of knowledge, but the security of networks is influencing more and more aspects of our daily lives: mobile communications, the Internet, which is squeezing its way, rather like an octopus, into more and more areas of everyday activity, ambient intelligence - the computer intelligence that is built into our environments, be it to assist elderly people or to control complex work processes.
All of this shows us that we are becoming more and more dependent on such advanced forms of technology.
They rule our lives and the growth of our economy.
How dependent we have become was recently demonstrated in Estonia.
You mentioned, Commissioner, that Georgia was affected too.
People are less aware of that case, but if we had needed a more spectacular example than Estonia, we got it there.
We saw how a modern, network-driven economy suddenly became dependent on that factor, on that technology, how it was attacked and how its security really did come under very serious threat.
That is also the reason why the Commission, in which Commissioner Liikaanen held the portfolio at that time, rightly recognised the need for a network-security agency.
This is why we were taken by surprise when ENISA was evaluated after only a year, before it was fully and properly resourced, and the agency's very existence was called into question.
That certainly shocked us at the time, and I am therefore delighted that we are conducting this debate here.
Why did we call this agency into question after only a year?
How do you intend, do we intend, to fashion ENISA's mandate in such a way that it can operate like an agency that deals on equal terms with the agencies that exist in the United States, Japan and China?
I should like to thank you for your recognition, following the second evaluation, of ENISA's achievements.
Nevertheless, day after day we Members of Parliament discuss this culture shift, this climate change that affects our economies, that forces us to give up our economic dependence on fossil fuels and switch to other energy sources.
Every day we put our heart and soul into these efforts here.
We all know that changing our systems is the only option.
To that end we need intelligent solutions, and we need network security, for security is paramount.
This is why I am grateful that we are holding this debate as a building block in the construction of a more robustly resourced ENISA and of greater network security.
<D>
Mr President, regarding the report on patients' rights in cross-border health care, I would like to emphasise the issue of the right of patients to be informed about the available medication and treatment options.
European patients should have access to quality health information regarding the latest medication available, the treatment options home and abroad, the legal and financial implications of being treated abroad, the reimbursement of the treatment costs and many other areas.
For the moment, we do not have this type of quality information.
We may have some national initiatives, but nothing that could be effective at European level.
The problems we face are European.
I therefore support the idea of setting up a European health literacy network.
Such a network should consist of patients' organisations from all the Member States and should work closely with the health sector and the policy makers.
In the hope of making the Commission aware of the need to better inform the 150 million European patients, I have initiated a written declaration on health literacy.
We have all been patients at some point, and we never know when it will happen again.
<D>
(PL) Mr. President, the crisis which is increasingly taking its toll on road hauliers should caution us against introducing new charging regulations, unless what we want to do is to exacerbate the crisis.
Transport has always been the lifeblood of the whole economy.
We have had negative experience reforming the common agricultural policy, and this is likely to repeat itself now.
We must remember that road hauliers are not, in the main, vast enterprises, but small businesses with a handful of vehicles.
Let us not make them pay for the upkeep of the country.
This is already being done through tax on fuel, insurance, road checks and through many other charges.
Introducing payments for external costs would significantly increase the cost of transport and mean paying twice for the same thing.
It is clear that goods need to be transported, as there will always be producers and customers for goods which will need transporting, but do we have to make them responsible for the costs of infrastructure?
I move for the suspension of all further action until better times, or for the complete rejection of the Commission's proposal.
<D>
(PL) Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs Angelilli for tackling this very important issue.
The report before us is excellent.
It would be far better, however, if we did not have to debate this matter.
It would be so much better if we did not have to deal with people wishing to deprave and exploit children for reprehensible purposes.
I have no compunction in referring to such people as evil.
We tend to say that our children are our treasure.
All treasures have to be protected against burglars.
That is how I perceive action to protect children using modern technologies, notably the Internet.
There are children who spend several hours a day surfing the Internet.
These technologies are part of everyday life in the contemporary world.
They enable individuals to communicate more effectively and are very helpful in our daily lives.
For example, they facilitate matters in the areas of administration, science, access to culture and knowledge.
That is the positive side, which should be supported and developed.
Unfortunately, there is also a negative side that involves exploiting the Internet and modern communication technologies to disseminate harmful content, such as pornography, drug addiction, Satanism, gaming and inappropriate lifestyles.
Paedophiles use the Internet to seek out their victims.
The Internet may be likened to a knife that is useful for cutting bread, but it may also be used to inflict grievous psychological harm on children through evil content.
Several important measures are called for in my view.
Firstly, a system should be created enabling the perpetrators of such action to be detected and dealt with severely under the law.
Secondly, all those concerned should be made more aware of the dangers posed by the Internet, mobile telephony, television, and video games.
I refer to children, parents, educators, Sunday School teachers, and young people's organisations such as the Scout Movement.
Thirdly, better cooperation is needed between supervisory and follow-up bodies in the area, both in the European Union and the world over.
After all, servers putting out harmful material may be located in any country.
Finally, our actions should be of a preventive and systematic nature, and offenders should be dealt with severely.
<D>
I endorsed the report on precarious women workers.
The economic crisis has contributed to destabilisation of the labour market.
Employers have reduced employment or have employed temporary workers, offering them inferior financial terms.
The waves of redundancies, too, have meant that many people have found themselves outside the labour market.
The situation is particularly difficult for graduates, older people and women.
The crisis has exacerbated the gender inequalities that already exist in employment.
This has been particularly felt by women, who comprise the greatest percentage of workers engaged in what is known as precarious employment.
The earnings gap has become wider, and inequalities in social protection have become greater.
This situation has also hindered the professional development of women and has contributed to the consolidation of gender stereotypes in relation to work.
Therefore, women working in what is known as precarious employment deserve special protection.
Amongst other things, they should be covered by social insurance systems and legislation on job protection.
Also important is financial protection for women in the event of unemployment or maternity.
Women working in precarious employment should also have the option of unionised protection.
Furthermore, women working exclusively in private households should be guaranteed free access to advisory services in the area of social rights.
I would also like to draw attention to the necessity of regulating the legal situation of seasonal workers, who, in relation to the nature of their work, are more at risk from a variety of irregularities.
<D>
Vice-President of the Commission. - (DE) Mr President, I was going to briefly comment on your last remark, but I have decided not to.
Men are also interested in cosmetics - more and more so, in fact.
In any case, they are interested in ensuring that our cosmetic products are safe.
There is only one thing left for me to do at this point.
I would like to sincerely thank you for your agreement and support.
As Mr Davies said, we have really provided a good example of what European legislation can achieve.
If I may personally give you a piece of advice, Mr Davies, it is the following.
In your homeland it is perhaps also worth noting that we in Europe have regulations on cosmetics which do not exist elsewhere, namely the prohibition of the testing of cosmetics on animals.
That is not permitted in Europe.
Moreover, a few days ago, a regulation came into force which stipulates that products that are tested on animals cannot be placed on the European market.
Given that the British are well known for being a nation of animal lovers, this is an argument that you, too, may be able to use.
<D>
(HU) There has been much talk earlier about minorities.
I would also like to draw attention to the 50 million people with disabilities who live within the European Union.
I regard them as the biggest minority.
The financial crisis is hitting them hardest.
I want to emphasise that these people are always the first to lose their jobs, see a fall in their incomes, have few opportunities for a livelihood and experience a drop in their standard of living, not to mention the ever-dwindling support given to the social organisations representing them.
The biggest lesson from the current crisis is that it is worthwhile investing in people, including on an individual basis, even instead of other types of investment.
Political and economic decision makers have a responsibility to take heed of people with disabilities.
I ask you therefore to do everything you can for them so that they receive fairer treatment from you.
I am stressing this point because 50 million people can have a huge amount of clout within the European Union, and it is in our interest to ensure equal opportunities in society.
<D>
Ladies and gentlemen, in opening today's plenary session, I should like to say a few words about the referendum which took place last Friday.
I am very pleased with the result.
It was a great day for Ireland and a great day for Europe.
(Applause)
I would like to say that when the result was announced, I was at the other end of Europe, in Sicily, and there the result was received just as you have received it - with applause.
In many other places throughout Europe, people were also delighted with the Irish result.
The Irish have sent a clear signal that they want to continue to be at the heart of a united continent.
Míle buíochas do mhuintir na hÉireann.
A thousand thanks, and congratulations on the result of the referendum.
I said it in Irish, perhaps not very accurately, but that is more or less how it sounds.
The European Union has demonstrated that it can listen to the justified fears of its citizens and respond appropriately.
The guarantees given to Ireland proved to be satisfactory, and convinced the voters that the Treaty of Lisbon will benefit their country.
It was a victory for civil society, and is a good argument in the continuing debate in other Member States.
I would like to underline the large role played by employers, trades unions, farmers' and fishermen's organisations, and also by the Church and social leaders.
This helped to win the referendum.
I would also like to congratulate the Irish Government and opposition, and also one of my predecessors, Pat Cox, who led the 'Ireland for Europe' campaign.
Congratulations to Pat Cox!
(Applause)
I am confident that the process of ratification will be continued and will end with success in the two remaining Member States.
I have received an assurance from the President of Poland, that now, when the Irish referendum has returned a positive result, he will sign the Treaty of Lisbon without delay.
(Applause)
I hope that President Václav Klaus will do the same as soon as the Czech Constitutional Court resolves all remaining doubts.
The objective of the Treaty of Lisbon is to prepare the European Union for the challenges of the 21st century.
We have to face up to the fears of our citizens about energy issues, rising unemployment, immigration and climate change.
We will have to act together, just as we have done many times in the past, and we must not forget that the key to success is the principle of European solidarity.
There is much work before us, but we now have the essential tools, so let us not hesitate to use them.
I would like to make one more important comment on the Irish referendum.
We cannot forget those who voted 'No'.
It has become our tradition to think about all Europeans, respecting their views and their right to a different opinion.
Those who voted 'No' also want to tell us something.
They want to convince us of something, and, most important of all, they want to warn us about something.
We take that warning on board, and we will also take their vote into account, but we are extremely pleased that the decided majority of the Irish people said 'Yes', and that they support a common Europe.
I myself am determined to work hard at helping you to feel that our common Europe is also your Europe - and we will write the story of Europe's future together.
I would like to move on to two other matters.
They are sad matters.
I should like to recall a great tragedy, and in this way commemorate the victims of the mudslides in the vicinity of Messina in Sicily.
I have already issued a statement on behalf of the European Parliament, expressing our condolences to the families and friends.
I was in Italy at the time, and offered condolences publicly to our friends, partners and all Italians.
Before we begin, I would also like to recall the fact that today marks the third anniversary of the death of the Russian human rights campaigner, journalist Anna Politkovskaya.
Her murderers have still not been brought to justice.
Anna is not, however, the only victim.
Let us, on this occasion, also remember other social activists who have been murdered in the last three years.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I could not agree more with what Ms Hieronymi has said, and those 10 years of working together with her and with other Members of the Committee on Culture and Education were very efficient and, from a personal point of view, very enriching.
So, thanks to you all, from whatever parties, who have really been working for culture to become important and culture to be able to speak to the people.
I am very glad that Parliament made some proposals on the report, which are clarifications and simplifications, so they improved the proposal which I had put on the table.
As you know, the preparatory action MEDIA International has been the basis in order to develop MEDIA Mundus and, in this context, I am also grateful to Parliament for giving me EUR 2 million in 2008 and EUR 5 million in 2009 to finance preparatory action.
MEDIA Mundus will start in 2011 and will follow on from MEDIA International.
It aims at strengthening cultural and commercial relations between European film industry professionals and those from all over the world.
The concept of MEDIA Mundus is new, ambitious and innovative, because it promotes cooperation between professionals, which is not done normally by European programmes, and, unlike existing programmes, it is also based on mutual benefit, not only for our film-makers but also for film-makers from third countries, in different fields.
The first one is training, including trainees and trainers from European and third countries.
It will improve access to third-country markets and build trust and long-term commercial relationships: this is normal.
When you have been sitting together at school, training for the film industry, with somebody from Asia, somebody from Africa or from the Americas, it is clear that, later on in your professional life, you have an impetus to work together.
That is also why we support the organisation of forums for international co-productions.
We train them together, and then we expect those professionals start to work together.
So we need the forums for international co-productions.
Then we have to improve the distribution, circulation and visibility of European audiovisual arts in third countries.
That is always a win-win situation for people from third countries within Europe.
Here is a very good example of a Europe which is not a fortress Europe but an open Europe, a Europe which gives, which takes, which shares.
We have to improve public demand for culturally diverse audiovisual content, which will be very important, so we have to get the youth, the young public most of all, to see European films.
I am very confident that MEDIA Mundus will increase consumer choice, so that people will have the possibility to watch European films.
It will bring cultural diversity to European markets by getting more quality films from smaller markets outside Europe into Europe, and it will give a chance to European films on the international market.
So it will create new business opportunities for professionals from Europe and around the globe.
This is, of course, a very important economic contribution.
It is a question of competitiveness, but it is most of all a question of cultural diversity - our cultural diversity - which is our most precious good, and the cultural diversity of those who live in other continents, which is their most special good.
To share those is a wonderful chance, which will be built up by MEDIA Mundus.
<D>
Mr President, why is it so very important that we should make such an effort and hold this debate, especially now, on the subject of the symbols of the European Union?
I believe that there are two reasons.
Firstly, we as the European Parliament must show in the way we habitually go about our business that the EU is about more than just legal texts.
Let me remind you that, as the rapporteur has said, the symbols originate from the Constitutional Treaty.
An attempt was made to institutionalise them, but it is very significant that today we are continuing this effort to keep them alive.
Why?
Because they happen to show that Europe is not built on flawed legal texts, which are necessary but are difficult for the various nations to understand.
They happen to symbolise something else, and how appropriate that fine Greek verb is here: a political project, an idea of Europe.
As such, I think it must be kept alive, especially today.
The second reason lies in what the symbols conceal - the symbols behind the symbols: in other words, the idea of the EU's common action based on its values.
That is what the symbols are: a common action based on values that we need now more than ever.
Thus if we say that the crisis we are all experiencing - and I am referring not only to the economic crisis, but also to Europe's present institutional and moral crisis - is a symbol of these difficult times, I think the EU's response must be united action.
This means that we could potentially all move forward together.
I believe there could not be a more apt and at the same time more bitter example than that of Iceland today.
This country does not belong to the EU, but it is so buffeted by the economic storm that its people are wondering whether they should indeed be part of this 'Europe of ideas'.
<D>
Caring has been the domain of women for centuries.
Ideal mothers who spent their youth caring for their children represent today the majority of the elderly female population and it is this childcare and homecare that is not reflected in their pensions.
Many of them do not receive an appropriate pension for this socially valuable work during their active life and this exposes them to a greater risk of poverty.
This is also a reason why young women are postponing motherhood and giving priority to a professional career.
During my many speeches in the House, I have constantly emphasised that mothers and fathers who freely choose to bring up their children or to care for elderly or dependent family members must not suffer discrimination.
I know many families who have disabled relatives and carry out this demanding work with great courage despite the obstacles they constantly have to overcome.
In this speech, I should like to praise the proposals made by the rapporteur Mrs Anna Záborská, which recommend recognition not only of traditional forms of gainful employment but also of the manifold forms of non-gainful employment carried out in families as part of inter-generational solidarity.
This work is reflected in the GDP if a family employs someone.
However, it is not the case if one of the parents carries out this work.
I believe that the report will inspire Member States to adopt measures to improve family policy within the EU.
<D>
I support without hesitation Mr Gauzès's report.
He has again shown his qualities as a negotiator.
It is fortunate that a compromise could be reached quickly on this text.
By providing itself with a regulatory framework for rating agencies, Europe is in the forefront and showing the way, whilst the United States has still not reacted practically in this area.
Part of the credibility of and the confidence in the capital markets relies on the ratings produced and published by these agencies.
The regulatory framework that we are establishing today should be able to improve the conditions in which these ratings are prepared, provided they are used in a supervisory framework for regulated activities.
However, it was important for the compromise not to take the form of solutions that merely aimed at prohibiting any reference to ratings in any context whatsoever, where the latter had not been established in the framework of this regulation.
Besides it being somewhat detrimental to the major freedoms, such as freedom of expression and of trade, such an approach would probably have favoured non-European markets, to the detriment of those domiciled in Europe, and would probably also have favoured private and confidential financial transactions, to the detriment of public transactions subject to rules on transparency.
The chosen solution, therefore, has my full approval.
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, you had an excellent team in Bali.
They worked until they dropped, and I ask you to convey these thanks to your staff.
As a European patriot, I believe that the real success of Bali lies in the absolutely crucial decisions taken by the European Union last March in favour of a trio of 20% reductions, and that is the basis on which our lives will be lived in this continent in the coming years.
I do not intend to deal with the various successes achieved in Bali, because my fellow Members will no doubt see to that.
I am pleased that, besides making progress with the United States, we were also able to ensure that, in addition to the 38 countries which have already signed the Kyoto Protocol, the closest G77 countries are now committed to doing something rather than constantly lamenting the fact that every government is waiting for the others to act.
This cat-and-mouse game is over.
That breakthrough, incidentally, could not have been achieved without the help of the United States.
Allow me, Commissioner and Mr President-in-Office, just to say a few words on the things that will exercise us in this debate.
We learned in Bali that we fall short if we confine all our discussions to CO2.
I believe we need to develop far greater awareness of the sustainability debate, and it has also become apparent that we have more than just a climate crisis but also a raw-materials crisis, but even that can be turned to advantage.
I believe we must associate the concept of sustainability far more closely with our objectives in this field in order to heighten awareness.
But that, of course, brings me straight to the Council, Mr President-in-Office.
We are already observing our Member States starting to baulk at the 20/20/20 goals and trying to move heaven and earth to avoid having to achieve them.
I believe you face an extremely formidable challenge as you strive, together with us, to achieve these goals, for when the show moves on to Poznań and thereafter to another northern country, we shall have to stand our ground.
I hope that the Commission and Parliament will be the guarantors of further progress on this issue.
<D>
(PT) Only a few months ago, some were saying that the Treaty of Lisbon would never come into force.
Yet here we are, beginning to think about how we are going to implement it and laying down some of its provisions.
The Treaty of Lisbon has an important contribution to make in fighting the democratic deficit.
I am talking about the strengthening of parliaments (both the European Parliament and national parliaments).
Even more importantly, I am talking about investment in a Europe for the public, with rules on the area of freedom, security and justice, on monitoring subsidiarity, and with the realisation of this innovative initiative which stems from public action.
I endorse what has been said by many of my fellow Members and especially by my colleague, Mr Méndez de Vigo, but I would like to emphasise that when regulating this instrument, we must ensure that it is truly Europe-wide.
It needs, of course, to avoid being the expression of the will of the public in only one country or a limited number of countries.
We do, however, need to seek a solution that will encourage and stimulate public involvement.
If we have to choose between being very strict and rigorous or being more generous, I would err on the side of being more generous.
If we come up with solutions that discourage public participation, we are betraying the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon and denying the European public because, ladies and gentlemen, we need more Europe and a Europe that is aimed more at the public.
We need the European public to have greater involvement and to actively exercise their citizenship.
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, first of all, I should like to thank Mr Graça Moura most sincerely on behalf of my group, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, for his excellent report.
Thank you, too, to the Commission for presenting this communication on the European agenda for culture.
It can count on Parliament's support for culture as a horizontal task, for increasing artists' mobility, for increasing regional cooperation and for strengthening international cooperation.
However, we also note the absence of something on this agenda.
This is a subject we discussed in detail a little while ago.
The cultural industries and their growing significance also mean that the economic aspects are becoming considerably stronger than has been the case in the past.
The agenda for culture is not only about issues of better cooperation on the cultural agenda or of increased funding, but also of the legal framework.
In that regard, it is indeed true even within the European Union that, if culture is in competition with internal market law or competition law, it always draws the short straw in case of doubt.
You will all remember the Lévai report: the Commissioner for the Internal Market and Services described collective management societies for online music as obstacles to competition on the internal market.
Here culture clearly draws the shorter straw and is in a weaker position than European internal market law.
Hence the urgent need, and tomorrow Parliament will decide the same way as the Committee on Culture and Education.
The Unesco Convention must be applied not only to securing cultural diversity with regard to third countries, but also as a matter of the utmost urgency in our own European law.
Our heartfelt plea to the Commissioner, therefore, is that we have just one time slot, and therefore need a proposal quickly for strengthening cultural diversity in European internal market law.
<D>
Madam President, we are in the middle of a vicious circle now in the sense that, when the economy becomes negative, financial institutions get further losses on their balance sheets, which means that there will be further strains on the interbank market, which leads to further credit constraints, which leads to further negative growth.
People will not be capable of understanding how we can use taxpayers' money to save the banks and not use taxpayers' money to create some jobs.
That is why I would focus today on how to reassess this credit crunch, but also - and first and foremost - the recession we are in the middle of.
As I see it we are at risk of negative growth next year in the European Union as such of -1% - not only -0.3%, but -1%.
If we take that prospect - which is not unlikely - our aim and our duty are to avoid that recession.
Minus one percent next year will correspond to a Growth and Stability Pact of more than -3%.
My point is that we cannot save the Growth and Stability Pact by doing nothing.
It will get worse if we do not do something.
Now, what something can we do?
I know it is not easy.
I know there is disagreement among governments, but I think that the Commission has a duty to try to bring all the governments together to get one easy job done.
I know that in Berlin you are saying 'no thanks' to coordination because that means further expenditure from the German Government to other governments.
I would say that you do not need to do that, dear friends in Berlin.
We can do things together without having further expenditure from one government to others.
It is about understanding that by investing at the same moment in time in the next couple of years you will have added value.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has made one simple calculation.
Imagine that the G20, all of them, invest just 1% more of their GDP in jobs.
If they do that simultaneously then there will be an extra percent for free.
So what I am saying is that every government in Europe can make it, if they do it together.
If every government in Europe were to invest 1% of their GDP to counteract the recession, were to do it intelligently, and were to do it socially for more and better jobs, caring for the most vulnerable groups, then they will have an extra percent for free.
That is why I simply must appeal to the Commission, Vice-President Wallström, asking you to present one simple scenario showing what would happen if all our major governments were to do what I am saying here, showing that all of them will be better off, not only in jobs, but also in public budgets and also in the Growth and Stability Pact.
It is a simple exercise.
If you do not have the instruments, I have.
I would willingly advise you how to do it.
(Applause)
<D>
Mr President, I am very glad that the Commissioner has today addressed the much wider crisis in this sector, which has been compounded by the steep rise in diesel cost.
As Mr Titford just said - and I rarely agree with him, but I do in this case - in some fishing nations the huge cost of fuel has followed in the wake of dwindling quotas and falling prices for fish.
The situation is so bad that some crew in the UK now are earning less than GBP 100 a week, and that is driving hundreds of them to leave the industry at exactly the time that we need more young recruits joining the industry.
Many vessels, as everyone in this Chamber knows, can no longer afford to put to sea.
They lose money on every trip they make.
Angry fishermen are blockading ports; striking lorry drivers are refusing to carry freight: and that means the markets for fish are being completely disrupted at the most productive time of the year.
But I am greatly encouraged by the provisions and the proposals that Commissioner Borg has unveiled to us this afternoon.
Those Member States who submit proposals for fleet adjustment schemes or for the complete restructuring of their fisheries sector can receive aid from the European Fisheries Fund, and this will go a long way to alleviating the acute crisis affecting the sector at the present time.
I am deeply ashamed that the British Government is refusing to accept this aid, refusing to apply for this co-financed aid.
It is atrocious that our fishermen should end up fishing in the same water for the same species as fishermen from other neighbouring nations who will be receiving this aid.
That further distorts the market.
So we need to support the creation of a smaller, more fuel-efficient fleet that is better matched to fishing possibilities.
I think what the Commission is proposing will achieve that.
<D>
The text to be put to the vote tomorrow constitutes a clear step backwards, not only in relation to the Commission's initial proposal, but above all in relation to the work done within the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, of which I am a member.
We socialists are in favour of introducing minimum rules concerning the return of illegally staying nationals because we support a responsible, humane approach to illegal immigration and realise that some EU Member States are pursuing unacceptable policies in this area from the point of view of respect for fundamental rights.
We have no choice, however, but to point out that the compromise supported by the conservatives and the majority of the liberals does not bring any improvements in this area.
It does not apply either to asylum seekers or to those people intercepted at borders.
Above all, it gives Member States far too much leeway on key issues such as the rights of minors and detention periods.
Accordingly, the detention period could be extended to as much as 18 months.
Like many of my fellow Members, I refuse to support the possibility of locking up, for such a long time, people whose only crime is to have wanted to seek a better life in Europe.
That is why, if the amendments of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament are rejected, I will vote according to my conscience and against this text.
<D>
I fully support the Hungarian Presidency's priorities on account of their pro-European nature and similarity to the interests of the EU as a whole.
I represent the country which will take over the Presidency next, and I should like to make it known that we will cooperate closely with the Hungarian Presidency.
Good cooperation will facilitate smooth hand-overs of the Presidency between the Polish-Cypriot-Danish trio.
I am particularly pleased at Hungary's declaration regarding its commitment to the development of the Eastern Partnership and the European Neighbourhood Policy.
Similarly, I would like to express my delight at the fact that EU enlargement is one of the Hungarian Presidency's priorities.
The fact that Hungary and Poland hold such similar positions on EU enlargement should help ensure continuity during the Polish Presidency as far as this issue is concerned.
I hope that the Eastern Partnership summit to be held in May will not merely summarise the implementation of this initiative over the two years of its existence, but that it will bring tangible results with regard to visa-free travel, trade and energy.
Similarly to the Hungarian Presidency, Poland believes that there is a need for a joint approach to freedom and justice, by strengthening the protection of personal data and promoting civil rights and common values throughout the EU.
One of the priorities calls for the sustainable use of resources, thus acting as a continuation of the goals of the previous Spanish and Belgian Presidencies, and reflecting the Commission's extensive efforts in this area.
It is vital for planned measures to take into account the diverse conditions and potentials which exist in the Member States.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, eyewitnesses are reporting a speeding incident which almost defies belief, involving Harald Rømer, the Secretary-General of the European Parliament, at around 3 p.m. on 14 November this year, apparently in a Luxembourg-registered CD vehicle which was travelling from the European Parliament into the centre of Strasbourg.
Sparrows were crushed beneath his wheels as he roared along the Allée de la Robertsau, blasting past slow-moving vehicles in traffic queues at speeds of more than 100 km/hour and forcing startled pedestrians to leap to safety off the zebra crossing.
I therefore have a few questions to ask Mr Rømer: were you indeed travelling in this vehicle at the time?
Who was at the wheel?
What instructions had you - or had you not - given to the driver?
Why was the vehicle in question being driven in such a reckless manner, and why was the speed limit exceeded so dramatically?
Do you think that traffic regulations do not apply to you?
Would you not say that as the European Parliament's most senior official, you should be showing special consideration to others and keeping within the limits of traffic law?
Is this how you intend to behave in future, and should all road-users run in fear from you?
<D>
Despite the cold being felt inside this chamber, this topic will deal with countries boasting far warmer temperatures, which is rather more ideal.
These reports, in fact, consist of an agreement which provides for a short stay visa waiver between the European Union and its citizens and the citizens of six different countries - The Republic of Mauritius, The Republic of Seychelles, Barbados, The Federation of St Kitts and Nevis, the Bahamas as well as Antigua and Barbuda.
This waiver applies to European Union citizens who travel to these countries and vice-versa, that is, when citizens from these countries travel to the European Union.
It is valid for a maximum stay of three months within a six month period.
This waiver covers all categories of persons, meaning ordinary citizens as well as diplomats travelling for various reasons.
This applies particularly to the numerous tourists who are European Union citizens and who go on holiday to these six countries, and thus we will be greatly facilitating things for them.
This agreement however, specifically excludes those who travel for work and remuneration purposes.
In these reports, we have included a provision that says that each of these third countries can suspend or terminate this agreement with regard to all countries of the European Union rather than excluding individual countries.
This was done in order to safeguard a level playing field for of all European Union citizens and, beyond that, as an expression of solidarity.
On the other hand, the European Union will do the same, meaning that the European Community can also suspend or terminate an agreement on behalf of all its Member States.
The European Union or any of these countries can either suspend the whole agreement or parts of it, on grounds of public interest, protection of national security, public health protection, illegal immigration or in the case of a country's re-introduction of a visa obligation.
Above all, I would like to clarify, Madam President, that before taking a vote on these reports at committee level, we asked for and were given a guarantee on the part of the European Commission that full reciprocity would be ensured.
This was an essential principle for us; full reciprocity assured by these countries in the removal of their visa requirement whilst we would do the same in turn.
Thus, we would be eliminating visa requirements on both sides.
This agreement has been achieved in the requisite manner and once again clearly demonstrates how the European Union is capable of negotiating with one voice on an international level and by showing solidarity towards all countries.
I will conclude by saying that once more, this illustrates the European Union's capacity to open its doors to citizens worldwide.
<D>
on behalf of the PSE. - (RO) The Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation No 11 concerning the abolition of discrimination in transport rates and conditions requires land, rail or waterborne freight carriers operating within the Community to provide information on their rates, applicable agreements, terms of carriage, as well as the necessary documentation.
Thus, operators are forbidden to discriminate by applying differential rates (with reference to the same product being carried in the same transportation system on the same route), but discriminations are created according to the country of destination or of origin.
This is a very important Regulation, but as it had been in force since 1960, it needed updating.
The draft amendment simplifies existing legislation and ensures more stability in the conditions applicable to the transportation of goods.
According to the statistics provided by the Commission, it is true, as the Commissioner said, that the Regulation will affect or will have some bearing on the activity of some 300 thousand transport operators, and this amendment will reduce Europe-wide administrative expenditure by some €160 million/year.
The European Parliament intends to reduce by 25% the administrative burden on enterprises by the year 2012.
The proposal for the amendment of the two Regulations, as put forward to the Commission, is among the measures designed to achieve that objective.
It is true, however, that the Committee on Transport was notified in the codecision procedure, which is contrary to Article 73(3) of the Treaty.
Hence the proposal put forward by Mr Costa as rapporteur was adopted unanimously.
<D>
(BG) Mr. President, colleagues, the bridge is a symbol of unification, it is carried by every banknote from EUR 50 to 5.
There is, however, a bridge in Europe which, although it is called Bridge of Friendship, still divides people.
It is the only bridge between Bulgaria and Romania along the 350 km river border on the Danube.
To cross it both ways costs nearly EUR 17.
The fee is illegitimate and hinders both business and the free movement of people.
It does not reflect the real costs for maintenance of the bridge.
In 2007, EUR 12 million were collected on the Bulgarian side while only EUR 17,000 were invested in the maintenance of the bridge.
I am convinced that if the European Court is notified it will rule against this fee.
But why should the citizens of Rousse and Giurgiu wait for that?
I appeal to the Bulgarian and the Romanian authorities to respond to the expectations of the citizens by waiving the fee for crossing the bridge between Rousse and Giurgiu.
I am also turning to the Commission to encourage the finding of a solution to this pressing public problem.
<D>
Madam President, today we are having a debate on the EU-China summit, which took place 10 days ago, and on the 24th Round of the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue, which took place two months ago.
Especially today, let me start with the second one.
Respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms is a core principle of the EU and its policies and it is something that we all strongly care about and support.
But I am one of those who believe that the EU should follow a result-oriented approach in promotion of respect for human rights rather than a purely principled one and, most importantly, we have to accept that the improvements will only come step-by-step.
That does not mean that the EU should hesitate in voicing its criticism and using its power to insist upon democratic reforms.
I am also one of those who care about the high-level product safety that affects 550 million European citizens; who care about trade imbalance, effective market access, intellectual property rights and international competition policies that affect thousands of European companies and millions of European employees; and who care about cooperation on environment protection, international environment governance and climate change that affects the whole population of the Earth.
Because we care about all the above, we strongly support the Commission and Council and its Presidency for addressing, negotiating and stressing continuously each one of the issues in regular dialogue with the Chinese side.
A simple reading of the 18-page joint statement of the last EU-China summit is enough to understand that the complexity, sensitivity and importance in the EU-China cooperation...
(The President cut off the speaker)
<D>
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PL) Mr President, a year has not yet passed and this is the third time that we have debated the situation in Burma.
We are again calling on the government in that country to respect human rights and basic humanitarian standards for the treatment of prisoners.
We point out the injustices, we make appeals, we make requests, we lament the situation, we impose sanctions and, once again, we condemn the regime in Burma.
In turn, that regime displays an astonishing immunity to pressure from the international community, ignores the appeals, just does not do anything about them.
For this reason it is with some embarrassment that I am standing up to speak about Burma.
I see our impotence to date, not just ours, that is, of the European Parliament and the European Union, but also of all assemblies including the United Nations.
For this reason I think the time for words is over.
We should make strong demands for diplomatic pressure to be exerted so that, through the diplomatic channels of the Council of the European Union and Member States, the regime should be forced to act properly.
I would like to call for the adoption of points seven and ten of the resolution, which appeal for a process of national reconciliation in that country.
<D>
rapporteur. - (RO) Madam President, the Treaty of Lisbon, which entered into force on 1 December 2009, extended the circumstances in which Parliament's consent was required for the conclusion of international agreements.
Air transport agreements now fall within this category because they cover a field which the ordinary legislative procedure applies to.
Prior to the current agreement, aviation was the subject of bilateral agreements with 19 of the EU Member States.
I am referring by this to the agreements between the European Union and Canada.
Many of these agreements contained numerous restrictions and did not offer full access to the respective markets.
In November 2002, the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that certain provisions in these bilateral agreements were incompatible with Community law.
The negotiating mandate sets the objective of establishing an open aviation area between the European Union and Canada.
This would create a single market for air transport between the European Union and Canada where investment could flow freely and where European and Canadian airlines would be able to provide air services without any restriction, including in the domestic markets of both parties.
The EU-Canada Air Transport Agreement was initialled on 30 November 2008, endorsed by the EU-Canada summit on 6 May 2009 and signed on 17-18 December 2009.
What is the content of the agreement?
The agreement includes a gradual phasing-in of traffic rights and investment opportunities, as well as far-reaching cooperation on a number of issues including safety, security, social matters, consumer interests, the environment, air traffic management, state aid and competition.
All European Union airlines will be able to operate direct flights to Canada from anywhere in Europe.
The agreement removes all restrictions on routes, prices or the number of weekly flights between Canada and the European Union.
Airlines are free to enter into commercial arrangements such as code-share agreements, which are important for airlines serving a large number of destinations, and to set their fares in line with competition law.
The agreement contains provisions for opening the market in phases.
Phase one applies where the foreign ownership of airlines is limited to 25%, as was the case when the negotiations on the agreement were completed.
Phase two starts as soon as Canada has taken the necessary steps to enable European investors to own up to 49% of Canadian carriers' voting equity.
Phase three begins once both sides introduce the possibility for investors to set up and control new airlines in each others' markets.
Phase four is the final step with full rights to operate between, within and beyond both markets, including between places in the territory of the other party.
I am referring here to cabotage.
I would like to mention a few points about this report.
Although this agreement is more ambitious than that with the US regarding market access, it is less explicit when it comes to recognising the importance of the social dimension.
It is important that the Commission uses the agreement and, in particular, the possibility of reference to the Joint Committee, to promote compliance with relevant international legislation on social rights, especially the labour standards embodied in the fundamental conventions of the International Labour Organisation.
Given the important role played by the Joint Committee, including in politically sensitive matters such as environmental and labour standards, it is important that the Commission ensures that Parliament is kept fully informed and consulted about the Committee's work and also about future amendments to the Treaty.
<D>
(EL) Mr President, this report on urban mobility forms an important part of viable mobility in Europe and an integral part of the strategy for achieving sustainable growth and the Lisbon objectives.
The challenge is for innovative actions to be adopted and legislative measures to be taken that will significantly improve the quality of life of citizens in cities.
It is a fact that the daily lives of European citizens have become considerably more difficult as a result of stress from travelling, congestion, pollution, noise and the deterioration in the environment.
A balance therefore needs to be struck between the ambition, on the one hand, to develop the common transport policy as a right to mobility and as an important part of economic growth and, on the other hand, an integrated approach that will improve traffic congestion and make a drastic contribution towards combating climate change.
In brief, that will promote a more humane life.
We need to develop combined means of transport as quickly as possible and give citizens information on all urban transport networks, so that they are in a position to choose.
I too should like to congratulate the rapporteur on his very good and substantial report and to ask the European Commission not to waste any time or effort in preparing the action plan.
<D>
in writing. - (PT) It would seem that the European Parliament has approved (?) the 'Charter of Fundamental Rights' (CFR) for the second time, seven years on from the first.
We should note here that the CFR was drafted by a so-called 'convention', created for the purpose, which reached a consensus based on the lowest common denominator under pressure from forces advocating the most reactionary positions, namely the British Labour government, led by Tony Blair.
The outcome of this procedure is a CFR that is much weaker on social rights than, for example, the Constitution of the Portuguese Republic or the European Social Charter, which Portugal has ratified.
For example, the defence of the right to work clearly and explicitly enshrined in the Constitution of the Portuguese Republic (Article 58) and the European Social Charter (Article 1) is 'adapted' and 'modernised' in the CFR and becomes the 'right to engage in work.'
There are other examples, as can be seen in the 'explanations prepared under the authority of the Praesidium of the Convention which drafted the Charter and updated under the responsibility of the Praesidium of the European Convention' that drafted the 'European constitution'.
These 'explanations' are fundamental for interpretation of the content of the CFR but almost never accompany it.
I wonder why?
<D>
Madam President, in the discussion on the subject of the crimes of totalitarian regimes a great deal of time is devoted to the victims, while surprisingly little is said about those who sacrificed their lives fighting against Nazism and Communism.
I would like once again to recall a man who should become a symbol of an unshakeable attitude and resistance to totalitarians - Cavalry Captain Witold Pilecki.
He voluntarily entered the Auschwitz extermination camp to organise the resistance movement and gather information about mass murders.
He managed to escape, only to die several years later from a bullet in the back of the head, dispatched on the orders of Soviet butchers.
I therefore also appeal once again for 25 May, the date of his execution, to be designated the International Day of the Heroes of the Fight Against Totalitarianism, because many unknown people, who just like Pilecki lost their lives in the fight for fundamental rights and freedoms, deserve to be remembered.
I should like to add one further comment.
Yesterday in Parliament we celebrated the European Day of home-made ice cream.
I repeat, we celebrated the European Day of home-made ice cream.
I do not therefore understand why 25 May cannot be the day when we remember the heroes of the fight against totalitarianism.
<D>
The objective of the present proposal relates to the simplification of the business environment and, in particular, the requirements for the provision of financial information by micro-enterprises, with the aim of strengthening their competitiveness and potential for growth.
In this context, I welcome the changes included in the report regarding the reduction in the administrative burden on micro-enterprises, as I believe that it constitutes an important measure in stimulating the European economy and in combating the crisis.
This is because the activities of micro-enterprises are confined to single local or regional markets in which the production of annual accounts becomes an onerous and complex undertaking.
However, I do not support the idea of exempting micro-enterprises from the duty to submit annual accounts.
That decision, in fact, falls to each Member State to adopt, as it could have direct implications relating to the combating of fraud and tax evasion and the fight against economic and financial crime, as well as for the protection of shareholders and creditors.
I therefore argue for the finding of balanced solutions with a view to adapting the way this measure is applied, rather than having a specific obligation in the document to maintain accounts regarding commercial operations and the financial position.
It is, therefore, with some reservations that I am voting in favour of the present report.
<D>
The Treaty of Lisbon, which is 96 per cent identical to the draft Constitutional Treaty, was rejected by the referendum in Ireland.
Prior to that, the draft Constitutional Treaty was rejected in referendums in France and the Netherlands.
The majority in this Parliament refuses to acknowledge its political losses.
This is an outrageous crime against democratic principles and an equally outrageous example of the arrogance of power that characterises cooperation in the EU.
Mr Brok's report praises the Convention that produced a draft Constitutional Treaty.
This Convention has been heavily criticised for having been entirely undemocratic and controlled from the top by its chairman Giscard d'Estaing.
In my opinion, Mr Brok's report should have come to the conclusion that, for as long as the political debates of representative democracy are focused on the elections to the national parliaments, it should be the national parliaments that are the highest decision-making bodies within the Union - not the European Parliament.
I have voted against the report.
<D>
(RO) I refute the accusations levelled by my fellow Members, Csaba Sógor and László Tőkés, against Romania.
Romania is a Member State of the European Union, NATO, the Council of Europe, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe and respects, in accordance with European standards, human rights and the rights of persons belonging to national minorities.
Romania applies the letter and spirit of all the relevant international treaties in this area.
The Hungarian language is used by law for administrative matters in any location and county where those belonging to the Hungarian minority account for more than 20% of the population.
This is a de facto and de jure situation.
Romania offers extensive educational opportunities for Hungarians in their mother tongue in nurseries, primary schools, secondary schools, vocational colleges, university faculties, right up to master and doctorate level.
In the areas where ethnic Hungarians live alongside Romanians, it is a well-observed rule that schools operate sections where the language of instruction is Hungarian for all children of Hungarian origin.
Just in case they have also somehow forgotten, the Babeş-Bolyai University in Cluj-Napoca has three sections offering instruction in Romanian, Hungarian and German respectively, plus the flourishing development of Jewish studies at the institution, as well as special places for Roma.
<D>
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, what the European Parliament is engaged in here today, with this debate and subsequent vote, is nothing less than a massive exercise in deceit.
A pack of lies is being told because you do not want the peoples of Europe to have the referendums that you promised them.
This represents an imposition of the will of the political class upon the citizens.
We all know the truth, which is that the Lisbon Treaty is the same as the EU Constitution - with exactly the same number of new competences and exactly the same number of surrenders of veto.
It is virtually identical in every regard and it is a constitutional treaty, because it gives the European Union full legal personality, and, worse still, gives it the ability to amend itself in the future without having to refer to any more intergovernmental conferences.
It gives the EU the ability to legislate over literally every single aspect of our lives.
I am told, though, that I should not worry, because the flag and the anthem have been dropped.
Well, pull the other one!
There is a great big flag in front of us here.
It is nonsense.
It is all part of the lie.
The truth is that you are too chicken to have a referendum.
You do not want to hear the voice of the people, and now you are resorting to totalitarian means to get this Treaty through.
We heard Mr Cohn-Bendit say that those who oppose this Treaty are mentally ill.
We heard Mr Schulz say that those of us who objected to the sheer dishonesty of this project were behaving like Nazis back in the 1930s.
Well, I think the ordinary decent citizens of Europe will work out for themselves who the extremists are.
I must say that I wish the people of Ireland, and those who believe in democracy, every success in a couple of months' time.
I hope they send out a large resounding 'no', and I hope the voice of the peoples of Europe will be heard, and not just your voice, the voice of the political class.
You may be complacent today, but you are increasingly being held in contempt.

The financial crisis has paralysed credit; it has affected businesses and families; and demand has plummeted, with disastrous consequences for economic growth and employment.
Such a situation justifies exceptional measures, particularly in the case of strategic sectors such as car manufacturing, which represents 6% of jobs.
Even so, almost all the European Economic Recovery Plan, for which I have the honour of being this Parliament's rapporteur, is based entirely on national initiatives.
In reality, how can the Commission guarantee that it is out there checking coordination and that countries are not embarking on a war of support measures?
What mechanisms are out there to safeguard jobs in countries that do not have the financial structure to guarantee the jobs that are vital to them?
For some countries, textiles or electronics may be just as important as car making.
What action can be expected?
Will the Commission be more alert to the role of European industry in Europe's survival?
There are limits to what can be expected from the European Investment Bank.
Will we have a budget equal to the challenges facing Europe?
<D>
in writing. - (DE) In one of the amendments tabled on this report, an attempt is made to secure the European Parliament's support for European minimum wages.
In my view, this approach is fundamentally wrong.
The conditions and parameters in place in the individual regional labour markets are so disparate that a European approach will not enable us to increase prosperity for citizens; instead, we would be entrenching poverty, unemployment and black-market work.
There is also a call for minimum wages to be set at no less than 50-60% of the average national wage.
Which country in Europe has such a high minimum wage?
Before tabling this type of amendment for debate, its initiators should at least make the effort to look at the reality in Europe.
An attempt is being made here to champion a European wage-setting policy which would increase existing national minimum wages by an average of 20%.
This is blatant populism!
I hope that a clear majority will emerge in Parliament to quash these dangerously utopian ideas, which would merely increase joblessness and poverty and put Europe's economic competitiveness at risk.
<D>
(NL) Mr President, instead of all manner of ineffectual taxes and charges, the Commission is proposing the present market-based instrument; a choice I endorse wholeheartedly.
It is environmentally effective, economically efficient and eminently suitable for broader application; at least, it has the potential to be all of these things.
It became clear quite early on that opinions in this House are somewhat divided.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety ended up diametrically opposed to the Committee on Transport and Tourism.
My colleague Mr Krahmer has said all that needs to be said about that.
Compromise amendments have now been drawn up, and tomorrow's vote will show whether or not emotion leads the way.
Climate issues are hot, and voting Green is extremely sexy.
There is not so much wrong with that in itself, but as I see it, a stranglehold on the European aviation sector and the associated employment cannot be the intention.
I consider it counterproductive to attempt to artificially diminish one particular mode of transport, in this case aviation, in favour of another.
All the evidence suggests that demand for high-speed transport outstrips supply.
We need all modes of transport; we really cannot manage with trains and buses alone.
The aim was to develop a model that was as workable as possible and could be extended and/or copied worldwide - and, yes, if we really want to be environmentally effective, the latter is of vital importance.
If not, our efforts will remain just a tiny drop in the proverbial ocean, and that is what I should like to avoid.
Mr Rack put it so aptly when he said just now that, to be effective, we have to persuade the rest of the world, as only then will our action be of any use.
<D>
The European economy is suffering the effects of the global financial crisis, seeing the greatest and most serious decline in the last 60 years.
The crisis is an enormous test for Europe.
It affects companies and, at the same time, ordinary people and their families.
Many are living in fear, particularly of losing their jobs, and are looking to the EU to save them.
Europe cannot just be the sum of 27 national interests.
It must be based on solidarity and the willingness of Member States and regions to implement their programme objectives as quickly as possible.
At a time of economic crisis, it should be clear to us that we must concentrate on the Lisbon objectives, particularly in the area of employment.
It is cohesion policy that has the financial instruments which must be applied intensively and flexibly during the crisis.
The financial resources of EU Cohesion Policy for the period 2007-2013 can significantly help to fulfil the objectives of the EU's renewed Lisbon Strategy for growth and employment, which brings together ordinary people, companies, infrastructure, the energy sector and research and innovation.
We need to improve coordination and to abandon protectionism and all forms of demagoguery.
We must restart capital flows and capital transfers.
I firmly believe that investments in innovation, new technologies and eco-innovations will bring the new opportunities which are essential for securing an effective response to the current financial crisis.
We must eliminate all barriers and create a genuine internal market in renewable energy.
<D>
Madam President, thank you, Commissioner, for your response.
I am also a member of the Committee on Transport and Tourism and I think it is very important that we have this issue on the agenda now.
Indeed, Mr Simpson has already presented it to us.
As it stands, there is a gap in consumer protection where air passengers are concerned.
This gap relates to the insolvency of airlines, as has already been discussed.
In my opinion, it is extremely important to uphold consumer rights, and that is what we are doing.
We are trying to protect consumers as far as possible.
I would like to mention one other aspect from the point of view of our group which has not been a factor in this up to now, but which I think is also an important consideration.
Of course, we want consumer rights to be protected, but we also want consumers to have choice.
When considering how we can close this gap, it may well be the case that a proposal that you draw up in the Commission will result in over-regulation, which may then hinder innovation when it comes to the options offered in this area.
Consumer law also means, of course, that there should be a choice between various different offers from airlines, for example.
Thus, the trend now, for example, is for some very cheap flights to be on offer in place of some flat-rate journeys, something which is also very much welcomed by consumers.
Please do not misunderstand me; I do not want to diminish consumer rights in any way.
Protection of these rights, too, is very important to me, and we do need an appropriate instrument to do this.
However, we should consider the perspectives that we need to take into account to ensure that there indeed remains a large degree of choice when it comes to air travel and that new options can come onto the market, but that consumers are nevertheless protected and are not left with any sort of financial problems if an airline were to actually go bankrupt or has to file for bankruptcy.
In this regard, I am pleased to hear you say that you are working on a solution.
The direction was, of course, clear in that there may also be an aid fund.
I am looking forward to the discussion in committee, which may perhaps even take place this year.
<D>
(RO) The situation in the Republic of Moldova is now clear.
We have a Communist party which is behaving in exactly the same way as the Soviet-style Communist parties which enslaved half of Europe in the 20th century.
We have an opposition inspired by democracy which is fighting for a Republic of Moldova attached to European values.
The resolution which we voted on today sends a powerful political signal to Chişinău, but this signal must be clearly backed up by specific actions from the Commission and the Council.
I therefore call on the European Commission to actively cooperate with the democratic opposition in Chişinău to find effective ways of strengthening democratic awareness in the Republic of Moldova.
The most effective way of doing this, in my view, is to lift the visa requirements for citizens from the Republic of Moldova within the Community.
I would like to clearly say to the Council that we must not be under any illusion.
The key to democratisation in the Republic of Moldova still lies in Moscow.
The European Union must take action to reduce this influence.
In fact, history shows us that these actions must be vigorous.
The citizens of Moldova are expecting from the European Union exactly what the citizens of Eastern Europe were expecting from the West before 1989.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, when do citizens need the solidarity of Europe?
When do Member States need the solidarity of the European Union?
Primarily, of course, in the event of disaster.
This is precisely the question that I asked in connection with the vote on the fourth cohesion report this spring.
Mr President, today we are discussing revising the Solidarity Fund to arm ourselves better for future challenges and to allow us to provide rapid and effective aid.
The Commission and Parliament are, according to their resolutions, of one mind concerning the objectives of this legislative initiative.
In July this year, I asked the Council about the status of this procedure.
It informed me that, unlike Parliament, it saw no need for an initiative at the current time.
In view of the fact that a former French Commissioner and minister stressed the need for revision in his report, I find the Council's attitude incomprehensible.
I therefore could not ask for a better committee chairman than Mr Galeote, who is not prepared to accept Parliament decisions being disregarded.
I would like to thank him quite specifically for that.
I would call on the French Presidency, as a matter of urgency, to reconsider their attitude towards the citizens of Europe.
<D>
(HU) Thank you, Mr President.
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen.
Regrettably, the restructuring of the sugar market has not brought the results we had hoped for.
In modifying the restructuring scheme, it must be taken into account that some Member States have renounced a substantial portion of their quota.
Hungary has abandoned 27% of its quota, whilst the average for the European Union as a whole is just 10.5%.
When determining the final quota reductions, therefore, I am in favour of taking into account the scale of production in each Member State.
It would be inappropriate if the same reduction was prescribed for all Member States of the European Union at the same time since production characteristics differ in each country.
Moreover, modification of the restructuring scheme should not impact negatively on Member States that have already implemented a higher-than-average quota reduction.
For this reason I oppose taking beet and isoglucose quotas together when calculating the ratio of the quota renounced to the initial quota.
Meanwhile, the maximum amount of restructuring aid should also be granted in instances where facilities are not dismantled but converted to alternative uses such as biomass or bioethanol production.
Thank you for your attention.
<D>
(PL) Mr President, the protection of water resources, water ecosystems and drinking water is one of the essentials of environmental protection.
Coordinated action is therefore required at EU level to ensure effective protection of this valuable resource.
The three main challenges facing Europe in the sphere of water consumption are thrifty, sustainable and effective consumption.
Climate change is not the only challenge facing Europe.
Despite increasing demand for water, we are still grappling with excessive, unsustainable and inefficient water consumption that is rising almost twice as fast as the world's population.
In Europe itself, at least 20% of resources are wasted because of inefficient management.
Means of regulating demand are therefore to be preferred to the usual increase in supply.
Means of regulating supplies should be considered only when the potential linked to more thrifty water management, better control of demand and educational actions has been exhausted.
Regional cooperation and the use of structural funds may also play a not insignificant role.
<D>
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, last week I had the opportunity, with the delegation, to spend time not only in Tbilisi, but also in Abkhazia and the occupied part of the district of Gali.
Two things touched me particularly: firstly, the fate of the people there who were forced to flee, only some of whom have been able to return to cultivate their fields, and who of course have difficulty selling their produce over a border that has suddenly been drawn through their country.
What also concerned me was the representative of the de facto government we spoke to, who was obviously rather incompetent.
Commissioner, I fear that, as a result - you mentioned this specifically - Russia will give the people of Abkhazia very little opportunity or possibility to enter into a peace plan.
Our sympathies therefore naturally lie with Georgia, a small country being put under pressure by a very large neighbour.
However, I believe that both sides must exercise restraint, especially at present, and I therefore support the statements by the Council and the Commission.
Another reason I do so is because I found what the Deputy Prime Minister of Georgia told our committee yesterday, and the way in which he said it, rather unsatisfactory, as it smacked of warmongering talk that ought to be avoided at this critical stage.
The elections are imminent and some things, including in the direction of the elections, are naturally being exploited.
Russia is falling into exactly this trap and even indirectly and unwittingly supporting those forces in Georgia that might want to use the conflict for their own political ends.
Let me repeat: we fully support Georgia and its aspirations for independence and integrity - there is no room for discussion on that point.
We hope, too, that the upcoming elections really will be conducted freely and fairly.
Two things, in particular, are pushing Georgia towards the European Union and this is important too, in my view.
The first is the relaxation of visa restrictions.
It is unacceptable that Russians - and, indirectly, Abkhazian and Georgian citizens issued with Russian passports - have visa freedoms that Georgians themselves do not.
That is unfair and unjust, and it must be rectified.
Secondly, a truly multilateral peace-keeping mission needs to be set up in Georgia.
We cannot allow a peace group to be active there that is made up, on the one hand, of Russia, one party to the conflict, and on the other hand, of the major party that has virtually occupied the area and is now also providing the peacekeeping force.
I believe that Georgia's desire to prevent this is justified and it is crucial - the Commissioner has already said as much to the committee - that we maintain the ability to keep negotiating.
Naturally, we cannot admit one hundred per cent of the details and the wordings that Georgia comes up with - we are the European Union - but these two demands from Georgia deserve particular support.
I hope that the Commission will be active and will indeed be successful in supporting Georgia's concerns here.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, Mr President of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, unlike the speakers from the Socialist Group I wish to commend the Commission for not having hastily altered its economic policy guidelines in these times of global uncertainty caused by the financial crisis.
This process forms an integral part of the post-Lisbon Strategy.
I wish to explicitly commend the Commission, because it is right.
The shortcomings in fact lie in implementation by the Member States, and the President of the Council should concentrate on these shortcomings in the Member States and not on what changes the Commission can make.
That is the problem.
When Mr Bullmann talks about a 'policy-blocking cartel', his criticism is completely unjustified.
Secondly, the opportunities of globalisation should be exploited and the risks minimised.
Mr Schulz said that poverty has increased.
That is just an illusion!
Europe is a model of prosperity!
Prosperity in Europe has risen; its distribution has changed.
History has taught us, however, what becomes of societies where there are no differences in distribution.
There has to be a certain difference in distribution to stimulate modernisation and dynamism.
That is surely undeniable.
Thirdly, on the subject of cutting red tape, not enough has happened in that respect.
We have a High Level Group, but nothing is heard of it any more.
Is it still functioning?
What are its interim findings?
When can we expect any?
We should like to know before the European elections.
My final point relates to finance market stability.
It is indeed true that the greed in the finance market is greater than the fear of disruption, and the Commission needs to take action in this regard.
It has already announced some plans.
On the subject of climate change, here, too, the Commission's primary duty is to persuade the Member States at the summit to abide by their earlier goals.
Certain Member States have in fact emitted far more CO2 than was ever authorised.
How can we effectively introduce new measures unless the sinners of today and past years are punished?
<D>
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, there can be no doubt that Pakistan is a very important issue.
It is too important, however, to deal with it as an item in Thursday afternoon's debate on breaches of human rights.
Discussing Pakistan is clearly not just a matter of examining human-rights violations but a real opportunity to debate aspects of EU foreign policy in that entire region.
I believe we would do better to put Pakistan on our next agenda as a proper debate with the Council and the Commission, because that, in my view, is what we need most.
The subject of Uzbekistan is of more immediate concern, because the Council intends to lift certain sanctions today.
In the present situation, I believe we should adopt the position that what is happening in Uzbekistan is a human-rights issue which dictates that sanctions should not be lifted.
That can be quickly decided on Thursday afternoon.
Pakistan is a very difficult and crucial foreign-policy issue and should be placed on our next agenda.
(Parliament adopted the motion.)
(The order of business was thus adopted.)
<D>
Mr President, I do think there is a misconception when we talk about active dialogue with citizens on Europe, because we often confuse dialogue with citizens with dialogue with civil society.
We often confuse dialogue with citizens with dialogue with organisations either wholly or partly funded by the Commission.
In effect, we have EU institutions talking to organisations funded by the Commission, which, in the end, means by taxpayers' money.
So, when we actually give citizens the right to have their say - as we did on the Constitution in France and the Netherlands and on the Lisbon Treaty in Ireland - and they say 'no', what do we do?
We completely ignore the result of the vote!
When the people have said 'no', dialogue does not mean making them vote again and again and again until you get the result you want.
That is not dialogue.
That is an abdication of democracy.
It is time that we genuinely engaged in active dialogue with citizens.
<D>
Mr President, the ALDE Group welcomes the proposal for a regulation but shares the general feeling of regret that we have not had time to submit fully considered amendments to it.
It is good, therefore, to hear that the Commission will take full note of the concerns expressed both in committee this morning and in the course of tonight's debate and that it will negotiate with the Council to make such adjustments as are appropriate.
Two such concerns relate to partial decommissioning, both in terms of whether it will detract too much from the targets for capacity reduction and about the uses to which any subsidies might be put.
It would be helpful to gain some reassurances from the Commission in these regards.
As to the two amendments, the first, we think, is effectively already covered by the text.
We sympathise a great deal with the second, as we believe it is intended to address the concerns just mentioned, but we feel that it might actually prove counter-productive to capacity reduction.
So, rather than vote in haste to promote its inclusion in a legislative text, we ask the Commission to consider the merits of the idea, and also that of developing other measures that place emphasis on the reduction of fuel consumption.
Finally, and on a more personal note, I would point to two sentences in the Commission communication.
These read: 'It is essential that this package is applied in a way that safeguards a level playing field across the Union.
There should be no distortion of competition among EU fishermen resulting from the different ability of Member States to mobilise public or Community funding.'
I would endorse the point that has already been made that there should equally be no distortion of competition resulting from the different willingness of Member States to mobilise such funding.
I trust that all possible steps will be taken to ensure that each and every one of them with a fishing fleet takes advantage of the opportunities that the regulation offers.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, Mr Leinen, I am a veteran of these topical and urgent debates.
They used to be held on Fridays, then they moved to Thursday afternoons.
All the groups regularly used to try the trick of making a request like this if there was some urgent matter that did not suit them, like the topic of Kashmir in this case.
That is why the Rules of Procedure were amended and the stipulation introduced that 40 Members - it may not be formulated very clearly, but that was the intention of the reform - have to be in the Chamber and contest the quorum.
It was introduced because we were aware of the problem and, since then, there has never been the required number of Members present in the Chamber to request that the quorum be established, so it was always deemed to exist.
I think it is important legally to consider the intention of this rule.
I am sure it can be looked up in the committee and plenary Minutes.
The intention of the reform was to link the question of the quorum with a number of Members present that was high enough to prevent it becoming a frequent parlour game, for that would almost have ruined these debates.
It was with the purpose of saving them that we introduced this quorum of 40 back then.
However, if we now make that 40 signatures, then the reform no longer makes sense.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I am happy to contribute by answering on the issue of the specificity of sport.
It would be very timely to discuss this even in more depth - not now, but later on - because on 11 July this year the Commission adopted a White Paper on sport.
This was a very important contribution, which stressed the importance of promoting the training of young, talented sportsmen and sportswomen in proper conditions, which is crucial for the sustainable development of sport at all levels.
This was an institutional and very political contribution to the question and to cooperation on this matter.
I quote from the paper: 'Rules requiring that teams include a certain quota of locally trained players could be accepted as being compatible with the Treaty provisions on free movement of persons if they do not lead to any direct discrimination based on nationality and if possible indirect discrimination effects resulting from them can be justified as being proportionate to a legitimate objective pursued, such as to enhance and protect the training and development of talented young players.'
I think this is a very important clarification of how to understand this issue.
The Commission is currently in the process of evaluating the compatibility of UEFA's measures on home-grown players with Community law, with a view to striking the right balance between the need to comply, on the one side, with Community law and the autonomy of sports organisations, and with the interests of European football on the other.
This is done in the light of the declaration annexed to the Amsterdam Treaty, the so-called Nice Declaration of the European Council in 2000, and the White Paper on Sport, which specifically mentions, as action number 9 in the Pierre de Coubertin Action Plan, 'to complete the analysis of rules requiring that teams include a certain quota of locally training players'.
This comprehensive comparative information on football academies in Member States and on home-grown players is not available at present.
In 2006, the Commission launched a study on sport academies in Member States, including the issue of home-grown players.
The results of this study are expected to provide valuable input for its analysis.
Concerning the second part of the question - because it consists of two sentences on the specificity of sport - Chapter 4 of this White Paper develops the concept of specificity of sport within the limits of existing EU competences.
As described in more detail in our Staff Working Document in the annexes, decisions taken by the European Court of Justice and the Commission show that the specificity of sport has been recognised and taken into account in the past.
The Commission shares the view that certain values and traditions of European sport should be promoted and will continue to recognise the specificities of this sector, while respecting EU law.
However, a case-by-case approach remains the basis for the Commission's control of the application of EU law, and in particular competition and internal market rules.
This is in line with the current Treaty provisions.
In order to provide legal clarity for all stakeholders and to contribute to the improvement of governance in European sport, the above-mentioned Staff Working Document and its two annexes explain in depth this issue of specificity.
It concerns sport and EU competition rules and sport and internal market freedoms, and takes stock for the first time of European Court of Justice case-law and Commission decisions in the area of sport.
I want to underline that, for the first time, the specificity of sport is set out in our policy document much more than it has been at any time in the recent past in the EU context.
That is one of the most important contributions - not only to this answer, but also to the promotion of sport in the European Union.
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (NL) Madam President, I have asked to speak because I am concerned.
We are talking about the European Schools today, and I am grateful to Mrs Hennicot for that.
I should like to draw the attention of Commissioner Kallas to a specific aspect of the European Schools, namely religious education.
During the course of last year a number of worrying reports reached me.
As you all know, the Board of Governors of the European Schools ruled last year that a minimum of seven pupils of the same language was needed in order for a subject to be taught in the mother tongue.
For general subjects such as geography and maths this is not a problem, but it is very different when it comes to religious education.
This raising of the minimum number means that there are now European Schools where pupils are no longer able to receive religious education in their own language.
I am most concerned by this, especially at primary level.
I think that religion, talking and learning about the standards and values we all prize so greatly in Europe, is extremely important.
In religion, feelings are very important and as we all know, children are best able to express feelings and emotions in their mother tongue.
I find it unacceptable that, depending on their language and nationality, some pupils can and others cannot receive religious education in their own language.
So I ask the Commissioner to give thought to this and to set clear guidelines.
All pupils, whether their mother tongue is English, German or Dutch, must have the same opportunities and the same quality of instruction.
Consideration should be given not only to the pupils but also to the position of teaching staff.
The 'minimum of seven' rule means that every year the question arises of whether there are enough pupils, and teaching staff are not sure whether religious education will be provided in the following school year.
This professional uncertainty has consequences when it comes to finding good teachers of religious education in all languages.
I urge the Commission to emphasise the importance of religious education for European School parents and pupils and to hold out for the continuation of religious education in pupils' mother tongue at the European Schools.
<D>
I support this proposal, which aims to improve the operation of the European Judicial Network in civil and commercial matters.
I am pleased that an agreement has been reached at first reading.
I have always supported the introduction of closer links between judges and the institutional machinery of European judicial cooperation, in order to allow these professionals to follow each stage of the construction of a judicial Europe, thereby helping to consolidate the area of freedom, security and justice and build a European judicial culture.
This network consists of contact points (judges) who cooperate with each other to tackle the difficulties that may arise in judicial cooperation between Member States.
It covers all areas, in other words both civil and commercial matters.
I believe that the network should be open to allow participation by professional associations, at the same time as endeavouring to reinforce the information provided to the general public.
These improvements will bring clear benefits for the mutual recognition of judgments, which essentially forms the cornerstone of judicial cooperation.
<D>
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I have been working as a doctor fighting AIDS for 21 years and every year I still hear the same debates.
From a clinical viewpoint, the situation is very clear: we have about 30 anti-retroviral drugs that are able to prolong the lives of those with the HIV virus.
We do not have any drug that is able to destroy the virus and, as a result, in the West and in Europe, we have seen a decrease in mortality and an increase in the number of people living with the HIV virus, who can technically be described as 'potential vectors of infection'.
This means that today, we have a greater risk of coming into contact with people with the HIV virus than in the past, because the number of HIV-positive survivors is increasing.
In the midst of all this, what is being done?
Nothing.
The majority of European countries have not had any stable prevention campaigns for years.
Prophylactics cost a lot and let us give the words a precise, recognisable name: prophylactics cost a lot and are one of the main ways of preventing the HIV virus.
That is without mentioning damage-reduction projects aimed particularly at drug addicts to prevent the sharing of needles.
How many countries carry out projects of this kind nationally?
In Italy, 50% of confirmed AIDS diagnoses come at the same time as diagnoses of the HIV virus, which means that many people do not know they have HIV until they are ill.
Where are the campaigns for increasing access to tests, which should be free and anonymous?
We know that if there is discrimination, people will try to hide, they will not go to have the test, and this will entail risks for their own health and the health of others.
One last point: today, again, the Council has spoken of aid to the global South, but I would like to know what happened to the proposals made by Parliament when we voted for the most recent version of TRIPS, which committed the Commission and the Council to increase funds for combating AIDS in the global South and, in particular, to transfer technologies and to transfer pharmacological aid.
<D>
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you, Mr Verheugen, for coming and giving us the opportunity to discuss this document together.
With regard to the proposal to amend the directive concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market, Parliament has agreed on the need to grant certain extensions to the review period required to correctly assess the main active substances of certain biocidal products, in view of the specific nature of the necessary tests and market requirements.
However, you should be aware that we are awaiting the more thorough revision of Directive 98/8/EC on biocidal products to express our views regarding the content.
I would therefore like to suggest some ideas for the Commission to think about.
First and foremost, it would be beneficial to make the transition from a directive to a regulation, a legislative instrument that would enable the same provisions to enter into force simultaneously in all Member States, thus regulating the sector uniformly.
One key point will be the sharing of data, in accordance with EU guidelines, and, as already implemented with REACH, testing on vertebrates should be avoided or significantly reduced for biocidal products also, thanks to the mandatory sharing of data obtained through such tests among those who register the same active substance, thereby avoiding any duplication of studies.
Data sharing would allow for greater efficiency in the file evaluation system and would cut the cost of drafting these files, which would be significant both for small- and medium-sized enterprises and the national authorities responsible for examining applications.
Emphasis must be placed on simplifying procedures and applying mutual recognition of authorisation for a given product and its use among the different Member States, in order to speed up both procedures and the placing of the biocidal product on the market in the aforesaid States.
Following this, the scale of charges and common time periods for examining applications in the different countries should be harmonised, and the authorisation process should be simplified in the case of formulations with minimal differences or variations in colour, for example, thus avoiding extra specific tests requiring further evaluation by each Member State.
Lastly, we must avoid discrimination between European producers of goods treated with biocidal products and extra-Community goods containing such products.
I leave it up to the Commission to come up with a solution that the new Parliament, we hope, will be able to support.
<D>
Mr President, as you are aware, there will be a referendum in Ireland on 12 June on the Lisbon Treaty.
I want to raise with you a matter of very deep concern in Ireland.
It has emerged through the media that the Commission, and committees of this Parliament, are actively colluding to suppress information.
Let me quote Commission Vice-President Margot Wallström, that the Commission is willing to tone down or delay messages that might be unhelpful in advance of the referendum on the Lisbon Treaty; reports have been carried in the press of a letter that was sent to parliamentary committees urging them not to deal with sensitive political issues that might arise from Lisbon until the Treaty has been ratified.
I want to say to you that these types of tactics are unacceptable.
The Irish people should have their debate with full information.
They deserve the full and unvarnished facts, whether in relation to corporation tax or the outworkings of the defence and security provisions of the Treaty.
As a minimum - I am sure you will agree - the people deserve the full facts.
So I call on you today to clarify publicly that committees will not delay or suppress debate on these sensitive matters, and I would equally urge the Commission to do likewise.
<D>
(SL) Mr President, the problems of environmental protection and increased energy needs in connection with climate change are a challenge requiring a conscientious approach by all politicians.
They transcend state borders and national interests.
The construction of marine gas terminals in enclosed seas, such as the Adriatic, is even more sensitive.
Terrestrial and marine gas terminals have been planned for the bay of Trieste with an intended location only five miles from the Slovenian coast, right opposite the largest tourist region of Piran.
If the Italian Government dared, it could locate it in the Venetian Laguna as well, but this would not succeed because the whole of the civilised world would object to it.
Citizens have the right to object to such a construction, and politicians must respect their wishes and make up for the democratic deficit in the European Union.
We have neglected the environment too often to allow ourselves to do such a thing again.
The Italian Government should be given a clear message about it from the European Parliament.
<D>
(SK) I am very pleased that we are able to discuss the revised framework agreement on relations between the European Parliament and the European Commission at today's meeting.
This revision corroborates and gives tangible form to the stronger position of the European Parliament after the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon.
Today, I would personally like to highlight the agreement concluded between the Commission and the working party of the European Parliament on the framework agreement, and thank you, Mr Vice-President, for your personal involvement.
Allow me to make a few comments with regard to the framework agreement.
The stronger position of the European Parliament makes for a more democratic European Union.
As the elected representatives of the citizens of the Member States, we will participate in the adoption of European legislation and will have greater control over the Commission.
The Commission will, for example, be obliged to submit reports to us on the concrete follow-up provisions adopted for any legislative initiative request.
The Commission will be equally obliged to ask us for approval in the event that it intends to change the Code of conduct for Commissioners.
We also definitely welcome the fact that on the basis of the treaty, the European Parliament will be better and more transparently informed about the conclusion of international agreements.
The aforementioned provisions are not the only ones; the revised framework agreement contains many more similar provisions and I firmly believe that they will all lead towards more effective and closer cooperation between both institutions, and that they will represent a coherent implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon.
In conclusion, I would like to highlight a key area: the timely cooperation of Parliament on requests ensuing from the European citizens' initiative is a significant provision which, pursuant to the agreement, will guarantee close contact between the European Parliament and citizens.

(FR) Mr President, at a time when the crossing points into the Gaza Strip are closed and are controlled by the Israeli army, at a time when murderous incursions are being conducted there on a daily basis, at a time when the number of settlers in the occupied territories is continuing to grow, at a time when, in violation of international law, the construction of the wall and security surveillance are continuing, within these very walls, in the European Parliament, there are still people who would deny Israel's status as an occupying power.
It is shocking!
Israel is an occupying power, and as such has obligations under the Geneva Conventions and, in particular, must not use collective punishment under any circumstances.
We would be well advised to ensure that Israel meets its obligations instead of sending disastrous signals, as we did for example by suspending funding for the fuel supply for the power station in Gaza.
The crocodile tears we have shed over the divisions between Palestinians are really inappropriate after the European Union was incapable of supporting Mahmoud Abbas' efforts to co-opt the pragmatic wing of Hamas.
Can you imagine anything worse?
Playing Ramallah off against Gaza?
Deciding who are the good Palestinians and helping them to get rid of the bad?
Who can believe in a lasting solution if the political and territorial unity of Palestine is not guaranteed?
Who can believe that peace for the Israelis and Palestinians will be built through a policy that in fact leads to the radicalisation of the people of Israel and of Palestine?
The humanitarian situation in Gaza breaches all the standards of human dignity.
The lifting of the blockade of the Gaza Strip needs to be secured as quickly as possible.
Due pressure needs to be exerted on Israel.
This question cannot remain a taboo anymore and I am asking you, the Council and the Commission, what measures you intend to take in order to encourage the lifting of the blockade and to force Israel to comply with its obligations and commitments.
I am asking you what you intend to do to make Israel give up its plans to cut the West Bank in two by linking Jericho with East Jerusalem, a month before the international conference.
(Applause)

The 18th round of Ukraine-EU negotiations on the signing of the association agreement is taking place this week in Brussels.
The process has taken too long.
It is time to sign the agreement, because it is in the interests of both the EU and Ukraine.
With a population of 46 million, Ukraine needs stability in the region.
In recent years, Ukraine has turned into a political football pitch: it must not be forced to choose between Russia and the West.
It is important for EU Member States, in particular, Lithuania, to actively seek closer cooperation with their Eastern neighbours, even if some differences remain.
The conclusion of a successful association agreement would encourage modernisation and reforms in Ukraine and help it to come closer to EU standards.
As for negotiations on the free trade area, we must seek agreements on tariff proposals, energy taxation procedures and sustainable development.
Liberalising the movement of people is also crucial.
Lithuanians still remember the travel restrictions they experienced.
We know what it means to live on Europe's external border.
It is important for the issue of visa-free travel to be the number one priority.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, we would all certainly go along with this.
Mr Cohn-Bendit has stated precisely what we are all thinking.
However, in this House there are rules of procedure, not just because we want to torment people, but because large groups with way over 200 members also have problems, which you have perhaps to a lesser extent, Mr Cohn-Bendit, in your smaller group, namely that we have to be able to consult one another.
When I add the members of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and those of my group together, there are way over 450 Members in this House who need a little time for consultation.
I would therefore make the following proposal: what Mr Cohn-Bendit has said here, that we convey to the Russian side that we consider this law unfair and that it should be retracted, the Commission and the Council can pick up from here on.
This is certainly a statement of the will of the entire European Parliament, which has already been made clear through this discussion.
A resolution, however, that contains 60-70 items also has to be able to be discussed a little and only by doing so will it work.
We therefore ask for the debate, the draft resolution, and then the vote at the next sitting.
This is in actual fact a fair compromise.
Please endorse it!
<D>
Since 2006, the EU has been China's leading trading partner, and since 2007, China has been Europe's second largest trading partner.
China currently accounts for 6% of world trade.
The PRC has made great strides since the report that I had the honour of presenting in this House in 2002.
It appears, however, that many of the aspects that needed to be remedied at the time still persist, even though, in some respects, they have been resolved by remarkable advances.
In terms of social and environmental impact, there is a clear lack of preparation by Chinese industry, and this requires greater European incentive.
China and the EU have been negotiating a Partnership and Cooperation Agreement since October 2007, with results that have yet to be seen.
In view of European support for many aspects of international trade, China should not breach commitments undertaken within the WTO.
Obstacles have been introduced in the form of rules and regulations, which restrict access by European companies in strategic sectors.
In November, the PRC declared its intention to abandon the system in place since 2007 of dual control of textile and footwear imports.
The available statistics do not facilitate a discussion, but we may be facing a trade controversy.
<D>
(PL) Madam President, the question of the battle against this disease was raised - and credit should be given for this - during the French Presidency.
It was said then that the EU should take action in this matter.
It would be good if the next Presidency took up this matter and treated it with equal importance.
It has already been said here that this problem affects millions of people and their families, who are all suffering.
When we meet our constituents, we often hear this question: what does the EU do for the citizens of Europe?
What are you there for?
What are you responsible for?
What do you do?
It is just this type of question which should be the subject of efforts to build an image of authority and importance for the European Union.
This is what our citizens need.
Joint efforts to combat diseases of this kind must be a priority for the EU institutions.
<D>
- (SL) The New Transatlantic Agenda was new in 1995.
Many things have changed in the years since, which is why we need a new partnership agreement.
Twenty years have passed since the collapse of the Berlin Wall and that event was followed by the historic enlargement of the European Union.
During that period we have borne witness to the tragic upsurge in terrorism and to the new threats to peace in the region.
Furthermore, we have grown aware of climate change and have faced financial, economic and energy crises.
It would be useful if we took stock after the collapse of Communism and viewed the condition of the world with greater sensitivity to the interdependence of global actors.
Our closer partnership with the USA should be developed in the context of new challenges and new insights.
We are not dealing with a financial or economic crisis alone.
We are also dealing with a global leadership crisis.
We need to advance on a number of fronts simultaneously.
We will fail to reform the international financial system unless there is progress in the Doha process and unless we are more successful in working towards peace and eliminating poverty.
If we are talking about efficient multilateralism, it needs to be developed in ways that ensure everyone is a winner.
'Yes, we can'.
In that spirit, I am in favour of regular political consultations between the two partners and, in particular, of strengthening the parliamentary dimension of cooperation by establishing a Transatlantic Assembly.
As far as the report is concerned, I am particularly pleased by the emphasis placed on eliminating restrictions on investment and transatlantic financial services.
In conclusion, I also welcome the will expressed in the report for closer cooperation as regards space programmes, particularly between the European Space Agency and NASA.
This is not to say that I wish to become an astronaut but, rather, that I am interested in new technologies.
<D>
(IT) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, I should like to explain why we are tabling this motion for a resolution on the shipwrecks in the Kerch Strait in the Black Sea.
Our solidarity goes to the victims of that disaster!
We invite the Council and the Commission carefully to monitor the situation in the Black Sea and to take concrete measures to help to reduce the ecological impact of the disaster.
Europe does not yet have the panoply of regulations needed to prevent any repetition of very serious accidents along the lines of the Black Sea accident; among other things, those regulations must make states responsible for the safety of the vessels flying their flags and for prosecuting, including through civil proceedings, those responsible for such environmental disasters.
Although the European Parliament adopted the third maritime safety package at first reading in April 2007, it has not yet been fully approved by and is inexplicably blocked in the Council, despite the commitment that the Portuguese Presidency gave in this respect to the Transport Committee and Parliament.
The package, consisting of seven reports, is a comprehensive package: it steps up maritime safety standards, safeguards passengers, limits environmental damage in the event of accidents, and sets out obligations and responsibilities on the part of states, carriers and ship-owners.
Breaking up the debate and giving priority to some aspects and not others is proof that the Council does not want to tackle the issue of safety in a serious way and wants to put a brake on the package as a whole.
Maritime safety is too important an issue to be the subject of tactics, too serious because of the events that have already taken place: Erika, Prestige, more recently Segesta Jet in the Strait of Messina and Sea Diamond in Santorini!
Because of the accidents that have already happened and because increasing maritime traffic in Europe and the world could well increase the risks in future.
It is for that reason that the European Parliament considers that all seven of the proposals must be taken forward as soon as possible, before there is another environmental disaster with human losses: to harmonise types of classification, to compel states to monitor vessels flying their flags, to ensure that vessels are inspected in ports and to monitor their movements, to decide what action should be taken in the event of accidents and to monitor and manage responsibilities as regards both third parties and passengers.
We therefore urge the Council not to turn a blind eye to this tragic warning from the Black Sea.
<D>
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FR) Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, during our next sitting we will again approve the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Before we do this, let me ask a question which is perhaps not as simple as it appears.
Will this be the initial Charter proclaimed in the year 2000 or, as the Leinen report suggests, will it be the adapted rehash integrated within the former draft Constitutional Treaty?
The two texts are not, of course, identical and I feel it is unfortunate that their differences are not clearly set out, although that would have raised some legitimate controversy.
For example, the French human rights commission expressed, and I quote, its grave concern about the amendments made to the articles on social rights - I am still quoting - that threaten to remove the social content of the Charter.
One of the main authors of the original Charter, the lawyer Guy Braibant, explained in the press - and I quote - that the conditions for applying the text have changed.
First of all, the word 'may' is occasionally replaced by 'must'.
Moreover - and I am still quoting - there is an official reference to 'explanations' by the Presidium.
Although they ought to be pedagogical and completely neutral, the explanations interpret laws in a rather minimal sense.
Fundamental rights have been undermined, unquote.
Which text will we be approving in the next sitting?
I also have a subsidiary question: will this approval be valid in all EU countries?
This kind of action cannot entertain any ambiguity.
Thus I would appreciate a precise reply to these two questions.
<D>
(PL) Mr President, I would like to support the statements made by previous speakers.
In addition, however, I should like to mention another very important issue, namely that we cannot deal with policy on Belarus in isolation from the European Union's eastern policy as a whole.
We had a tendency to forgive the Russian administration a great many undemocratic actions.
That should be borne in mind.
I know that events in Belarus do not bear comparison with what is currently taking place in Russia, but they most certainly did and do bear comparison with what took place in Chechnya.
We cannot adopt one course of action for Belarus and a different one for Russia.
Conducting our eastern policy from the point of view of enlargement of the European Union is another very important issue.
The fate of Ukraine currently hangs in the balance, and if it swings towards democracy it will enrich the whole of Europe.
If we are prepared to open the door to the people of Ukraine, it will send a signal to the people of Belarus and show them that there is another option, one involving closer links and relationships with the European Union.
In the future it may also involve membership of the Union, although that may not come about for many years.
<D>
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (NL) Thank you, Mr Søndergaard, your report is a gem, covering, as it does, all the pertinent points.
I should, however, like to ask the President and this Parliament's Bureau to take note of the Council's absence and not to leave it at that.
We should not let them run rings around us.
I should like to urge the Bureau to consider sending the Council a very firm letter of protest with the message that this is unacceptable.
Indeed, as things stand at the moment, we refuse to grant an extension.
This is beyond question now.
We cannot grant discharge to the Council.
This is not so much about fraud, as it is about a matter of principle, namely transparency.
EUR 650 million from the European budget is managed by Mr Solana in the area of defence, security and foreign policy, but without any form of monitoring.
This is not acceptable in a democracy.
It has to stop.
Hence the justified demands for an activities report, transparency and clarity.
That is not all, however.
As a rapporteur on VAT fraud, in my report that was approved on 4 December, I clearly asked the Council to answer a number of questions.
We are now four or five months down the line, and this period has been marked by a deafening silence from the Council, while the estimated fraud involved is between EUR 60 and 100 billion annually.
The Council must act.
Coordination is what is needed in the fight against VAT fraud, and as long as there is no willingness to act on their part, I will not grant discharge to the Council.
<D>
in writing. - (PL) Special thanks and congratulations are due not only to the rapporteur but also to Commissioner Kallas, who took the lead regarding new regulations for the principles of lobbying.
This is particularly important in view of the new competences to be acquired by the European Parliament pursuant to adoption of the Lisbon Treaty.
Nonetheless, I wish to express my concern as to the effectiveness and credibility of a voluntary register of lobbyists.
The register should be compulsory and common to all European institutions.
In view of its nature, Parliament should retain its autonomy, however.
Compulsory registration should apply to the whole range of lobbying bodies.
I have in mind, amongst others, regional representations, sectoral organisations, lawyers undertaking a lobbying role and research institutions.
All those who exercise influence in order to obtain economic or social benefits should be registered.
The requirement to submit only financial information is not always reliable and does not enable a full assessment to be undertaken as intended.
<D>
The main objective of the Europe 2020 strategy we are discussing should be to ensure economic growth in the European Union and to increase employment.
The measures we take should aim to increase economic activity and, in this way, to achieve sustained economic growth in the long term.
The indicators proposed by the Commission should be supplemented with an indicator of infrastructure saturation in the areas of teleinformatics, transport, energy, environment and social matters.
A well-developed infrastructure is the basis for the efficient functioning of the internal market which, consequently, leads to a growth in internal demand and economic activity.
In addition, a well-developed infrastructure is necessary to reduce differences in development between regions, leading to higher competitiveness and stronger economic, social and territorial cohesion.
Furthermore, I would like to refer to the employment indicator, which should be treated as a priority.
The steps we take should concentrate not only on structural reforms, but also on better preparation and use of the EU's workforce and intellectual capital.
I suppose none of us is in any doubt that, along with implementation of the EU 2020 strategy, we will need stronger leadership and greater political responsibility from Member States, and also the European Commission, in the area of undertaking structural reforms.
In this context, it would be helpful to make a thorough evaluation of the EU 2020 strategy around five years after its introduction, in other words, at the end of the mandate of the current European Commission.
This would allow political responsibility to be strengthened and actions to be correlated with results.
<D>
author. - (NL) Mr President, the violence in Somalia has everything to do with the fact that since 1991 there has no longer been a generally recognised government there.
In the south and centre of the country there has been fighting between the militias of various warlords for years and in the north the administration of the territory of the former British colony of Somaliland that is operating there is not recognised internationally.
Then a conflict broke out between the Union of Islamic Courts and the army of neighbouring Ethiopia.
Talks about reunification of the country never received general support and those who did support them often stopped.
The years of chaos soon turn support from the rest of the world for any transitional government into interference in insoluble armed domestic conflicts.
In the past few years I have warned a number of times that, by helping to finance failing structures, the European Union is being tied to one of the warring parties without any prospect of a lasting and widespread solution.
Europe certainly has to help if a solution is possible, but over-hasty interference leads to disaster.
In a previous urgent debate on Somalia on 15 November 2007, this Parliament adopted a resolution calling for an end to foreign military intervention and for dialogue and reconciliation within the country.
It is to be welcomed that the resolution that has now been tabled speaks out against European Union support for warlords who are trying to re-establish their power, against the use of child soldiers and against further arms supplies.
Yesterday there was an unsuccessful attempt to murder the Transitional President, Abdullahi Yusuf.
Armed troops are still in sharp conflict with each other.
We now have to see whether the agreement reached last week to end the violence within 30 days and to replace the Ethiopian intervention force with a United Nations peacekeeping force has a real chance of success.
If that leads to real solutions, it will make sense for Europe to support it.
<D>
(RO) I, too, wish to welcome the Commission's intention to support the Republic of Moldova.
The Republic of Moldova needs support that has to target the country's population.
This is the only way in which the Republic of Moldova's citizens will be able to acquire the confidence they need to find a path towards stability and growth.
The macrofinancial assistance package which was agreed on here must obviously be put together as urgently as possible.
Action must not be delayed because, if there is any delay, we will end up with disappointment in Moldova instead of confidence.
In addition to this, I believe that the government in Chişinău must be supported politically because, after a long period of time, the country is, at last, genuinely opening up to the European Union.
The name chosen by the government coalition is certainly no coincidence.
It is made up of parties who really want a different option to the one that has been chosen by Moldova until now.
This political support is vital, all the more so as there is a risk, and I strongly emphasise this point, that Moldova will be regarded as a local problem, at the very limit, a problem for the Romanians inside the European Union.
It is anything but this at all.
It is a European problem, and I am pleased that there are Members with a whole variety of perspectives speaking on this subject.
After all, Moldova is close to Europe and must be supported at a time when this opening is present there.
Otherwise, we risk falling back into a cycle of delays and procrastination, which was typical of the Voronin administration.
Democratic developments and support from the EU may actually also lead to a resolution of the situation in Transnistria because this region was in stalemate.
This was because the government in Chişinău was reluctant to end the stalemate and adopted an ambiguous, unconstructive position on this.
On a final note, Moldova's citizens require visas.
The situation there is by no means any worse than the situation in the Western Balkans, and citizens from the Republic of Moldova must therefore enjoy freedom of travel.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, we, the German conservative group (CDU/CSU), voted against Mrs Buitenweg's report.
We oppose discrimination of all kinds, but we do not believe that a comprehensive framework directive at European level is really the right way to protect those affected.
Ten Member States have still not transposed the existing anti-discrimination directive at all.
Despite that, a simple majority of this House - not a qualified majority - did vote in favour of this extension today.
It would give rise to considerable additional bureaucracy and unnecessary costs - something that the public has little understanding for.
Improvements can be made in relation to insurance and in the structural adaptation measures relating to disabled entrances, and the requirement for a law on class actions could be eliminated, but we foresee serious problems for the Member States if, for example, we were forced to include the concept 'belief' in the prohibited grounds for discrimination.
The consequence of this would be that extremists and sects, such as Scientology, for example, would be able to invoke the protection of the directive.
We are also opposed to granting complete equivalence of status to traditional and same-sex marriages.
In the Commission's view, the transposal of the directive requires that same-sex partners, insofar as they may be legally recognised in a given Member State, should also receive the same rights as married couples.
We are opposed to that idea.
We therefore voted against the report and in favour of referring the proposal back to the Commission.
<D>
rapporteur. - (FI) Mr President, first I wish to thank the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets and the Committee's members and coordinators for making it possible for us to reach an excellent compromise in a very positive atmosphere.
Parliament's Secretary-General was also very open and cooperative when the budget was being drafted.
It is a good start to future cooperation between the administration and the Committee on Budgets.
First of all I want to say that this system of two organisations deciding on the budget - the Bureau and the Committee on Budgets - cannot continue in the future.
It is not the right approach to have the Bureau developing various new ideas and new projects.
The Committee on Budgets is either a kind of rubber stamp approving the funds, or it is a bad boy or girl who cuts them out.
That was the case here too, when there were major new increases proposed by the group chairmen, which would have gone over the famous 20% ceiling which has been jointly agreed.
I do hope that people will listen to the Committee Chairman's guidelines on this, because he has the right idea about how this process should be gone about in the proper way, in order to achieve concrete and fitting results.
These matters cannot be decided in two places.
It is much better if they are decided in just one.
When Parliament's budget was being drawn up, the administration and the Bureau showed the right initiative in proposing that remaining under the 20% ceiling should be a basic principle.
Afterwards, the group chairmen made additions to the policy rules.
One was that each Member's assistants should receive a thousand euros more a month, making around EUR 10 000 000 in all, and there were various other increases, when in fact we had got into a situation where extra expenditure had to be cut to some extent.
This is obviously never easy, but it needs to be said that we have not made any real savings or cuts; instead, we just tried to adhere to budgetary discipline when it came to new increases, so that the budget would not grow too large.
This is obviously important because we are spending taxpayers' money.
We should think about what projects we should engage in and which of them are acceptable, from the taxpayer's point of view.
Above all, we need to concentrate on the essential work which we have been elected to do here.
This is a legislative body, and so we should not be implementing projects that lie outside the scope of actual legislative work.
Let me say, however, that I happy with the joint compromise allowing Parliament an increase of just under 4%.
That is reasonable, and in any case includes many projects which other Members here are in favour of.
I will mention some of these projects.
First, there is information policy, which is extremely important.
For this, an additional EUR nine million has been added to the reserve, to be spent on the new Web TV when the prototype has been approved.
This Web TV idea as a technical information channel is an acceptable notion, but it should not be put into effect in the way that is now being suggested.
The political groups and the Members are not to take part in monitoring the body concerned or in the everyday work involved.
The administration does not have the same sort of political honesty that people want to see as the political groups and the Members do.
I have found it very hard to appreciate the idea which has been proposed by the left that politics should be expunged from policy and that information on Parliament can come only via its administration, and not through its Members or political groups.
It is inconceivable to allow information policy to come only via the administration, and it leaves us, who have been elected to this place democratically, outside the information machinery.
Another idea connected with this subject was that concerning the local media, which was decided in plenary just before the holidays.
It was that Members should get a bit more money for inviting representatives of the local media to observe what is happening in Parliament and to interview them.
The Committee on Budgets voted against this.
I do not understand this apparent animosity towards the small local media coming from the left, as it allows us to get as close as we can to ordinary people.
Now we in the Committee on Budgets, however, have voted against this money by a majority, and we Members cannot spend any more money on inviting the local media here.
Thirdly, I would like to mention the Information Offices.
Each Member State has its own Information Office, which is a good thing, but why buy the most expensive buildings in the most expensive areas?
Why could we not buy slightly cheaper buildings a bit further out of town and spend the relevant funds on human resources?
We need more people to visit places of work, places of study and schools to tell people what Parliament does and why.
That is the best way to influence people, to go to them, and not buy costly buildings.
This money could be better spent.
As for the policy on buildings generally, I hope that all the institutions can together establish a common organisation to consider when and where to build and when and where to purchase property, so that we do not make decisions without knowing what others are doing and artificially raise property prices.
I just want to comment on the resolution on the proposal to reduce the number of sittings in Strasbourg.
This might be something of an eternal debate, but it has to go on until something gets done.
We also have to set an example in the reduction of emissions.
We cannot squander EUR 200 million of taxpayers' money a year.
We must show the public that the EU has enlarged and changed, and for this we have to change.
I have not come across one good explanation as to why this hassle has to continue.
For that reason, I hope that we will have a vote on the subject so that Parliament can negotiate with the Council and so that the much needed change can take place.
Once again I want to thank the coordinators and members of the Committee on Budgets for the compromise, and I hope that it will be preserved in the vote here on Thursday and that the figures concerned will remain just as we have jointly agreed.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - At this time of financial crisis and economic recession, both European governments and the European institutions need to show determination and flexibility, as mentioned by President Barroso in the preface to the recently adopted European economic recovery plan.
To show this flexibility, the Commission will, for instance, put in place a simplification package to speed up decision-making on state aid, allow for the use of accelerated procedures in public procurement in 2009 and 2010 for all major public projects, and request that Member States take corrective action in case of any excessive deficit in timeframes consistent with economic recovery to allow their economies to adjust.
However, this flexibility does not mean that the Commission has changed or will change the rules of the internal market.
A modernised approach to policies set out in the single market review of November 2007 needs to be pursued further as foreseen.
The 16 December 2008 progress report called 'The Single Market review: one year on' highlights a series of recently adopted measures that will help create the conditions to relaunch the European economy.
They include, most of all, stronger contractual rights to enhance consumer confidence, lower costs and administrative burdens, and a single company statute for SMEs.
It is also evident that we need to restructure the European regulatory and supervisory framework in order to minimise the risk of future crises.
Over the year, we have been working alongside Parliament and the Council to, among other things, increase protection for bank depositors, dissuade banks and other financial institutions from taking excessive risks in the future and better regulate the credit rating agencies.
The rapid adoption and implementation of these proposals is elementary.
We need to demonstrate that Europe can provide concrete answers.
Over the coming months, the Commission will formulate in a comprehensive manner how the current regulatory and supervisory framework should be further reformed to bring back stability and confidence.
We should strive for a more stable system that does a correspondingly better job in providing opportunities to trade, hedge, diversify and pool risk, allocate resources and mobilise savings.
This calls, among other things, for better cooperation and coordination between national regulators and supervisors, as well as avoiding any protectionism.
To foster longer economic growth we need to reduce the cost of capital and to enhance capital allocation.
It will clearly require a further strengthening of the internal market.
This flexibility certainly does not mean any changes to the single market principles.
On the contrary: at a time of financial economic downturn, both European governments and European institutions need to hold firmly to the principles of the single market.
It is essential that any measures to tackle the crisis are guided by the fundamental freedoms and the principles of non-discrimination and proportionality.
For instance, a framework for national rescue plans is already in place to prevent any negative spill-over effects amongst uncoordinated national actions.
A level playing field which has benefited Member States' consumers and businesses so much since 1992 needs to be maintained and safeguarded.
This is essential as any measure which would undermine the single market could further aggravate the impact of the financial crisis on the wider economy.
<D>
If you do not mind, I would rather not comment just now on articles in various publications, because I do not think we shall get anywhere by responding to articles like this.
What I would say is that cultural monuments, such as the Acropolis and other monuments in Greece and other Member States, are a source of inspiration and cross-cultural wealth and just today, the European Commission adopted a new system for labelling the major cultural monuments of the European Union, including the Acropolis.
I think that speaks for itself in terms of how Europe thinks about these monuments.
Subject: Strengthening and funding grassroots sporting organisations in the EU
Grassroots sporting organisations make a huge contribution to European society, culture and the health of European citizens; in the current economic climate, however, many grassroots sporting organisations are experiencing financial difficulties.
What action can the Commission take to strengthen grassroots sports and promote their development across the Member States?
The Commission has recently closed its public consultation on funding for grassroots sports.
Can the Commission give further information on the aims of this public consultation and when further information on the outcome of this consultation will be available?
<D>
(PL) Madam President, Monday's arrests in Copenhagen show that terrorism is still a real threat in Europe.
Europol's report reveals that it remained at a high level throughout last year.
Suffice it to say that last year 498 terrorist acts were recorded.
It is true that this threat is not evenly distributed, with as many as 294 instances taking place in France and 145 in Spain, but at a time of globalisation, the whole territory of the European Union is of interest to terrorists.
Moreover, this is not altered by the fact that a significant majority of these acts are separatist in nature (something Europe has spent decades getting used to), such as Basque or Corsican terrorism, or the left-wing anarchy in Greece.
Does this process of getting used to terrorism mean that we in Europe are well prepared to fight it?
My conviction is that that the answer is still no.
Implementation of the basic conceptual documents, even something as fundamental as the counter-terrorism strategy, or the legislative instruments in the shape of the framework decision of June 2002, leaves much to be desired.
Coordination of prevention and reaction to acts of terrorism is also unsatisfactory.
In this regard there is an urgent need to upgrade such cooperation, especially operational cooperation and the exchange of information between Member States; we need to enhance the capacities of Europol and Eurojust; we need - and this is something we keep calling for - to strengthen the protection of critical infrastructure, especially for transport and energy.
We must also insist that the solidarity clause that was written into the earlier draft of the Constitutional Treaty is included in the new treaty and that a suitable anti-terrorism clause is incorporated into agreements with third countries; my report was calling for this before the holidays.

on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (EL) Mr President, Commissioner, fellow Members, every year 370 000 people in Europe die prematurely from illnesses associated with air pollution.
According to the Commission's official figures, life expectancy in some European countries has shown a decline of between eight months and two years as a result of exposure to dangerous airborne pollutants.
The great majority of deaths are due to fine airborne particulates.
My political group supports the final conciliation agreement and the hesitant, but at any rate positive steps which it takes in response to this situation.
However, I would like to focus on some serious weaknesses: the limits set by this conciliation for fine airborne particulates are more than double the relevant WHO recommendations.
The US Environmental Protection Agency sets stricter limits than the European Union.
No agreement has been reached on safer limits for fine airborne particulates (PM10).
Monitoring requirements have been reduced, although constant monitoring of critical pollutant loads is very important for improving the situation.
The compliance deadlines for benzene have been put back, leaving the big culprit, fuel quality, untouched.
Although everyone says we need improved fuels and cleaner cars, air quality and its monitoring in the workplace have been exempted.
Furthermore, the Member States are given considerable leeway not to enforce the existing legislation and not to monitor its correct enforcement.
We are making a positive step, then, but it is not enough, and for exactly this reason my political group is supporting the European Parliament's conciliation agreement but at the same time asking the Council and Commission to take bolder steps.
<D>
The adopted amendments somewhat improve the Council's proposal.
The justification for this Directive derives from a requirement contained in the Directive establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy, and contains aspects with which we disagree.
Such is the case with the polluter pays principle, which may just serve to protect those who have the money to pay for pollution.
All they will need to do is pay up and then create clean-up industries to be able to carry on with their lucrative business at the cost of pollution that they have, meanwhile, been authorised to create, possibly destroying rivers, forests, etc.
We believe it is essential to act in the area of pollution prevention.
Yet we know that Article 16 of the Framework Directive, lists various obligations relating to the Commission's drawing-up of proposals, including specific measures to combat water pollution by individual pollutants or groups of pollutants that pose a significant risk to or via the aquatic environment, establishing a list of priority substances, including priority hazardous substances and also setting quality standards applicable to the concentrations of priority substances in surface water, sediment and biota.
We also know that the Council has failed to meet the expectations of the European Parliament as regards the reclassification of certain priority substances as priority hazardous substances and as regards other important areas.
Hence our abstention.
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, our resolution deals with the human-rights situation in Iran and the dispute over the Iranian nuclear programme.
On the subject of human rights, this House has clearly expressed its views time and again over the years.
The High Representative spoke once more today of executions and torture.
In the light of recent events, I should like to mention the names of political activists belonging to the Ahwazi Arab community who have been condemned to death, and to call on the Iranian Government not to execute them.
Their names are Zamal Bawi, Faleh al-Mansouri, Said Saki and Rasoul Mazrea; the same applies to two Kurdish journalists, Abdolwahed 'Hiwa' Butimar and Adnan Hassanpour.
May this publicising of their plight in Europe afford them protection!
As far as the nuclear issue is concerned, Saeed Jalili, the chief Iranian negotiator, did not provide the Committee on Foreign Affairs last week with a clear indication of Iran's real intentions.
Questions from 24 committee members were dealt with en bloc in a cursory manner.
This is no way to dispel the deep distrust that prevails between the international community and Iran.
Solidarity on the part of the international community is the best response to such evasiveness, which is why, in our resolution, we welcome the agreement reached in Berlin on 22 January on the drafting of a new UN Security Council resolution.
This will bring Russia and China on board, which will send a strong signal to Iran.
The resolution provides for additional measures as part of a concerted approach on the part of the international community.
I believe it is right that we should seek dialogue wherever possible but that we should also spell out time and again where our interests lie, namely on the one hand in human rights but on the other also in cooperation, though only if and when Iran recovers its trust in this community of ours.
<D>
(FI) Mr President, Commissioner, my thanks go to Mr Parish for this debate.
Guaranteeing the welfare of animals is something that is very important.
The Commission needs to ensure that the Animal Transport Regulation is implemented and monitored consistently throughout the EU.
EU legislation on the transport of animals is strict.
Recurrent serious problems with animal transport are due to gross breaches of the law.
The current regulations on the time limit for animals in transport and their derogations are adequate if they are properly monitored and if, at the same time, top quality transport fleets are maintained.
These need to have proper ventilation, temperature control, a drinking water system and a satellite navigation system.
In addition, drivers have to be trained, and there need to be guidelines drawn up on the proper conditions for animal transport, as is now being done in many Member States.
I think it is important that the present Animal Transport Regulation is properly implemented everywhere in the EU and that the experiences gained from it are taken account of prior to any drafting of new regulations.
<D>
President-in-Office of the Council. - First of all, I would like extend my heartfelt thanks to Parliament and the Members who supported the Council's position.
I accept that there are different opinions; that is normal for parliaments.
However, it seems to me that the European Union has been given support at today's session.
I would like to answer some questions.
The first question is on the system we are envisaging for command, that is to say for future responsibilities, and here I am thinking, of course, of institutions in Kosovo.
The European Union has obviously sent a special representative to Kosovo.
In its declaration of independence, the Kosovo Parliament agreed, from the outset, to the provisions of the Ahtisaari Plan.
The provision of the entire plan will be built into the Kosovo constitution and into its legislation.
Accordingly, the task of the European Union's special envoy will be to monitor the local authorities and to safeguard the obligations which the new status demands.
After the International Civilian Office has been established, the European Union's Special Representative will become the High Representative for civilian affairs for the international community.
He will also give political guidance to EULEX.
I would like to add that the European Union has done much in recent days, primarily to calm the situation and secure adequate support for Kosovo.
In addition to the mission about which the Council made a decision a few days ago, I would like to mention yesterday's visit to Priština by the Secretary-General and the High Representative, Javier Solana.
I would like to quote just one sentence from his address.
Mr Solana said:
'I would like to transmit that the sentiment, the joy, that you spread so respectfully on the streets over the last days now has to be converted into positive and constructive energy in order to move society forward.'
'I would like to transmit that the sentiment, the joy, that you spread so respectfully on the streets over the last days now has to be converted into positive and constructive energy in order to move society forward.'
That means, I think, that all of us also wish our friends in Kosovo to be prepared to convert the energy they have displayed in the last few days into rational action that will secure a respectable European future not only for Kosovo, but also of course for Serbia.
I think much has been said in the speeches and Members' contributions today about Serbia deserving to continue on its path towards integration with the European Union, and as I was listening to the speeches by various representatives of this Parliament, I could not help envisaging that in the future Serbian will be spoken here too.
And, I hope, Albanian as well.
I trust we will hear the languages of countries which so badly wish to become members of this Parliament and the European Union.
However, in view of the remarks we heard from some of our Spanish friends, I would not say that harmonisation of the text of the decisions was not difficult for the General Affairs and External Relations Council, but in the end, we managed to agree with our Spanish and Cypriot colleagues on a text which reflects unanimity, joint decision-making and collective thinking.
Finally, I would like to say, Mr President, that naturally I have to agree with the speech by my colleague from Slovenia, Mr Kacin, when he spoke of the need for Serbs in Kosovo to accept Kosovo as their homeland too and take part in its government.
Of course, Kosovo is their country too and every delay by Kosovan Serbs in cooperating in the government of Kosovo may be detrimental.
May I say that these debates have given me encouragement and I would like to thank you, Mr President, and the ladies and gentlemen of the European Parliament for all these constructive comments.
<D>
(ES) Mr President, I would first like to discuss Mrs Ţicău's report.
This proposal is key to modernising the occupation of transport operator, through the uniform application of common rules in all Member States to authorise access to that profession.
In this respect I applaud and willingly welcome the Commission's proposal.
However, I would like to repeat a question that I raised during the debate on this report in the Committee on Transport and Tourism.
It is regarding the term 'good repute', which I put forward, and which, in the interests of consensus, I then withdrew and proposed substituting it with 'ethical standards'.
I am not in any way questioning this requirement; on the contrary, I agree that it should be required that transport managers should not have any serious criminal convictions or serious sanctions for infringements of Community legislation relating to road transport.
I do, however, advocate changing the term, because we are presuming bad practice in a profession that is a key sector of the European economy, that generates wealth, creates employment and guarantees the mobility of people and goods.
We should think carefully before assuming that someone is not of good repute to pursue an occupation if that is not proven.
Secondly, I would like to highlight the importance of Mr Grosch's report on common rules for access to the road haulage market.
The proposal for a regulation defines cabotage operations, putting an end to the current legal uncertainty.
It allows up to three consecutive transport operations for an international carriage of seven days.
However, we should go further in order to lift any restrictions on cabotage and achieve greater liberalisation of national markets.
Finally, I applaud the reduction in bureaucracy that this new proposal for a regulation brings in relation to the new simplified formats for the Community licence, copies of this licence and the drivers' certificates, that will help to reduce the delays caused by roadside checks.
Ladies and gentlemen, we need to make the transport sector more efficient and more competitive.
<D>
Mr President, thank you for the opportunity to speak.
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your comments.
I am pleased to hear that you share my concerns and visions for the future of European research.
With regard to the aforementioned quotas, I believe that I have been a little misunderstood.
I am not talking about quotas for researchers, but it is very clear that one of the most important barriers to employing and utilising the female talent base lies in the composition of recruitment committees.
This is because they are not gender-neutral, and I therefore believe that we must do something about that.
We cannot continue to ignore this problem and hope that tomorrow will be brighter and that it will happen all by itself.
We must demand political action now.
The Commission has of course been the progressive player in this matter, as a unit for women and research was created several years ago in the Directorate-General for Research.
It is the Member States that are lagging behind.
It is their commitment that will be essential in relation to securing change within the university and research institutions.
I would like to thank my fellow Members, the Secretariat and the Commission for their cooperation.
I was very pleased with the cooperation of researchers and the European Platform of Women Scientists in particular - special thanks must go to them.
<D>
Mr President, the euro is the successful outcome of a vision and political will, and not the product of the market.
It demonstrates the best that Europe can achieve when everyone joins forces.
I also want, of course, on this occasion to salute and thank on our behalf, on our children's behalf and on everyone else's behalf, the founding fathers and the architects of this success: Pierre Werner, who is with us, Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, President Giscard d'Estaing, the President of the European Commission Jacques Delors, Chancellor Helmut Kohl, President François Mitterrand, Baron Alexandre Lamfalussy, Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa, Philippe Maystadt and everyone else whom I have not mentioned.
I would also, however, like to pay tribute to the actions of your predecessors, Mr President, the actions of my predecessors, Karl von Wogau, who is still with us, and of Christa Randzio-Plath, who is also with us today.
The actions of this Parliament played a crucial role in that, at the time of the transition to the euro, we were not only concerned about the transfer of accounts in the banks but also about our citizens, so that they could adapt to, get used to and adopt this new currency which was going to be theirs.
I also believe that this action by our institution must be recalled and given credit.
I am also pleased that this ceremony can take place here, in the European Parliament, the home of democracy for all Europe's citizens.
After all, the euro is first and foremost the concern of us all, and then of the banks.
It is certainly the concern of Europeans, as they are happy to tell us.
Some governments are loath to provide Europe with symbols.
However, Europeans themselves have adopted the euro as a symbol of belonging to the European Union.
Of course, we are not all using the euro.
There were 11 of us to start with, and now there are 16.
We are expecting others to join us.
However, I do get the feeling that this crisis is tempting some countries to reconsider whether they should belong to the euro area or not.
I think that this is the best proof of our success.
Europe makes progress, as is so often the case, by demonstrating its efficiency and on this occasion to mark its 10th anniversary, we can clearly see that the assessment of the euro is largely a positive one.
Some countries which were hesitant could now knock on the door of the euro area.
We can only encourage them to do this under the terms of the Treaty, which have never been revised and which are useful terms allowing Europe to progress in economic and monetary matters on the basis of the two pillars of consolidation and enlargement.
However, an anniversary is also a time for looking to the future.
The euro, which has been enriched by these last 10 years, must now open up new areas for development, not that we have not dealt with these at all, but simply because they are still work in progress ahead of us.
On the subject of economic cooperation, Jean-Claude Juncker described the crisis that we are going through.
It is not a normal situation.
In this current crisis we all know that, if we had made progress in the Economic Union as quickly as we have in the Monetary Union, we would be even better off today.
Let us learn then the lessons from this.
It is not normal for us to focus on the budget deficit balances and not on the quality of public spending.
Governments must learn to talk together about their economic policies.
It is not normal for Member States to borrow at such different rates of interest when they have the same currency and the same rate of interest set by the European Central Bank.
The same applies when it comes to supervising the financial markets.
President Giscard d'Estaing mentioned Article 105(6), which is our common platform, allowing us to make progress.
I think that one of the lessons from this crisis is that it actually shows that the European Central Bank will need to have a supervisory role.
We do not want to disconnect the supervision of the financial markets from macroprudential supervision.
However, to achieve this, we will also need, as political leaders, to think about achieving a balance.
If the European Central Bank sees its responsibilities strengthened, it will have to be indicated how the institutional balance on the whole needs to be established in the future.
I would like to make one final remark on the international role of the euro.
I agree that we must not demand the exorbitant privilege of being the reserve currency.
However, it is not normal either for us to have taken 10 years to create the euro and then, 10 years after the transition to the euro, we are still passive in the international arena and the strong voice of the euro is not being heard more clearly in the process of restoring some balance to the global monetary system.
Finally, I believe that the euro is much more than just a currency.
This is why it is a major issue for this Parliament.
It is a tool at the service of our citizens who are going through the deepest crisis in years.
We must then use this wonderful creation, this symbol of Europe to help our citizens come through this crisis in the best conditions possible.
<D>
(PL) Madam President, the European Schools exist on the basis of the Convention signed in 1957.
There have been many changes in Europe over the past 50 years: a series of enlargements, an increase in the number of institutions and agencies and much more flexible employment contracts.
There can be no doubt, therefore, that the European Schools system also needs change and reform.
There are a number of important areas that need changing.
The issue that interests me the most is pupil selection, that is, the division into categories: one, two or three.
After all, on the one hand the EU is trying to increase the mobility of European citizens in the labour market and to eliminate barriers and, on the other, it is blocking access to the Schools to children of potential employees of various institutions and companies from the whole of the EU.
A solution needs to be found to the problem of overcrowding in certain schools.
Measures also need to be taken as regards children with special needs.
Finally, I would like to ask for consideration to be given to the possibility of creating European Schools in the new Member States.
<D>
in writing. - (PL) The problem of climate change and combating the degradation of the natural environment rose to the top of the European Union's agenda in 2007.
The European Commission's proposals are a concrete expression of the ambitious aims outlined in March of last year.
They reflect the leading role assumed by our Community of 27 nations as regards limiting greenhouse gas emissions.
I do not wish to query the aims or ambitions, but it must be recognised that the European Community is composed of two groups of countries that were until recently divided by the so-called Iron Curtain.
For many decades now, the Western democracies have been sensitive to the need to protect the natural environment.
This resulted in environmental standards worthy of imitation on other continents.
In contrast, the countries of the former Comecon underwent rapid industrialisation.
In particular, this involved developing the potential of the iron and steel industry, the heavy chemicals industry and other types of industry with detrimental effects on the environment.
The process of adjustment to the Union's standards was exceptionally costly and it is not surprising that so many transitional periods were negotiated by these countries in their Accession Treaties.
In a very short period of time the countries of Central and Eastern Europe underwent a dramatic transformation in this regard.
Pursuant to the European Commission's proposals, these countries are now facing new challenges that may be more than they can cope with and could affect their opportunities for development.
Finding the correct balance between environmental requirements, the right conditions for competitiveness and job protection is something that concerns the European Union as a whole.
It is, however, particularly important for the countries that are struggling to catch up.
<D>
on behalf of the PSE. - (ET) Colleagues, on Human Rights Day, 10 December, the television broadcasting station Belsat began operating in Poland with the aim of broadcasting independent information on what is happening in Belarus, Europe and elsewhere in the world to Belarusians.
The channel, which broadcasts mainly in Belarusian, now reaches some 10% of Belarusians via satellite.
The station is working under constant pressure.
At the end of March KGB and police in Belarus carried out a raid to apprehend Belsat's local reporters.
Their basic tools, i.e. laptop computers and broadcasting technology, were seized.
Independent reporters live in constant fear of interrogation and arrest.
The situation in Belarus, an immediate neighbour of the European Union, is as harsh as it was behind the iron curtain.
As the Chair of the Moldova delegation and an Estonian, I state here that the citizens of Belarus, which was also part of the Soviet Union, today need independent information as much as they need oxygen.
Belsat is an excellent start, but good television does not come cheap.
The journalists working for Belsat Belarus are fighting for democracy; they visited us in the European Parliament in March and they need our comprehensive support.
I call upon the European Commission and all our Member States to support Belsat financially and morally.
Let us not forget that a free press is the cornerstone of democracy.
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, while talking, debating and approaching an essential common position on the evaluation of crimes of totalitarian regimes in Europe, one obstacle is most evident as a barrier to more rapid moral and legislative success.
That main obstacle is the hardly understandable position of today's Russian Government.
As far as the crimes committed in the Stalinist past of the USSR are concerned, instead of distancing themselves with proper condemnation of gross crimes against humanity, war crimes and other wrongdoings, Russia's ruling elite is not following the good example of denazified Germany.
No, the Soviet Führer, Stalin, is praised, his own and his gang's crimes denied or marginalised and the victims humiliated and mocked.
This strange political behaviour, so detrimental to Russia itself, cannot tear out the truth about deeds but continues to affect wrongly our European standards and fairness of evaluations.
We should realise how such hypocrisy and double standards are helpful for various neo-Nazis etc.
If anyone says: well, before official Russia changes its mind, we have to freeze ours and follow the Kremlin's mind or postpone our evaluations and decisions, that is an entirely and deeply wrong stance.
No matter how harshly Russian-State-hired political historians will try to rewrite the European history of the facts, the two bloodiest international tyrannies of the 20th century, along with the smaller national dictatorships, should and will be assessed properly.
This has to be the best way Europe can assist the Russia of the future.
<D>
in writing. - (HU) Croatia is one step away from the fulfilment of its historic goal.
The question is what this step will be like.
Will it be a long step fraught with obstacles, perhaps even artificial ones?
Or will it be an easier, shorter step, one that is based on cooperation and one that appreciates the performance of the difficult commitments undertaken so far?
The Croatian people have done considerable work to ensure the conclusion of the accession negotiations, and the recognition of their cooperation is well deserved, whether it be for their efforts in the reduction of corruption, conflicts of interest and organised crime, or for the improvement of their neighbourhood policy.
Some questions, of course, still remain open to this day, most of them being of a bilateral nature, but it is important to stress that these should not be confused with European matters.
I am convinced that Croatia is worthy of becoming a Member State of the EU, and is worthy of successfully concluding the negotiations during the term of the Hungarian Presidency.
The position of Croatia in the Western Balkans is of strategic importance.
This role is reinforced by the three agreements signed by Croatia and the Hungarian Government on the strengthening of energy supply security, joint research in cross-border hydrocarbon fields and the storage of oil supplies.
I honestly wish for the Croatian people that all natural - and perhaps artificially erected - barriers are removed from the path of their accession, because Croatia is not only mature enough for, but also worthy of joining the EU.
What I ask of you, my fellow Members, is to contribute with your supporting votes to Croatia joining the EU as soon as possible, because that way, the accession would be achieved in the symbolic 20th year of Croatia's independence.
<D>
(FR) Mr President, a few weeks ago Ireland said 'no', and I think that, as we all know, this illustrates the increasing split between European citizens.
This 'no' should obviously not be underestimated, and I think that, on the contrary, it should force all political leaders to take into account the expectations and concerns of the people and try to provide answers to them, whatever treaty is in force.
It is not the case that if we had the Lisbon Treaty tomorrow everything would disappear with a wave of a magic wand.
The French Presidency has chosen to focus on four areas, which is obviously very helpful, especially regarding climate change.
However, during this time of deep crisis, a financial and food crisis, an explosion in the price of raw materials, and increasingly scarce and increasingly expensive oil, I think that what the people are expecting is not only a matter of issues, but also a matter of vision; what the people are expecting is a matter of prospects.
Right now I would like to suggest three avenues for reflection.
The first concerns the fundamental, essential issue of our identity.
I believe, I have a deep conviction, that there is a European model, that there is a European blueprint for society.
This European model is economic, sustainable and also social.
This European model, for example, seeks to combat the growing inequalities.
There is, therefore, a European model, and we should be proud of it, we should assert it, carry it, take it up, defend it and protect it.
That is the first avenue.
Then there is a second avenue for reflection.
I think that we need a new vision for the organisation of the world.
In saying that, I am thinking particularly of Africa.
I am thinking of the issue of agricultural products; I think we should stop subsidising exports of our agricultural products and instead work towards Africa being self-sufficient in terms of food and energy.
This is the new revolution that we need in order to have a fairer world in the future.
(Applause)
Finally, I believe, and we should never stop reminding ourselves of this, that there are European values that we should never renounce: they are called democracy and human rights, and they are valid for us in Europe, and will be valid in the future of the Union for the Mediterranean, where it will not be about doing business above all while neglecting human rights.
The issue of human rights is essential for the coming decades; it is the deep-seated identity of Europe and deserves to be defended.
Mr President, these are some of the questions that I feel are before us; they concern fundamental matters, in other words, the vision and the deeper meaning that we must and want to give to Europe.
These questions are not only a matter of politics, but also a matter of conscience.
<D>
in writing. - (SK) During the period 19 - 27 July I visited New Zealand as a member of an 11-strong delegation from the European Parliament.
This advanced and affluent country with a European spirit lies more than 27,000 km away from Slovakia.
Our meetings with the students of the European Institute at the university in Auckland and at Canterbury University in Christchurch were very inspiring.
We talked about the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Community in the area of research, technological development and demonstration activities and about the opportunities for cooperation between the EU and New Zealand in the areas of science and research.
It is for this reason, within the framework of the consultation process, that I support the signing of the Science and Technology Cooperation Agreement between the European Community and the government of New Zealand, and I therefore voted in favour of the report of the rapporteur Angelika Niebler.
New Zealand is one of the least polluted countries in the world, a fact of which it is justly proud.
New Zealanders are guided by the slogan 'Green, clean and safe'.
Hydroelectric power accounts for 2/3 of the country's electricity output.
Massive supplies of hot water are also used to produce electricity.
There is no nuclear power at all.
I firmly believe that mutual cooperation in the fight against climate change, seeking common approaches in the areas of science, research and innovation, will prove beneficial to both sides.
<D>
in writing. - (RO) I would like to emphasize the importance of physical education classes in the EU schools and secondary schools.
For the moment, physical education remains the only discipline in the school curriculum that aims at preparing children for a healthy way of life.
I appreciate the EU initiative to increase the number of physical education classes in schools.
Together with the increase in the number of physical education classes, we should also take into consideration two important issues: I refer to attractiveness and the possibility to have differentiated physical education classes.
My statement relies on the discussions I have had with pupils and sports teachers in Romania.
Unfortunately, the fact that physical education classes are not attractive leads to an increase in absenteeism.
One of the reasons is the absence of an adequate material basis to diversify classes.
Another problem is the absence of special physical education classes for overweight or obese young people.
Physical education classes have the same degree of intensity both for healthy children and for children with problems.
Thus, sometimes, young people are forced to remain off the sports field.
These are some of the problems we find in several European Union Member States and for which we have to find solutions.
I invite the European Commission to come up with solutions and even with examples of good practice in the Member States.
<D>
(DA) Mr President, Parliament has today chosen to formally recognise agriculture as a strategic sector in the context of food security.
This is something that we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe have recognised for many years.
Likewise, we also recognise the fact that agriculture is a strategic sector when it comes to food quality, public health and sustainable, economic growth.
However, this does not justify school fruit and milk programmes.
Nor does it justify more market-supported milk subsidy programmes.
We would like to point out that we voted against these proposals and we regret the fact that they were voted through.
However, this must not destroy the overall picture, which is the fact that we must provide good conditions for agriculture.
Butter mountains, wine lakes and school programmes are not the way forward, however.
Farmers' income will not be secured by intervention and distortion of the market.
Instead, we must invest in research and give farmers the opportunity to use new technologies for alternative forms of income.
Overall, we consider the report to be good, and therefore we voted in favour of it as a whole.
<D>
Mr President, own-initiative reports are certainly justified in this Parliament.
We are a parliament of 27 countries and peoples, and there are many questions preying on people's minds, both within the EU and in our relations with other parts of the world.
However, I also agree with those who have said that Parliament has increasingly developed from being an advisory assembly to a legislative body.
The Treaty of Lisbon will take that a big step further.
Therefore, we must set priorities.
I hear that we spend only 17.4% of our time on legislative work: this is not enough.
We are under stress, under time pressure.
We want better lawmaking, so we need more time and priorities.
It is also a good thing that we are now saying that not every report has to be discussed again in plenary.
It is possible to vote without first debating, and Members can make a written statement if they want to express their views on the report.
It does not have to be done orally in a plenary session.
Madam Vice-President, I feel it is right that the rapporteur has both the first and the last word in Parliament because, as a kind of 'chamber of the citizens', we must express ourselves at the beginning and the end of a debate.
That is a good innovation.
Last but not least the subject of the questions.
This system is very good, until it is abused.
We have heard the figures - that eight Members are putting 25% of the questions.
That makes nearly 1 700 questions from eight members.
We can observe that they are very hardworking, but it looks very much as if the EU system is being wantonly abused here, as in many other cases, by opponents of the EU.
We must introduce a rule for this, and the guidelines are a benchmark, a framework that we can work by.
Congratulations to Mr Corbett for knuckling down time and again to further develop Parliament.
Thank you very much.
<D>
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, with the introduction of the Lisbon strategy, the European Union set itself an ambitious goal: to significantly reduce poverty by 2010.
Since then, the Union has set up instruments for achieving that goal.
The open method of coordination in the field of social protection and social inclusion has helped to strengthen the fight against poverty and social exclusion, and has supported the efforts of the Member States.
This cooperation between Member States has had very good results.
I shall mention three examples: there are now 22 Member States that have set themselves a target figure for combating child poverty; citizens and companies are now very closely involved in the national strategies to combat poverty; and social inclusion strategies have been incorporated into many policy areas: employment, education and vocational training, health and housing.
All the relevant policies have therefore been brought to bear in the fight against social exclusion.
The renewed social agenda which the Commission adopted on 2 July 2008 sets seven priority areas of activity, including the fight against poverty and social exclusion.
The renewed social agenda also proposes strengthening the open method of coordination.
The European plan to stimulate growth and employment, which was submitted to the heads of states and governments at the European Summit in December 2008, aims to address the impact of the financial and economic crisis and also to strengthen the reforms already under way within the scope of the Lisbon strategy for growth and employment.
The Commission has also undertaken to regularly monitor the social impact of the financial and economic crisis in the Member States and the measures taken at national level.
This tool for monitoring the social impact of the crisis should be published quarterly, and understandably it would focus mainly on the most vulnerable groups.
The Commission will also continue to cooperate with the Member States to ensure effective implementation of its recommendations adopted in October 2008 on the active inclusion of people who are furthest removed from the job market.
In particular, the aim of this recommendation is to increase the effectiveness of the minimum wage schemes, which are still insufficiently developed in many Member States.
In other words, it is essential to enable every citizen to achieve a decent standard of living, especially during the current crisis.
I would also like to remind you that 2010 will be the European Year of the Fight against Poverty and Social Exclusion.
It will focus on the following: support for observance of the rights and opportunities for socially excluded people to actively reintegrate themselves into society; emphasis on the responsibility of each member of society in the fight against poverty; broadening the tried and tested methods in the field of social inclusion; strengthening the commitment of the main political actors.
I think the measures I have mentioned testify to the fact that Europe is constantly trying, in a concrete way, to address the needs of the most vulnerable groups, especially in the current economic situation.
I hope the Member States will respond positively to the Commission's call to resolve the social consequences of the crisis.
For this purpose, they can make use of the Community instruments available to them, especially the European Social Fund and the European Fund for Adjustment to Globalisation.
<D>
Mr President, I have listened carefully to the Commissioner.
There are four cotton-growing countries in the EU: Greece, Spain, Bulgaria and, on a very small scale, Portugal.
When I embarked on this report, I worked closely with a great number of people, received recommendations and took part in discussions, so I can say that it is the product of long, extensive cooperation.
I worked with members of my committee, whom I thank, with Spanish representatives of the manufacturing and cotton-ginning sectors, and, of course, with my compatriots from Greece.
I should like to point out that the report was approved by the Committee on Agriculture by 28 votes to 6.
This shows a high level of acceptance.
Allow me to mention briefly the 2004 proposal to support cotton.
It was annulled by the European Court of Justice.
It called for a 35% coupled payment and a 65% decoupled one.
Then in subsequent years cotton-growing went into decline, and there was eventually a 50% decrease in Spain and one of about 20% in Greece.
Cotton farms in Spain shrunk by 25% and in Greece by 11%.
The aim of this report is that cotton should continue to be grown in Europe: the EU as a whole accounts for only 2% of world production.
We have therefore agreed that the funding earmarked for the cotton-growing Member States will be maintained in full.
Of course, to avoid the risk of cotton-growing going into decline or becoming uneconomical, we have requested a small increase in the funding per hectare and I am delighted to hear that you accept.
It necessarily follows that as the overall sum remains the same, the cultivated area will be reduced.
There is, of course, absolutely no implication that problems will arise if a Member State wishes to increase the cultivated area as it pleases without any defined upper ceiling.
The ratio between coupled and decoupled aid remains at 35-65%.
However, we have requested that Member States should, if they wish, be allowed to change their proportion of coupled aid, without going below the lower limit of 35%.
Let me say here that one thing should be made clear.
The new area of land will not represent a defined ceiling, with penalties imposed for exceeding it as before.
On the contrary, it is a way of safeguarding the current overall aid to the sector.
Indeed, we believe the proposed increase in aid will be a strong incentive to retain the crop.
We also propose the creation of a national envelope of 1% funded by a deduction from the coupled aid, by unabsorbed appropriations, and from the EUR 22 million transferred to the 2nd pillar.
What will the national envelope achieve?
Firstly, its aims are ambitious: for instance, aid will be provided for research into new varieties requiring less water and lower pesticide use, thus greatly benefiting the environment.
Secondly, the quality of cotton produced will be improved, and the ginning industry will be modernised.
The draft report meets the needs of cotton growers in the Member States while complying with the goals of the EU.
It deals with actual funding and at the same time introduces environmental measures, which are vital in the EU.
Allow me in conclusion to mention the excellent cooperation and support I enjoyed from all my fellow Members in drafting the report, which enabled us to introduce new ideas and recommendations.
I am confident that the implementation of the new scheme will help preserve a flourishing cotton-producing sector in the EU and a viable ginning industry.
Lastly, I would like to thank the Commission once again for the constructive way in which it has responded to the needs of the cotton-producing countries.
We have finally achieved a result and will be able to point the Council in the right direction.
<D>
Vice-President of the Commission. - On the question about Plan D and the communication about 'Debate Europe', let me say that I see it as our duty, together with Member States and the other EU institutions, to communicate with citizens about all our policies and positions.
While, on the Treaty, Member States of course have the main responsibility, the Commission must also stand ready to inform and explain.
Our recent communication, 'Debate Europe', aims at promoting active dialogue between citizens and decision-makers and, although not specifically referring to the Lisbon Treaty, or to the Lisbon Treaty only, actions taken under 'Debate Europe' may be connected with communicating on the Treaty.
The Treaty is one of our communication priorities for 2008.
Our activities have been decentralised and differentiated to fit the national realities in each of our Member States, and this is 'going local' working in practice.
Our representatives have worked with each Member State and Parliament information offices to draw up national communication plans to respond to different needs, and the activities have included liaising with national stakeholders, training for journalists, information relays and multipliers, discussions with civil society and events at schools and universities.
We have prepared a broad range of support materials including PowerPoint presentations, elements for speeches, questions and answers, fact-sheets on different areas - all aiming to help communicators provide the facts on the issues.
And from Brussels, as you know, the Commission has also launched a website dedicated to the Treaty in the 23 official languages, and our on-line forum 'Debate Europe' has recently been relaunched with discussions on the Treaty proving one of the most popular areas, with many thousands of submissions.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, today's debate very much focused on households, and the Commission proposal goes beyond households: it is definitely also industry.
With all due respect to vulnerable consumers, what we are trying to achieve is a well-functioning market.
You cannot ever subsidise everything because it means taking from somebody to give to someone else; I know that there will be vulnerable consumers that we should pay due attention to, but basically what we are trying to achieve is a well-functioning interconnected European market based on the values and experiences that we have in other fields.
The energy market has only recently started to develop and it takes some time to put into place, but I believe that today's debate really shows that the Commission proposal addresses all the main areas correctly.
There have been slight doubts about whether the change is necessary.
I believe that change is necessary: not only the Commission's annual reports, but also the competitive sector inquiry has demonstrated this.
Parliament's Vidal-Quadras report said that we need a change and we need proposals.
On the ground we have also had some developments in competition law recently.
The difficulty is that if you can discover anti-competitive behaviour, it is all ex-post: you impose fines but the consumer has already paid the price.
So it is structural change that is necessary and I believe that the proposals we have made are a response to it.
There are a couple of issues where I believe we are going beyond just an energy market proposal.
Let us start with the Agency.
I completely agree that an independent Agency is a key.
The difficulty I have is that we also have case-law which draws boundaries, and the Commission is made as strong as possible, within legal boundaries, if we have an Agency.
On comitology, I understand Parliament's questions about comitology but this is the procedure that we have and we should use this procedure to achieve the result.
On infringement, it was Mr Paasilinna who said that this is the procedure we have, and we should use it because we do not have another procedure.
There was a question about consumer rights.
There is subsidiarity, but aviation is more of a cross-border issue.
I believe the Energy Charter is more closely related to subsidiarity.
We set a good example, but should we really bring in European legislation?
I have some doubts.
I am not necessarily against it, but there is a boundary between where European legislation is needed and where national law starts in this respect.
At any rate I believe these are the issues, and Parliament will surely find the right approach.
I shall finish by thanking Mrs Morgan, Mrs De Vits, Giles Chichester and Alejo Vidal-Quadras once again for their excellent reports.
I think that the debate clearly showed that there was a lot of internal debate, and I am looking forward to the vote tomorrow, because the Vidal-Quadras report paved the way for us to make the proposal.
I know that Council and Parliament will need to work to find a balanced solution.
Both sides are ready.
Much depends on the vote tomorrow where Parliament will stand, but I clearly understand that there is political will to find agreement and we will have the proposal adopted during this legislature for the benefit of our consumers, and I think that is great.

<D>
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, it is indeed true that, 50 years after the Treaties of Rome were concluded, we have made little progress regarding equality for women in the labour market.
The figures are alarming: 80% of part-time workers are women, and only 57% of women are in employment, compared with 72% of men.
Wage inequality has also remained stable since 2003, and has only changed by 1% since 2000.
These are alarming figures, which all of us here lament.
We have also referred to the fact that women are doubly disadvantaged, because this wage inequality is translated into differences in pension rights and social standards, and we also have a tax and social system that continues to penalise women, in that, for example, unmarried couples and double-income families are still disadvantaged in many tax systems, such as in Germany.
The Commission has stated that there will be legislative proposals, but why are they coming so late?
Why have so many years gone by, in this parliamentary term, without any proposals in this field?
We in Parliament have already called for proposals.
With regard to quotas, we have said that there should be legal requirements.
We also have Member States, such as Sweden, that have set objectives with a timeframe.
Why do we not make use of the fact that we have these gender requirements to encourage the Member States to make efforts to resolve this shameful pay gap.
In Germany, as has already been said, we are unfortunately third from bottom, with a shameful pay gap of 23%.
We also need to make it clear that a statutory minimum wage will bring about changes particularly in sectors primarily employing women.
However, we must also have the courage to make it clear ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
<D>
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, tomorrow at 11.30 a.m. the Prime Ministers will sign a final Treaty none of them have read.
They are signing a bundle of amendments they cannot even understand.
Yesterday the Danish Parliament refused a referendum on a Treaty they have not read.
They breached the Danish Constitution and may be taken to court so we can have a referendum.
A few of them may have read a full draft; I doubt it.
The final edition is still impossible to read for one simple reason: it is not consolidated.
The IGC has decided that readable versions will only be printed when the Treaty is ratified by all 27 Member States.
Do not read, sign, is a cynical moral.
All negotiations in the IGC and the linguistic lawyers' group have been kept absolutely secret so far as many Members in this Parliament are concerned.
The numbering system has been changed three times to make any comparison technically impossible before the signing.
There is not even a table for comparison with the October published edition.
First they undo two referendums rejecting the Constitution.
Then they negotiate in secret and keep the content under a new name.
I still offer a good bottle of wine for just one example of a law which can be approved under the Constitution and not under the Lisbon Treaty.
Even the most experienced legal expert in the Danish Foreign Office has admitted there is not one.
In an expert hearing in the Danish Parliament, I asked three times to have some examples of national law areas where the Lisbon Treaty, with its horizontal clauses and fundamental principles, cannot reach.
I did not get one valid example.
The Lisbon Treaty will dissolve the existing EU, establish a new state with joint citizenship, legal personality and all the tools of nation states.
Most laws will be adopted by civil servants in secret.
The democratic deficit will grow.
My group proposes the signing should be cancelled until you have read the final text.
(Applause)
<D>
(PL) Madam President, Commissioner, here in the European Parliament we keep coming back to the problem of Belarus, a country that, in fact, lies in the centre of Europe, looked at geographically, bordering the European Union.
It is an exceptional country by European standards in that it does not have a liberal democracy or rule of law and it has censorship.
Today's debate takes place on the anniversary of the Prague Spring in 1968, an anniversary of the moment when, in Europe, people finally said 'enough' to censorship and press controls.
Today I wanted to devote my speech to just this issue in Belarus.
We had a very strange hacker attack on independent internet media: on Charter 97, Radio Liberty and the Belarus Partisan.
What was strange was the hacker attack began the day before the opposition demonstration that was to take place on the anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster.
The internet media in Belarus are really the only independent media as the majority of the media are completely under the control of the Belarus regime.
Charter 97 are visited by about 9 000 surfers daily and, in Belarus, over 3 000 000 families are connected to the internet, over 30% of the total population.
This shows the dynamism and vitality of society in Belarus.
Commissioner, the European Union must seriously consider what measures to take in order to help the ordinary people in Belarus.
<D>
I want to thank the Commissioner for her response.
I would have liked it if Commissioner Mandelson was here as well, because I know he had a meeting in America last week, where he was disappointed with the response.
But, very briefly, you spoke about the developing countries and you mentioned, as part of that, Brazil and India.
From an industrial point of view and from an export point of view, they cannot be classed as developing countries.
Yet at the same time, from a cultural point of view, they are classed as developing countries with regard to the benefits that they will get.
Should Europe give more in the agricultural field, in particular when you see that the US Farm Bill, which has now come into being, is taking more subsidies out of the package that was originally negotiated, and Europe seems to be giving all of the leeway, whereas America is not taking any of the pain?
Is that a correct way to continue?
And, finally, if autumn is the deadline, the end of October is autumn.
Winter starts on 1 November.
So do you see a time frame there for that to be successful?
<D>
in writing. - I voted for this report, despite the numerous loopholes within it and the derogations granted to 10 new Member States.
Why vote for an imperfect report?
Because it does make some progress when measured against the current regime.
There will be an EU-wide cap for the ETS sector, and Member States will have less power in the process.
The principle of a full auction of permits for the power sector has been maintained.
The aviation sector has been granted only a small percentage of new access to the CDM.
But the main importance of the revised scheme is that it provides the architecture for an important part of the post-Kyoto agreement.
We now have a scheme that other countries can join and use to help drive down their emissions - if they limit the pre-auction elements and set ambitious targets.
The use of the revenue will be closely watched.
Member States cannot simply look on this as an addition to their coffers.
It must be used to help the transformation to a low-carbon, sustainable economy, which the world needs.
<D>
rapporteur. - (NL) Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for all your encouraging words.
I believe that I have found a great deal of support in this House.
As the Commissioner said in his introductory speech, the positions of the Commission, the Council and Parliament are growing together; something that it was not possible to achieve at first reading.
In fact it was downright impossible, despite the fact that I held consultations with both the Slovenian and the Portuguese Presidencies on two occasions.
The fact that these positions are growing together is evidenced by the Commissioner's words on biocides.
He said that the Commission was considering revising that directive.
I wish to remain non-committal, and I trust that the wording of the proposal for a regulation, based on a text already adopted in the Klaß report, is non-committal.
Secondly, I most definitely take note of the Commission's offer to make the best possible use of the statistics already available on the production of pesticides, which represents an important contribution to the debate, including with a view to the second reading.
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you once again; I shall not keep you any longer.
It is already late and I think we have all earned a little relaxation.
<D>
Ladies and gentlemen, according to my fellow Member, Elmar Brok, the report on relations with the national parliaments gives an excellent overview of the tasks facing the European Parliament after the final ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon by all Member States.
Strengthening the role of national parliaments in the legislative process of the European Union will not only speed up the transposition of European legislation into national legislation, it will also provide EU citizens with yet another means of participating in government.
The positive results achieved so far based on cooperation in COSAC must be used as a basis for increasing the participation of parliamentarians from all Member States.
I think that it is especially important that we include representatives of the parliaments in the candidate countries for accession to the European Union in this effort as well.
This will help us make their accession to the EU a simpler, smoother process.
This issue is not examined either in the report or in the Treaty of Lisbon, but I believe that Parliament will find mechanisms for achieving this.
Finally, I would like to stress that national parliaments will need to strengthen their administrative capacity and ensure there is adequate funding so that they can fully exercise their new powers.
Thank you for your attention.
<D>
author. - (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is a poem by Ruy Cinatti which I have committed to memory and which reads: 'Perhaps we will be defeated or embattled, but only united'.
Unfortunately, on 11 February, crisis returned to East Timor, once again at the hands of the same people who were responsible for the crisis two years ago.
This prompts us to ask questions about the return of those who would harm the stability of this country and the gravity of an attack which seriously injured, and could even have fatally injured, the President of the Republic, José Ramos-Horta, and which also, fortunately without any personal consequences, affected the Prime Minister, Xanana Gusmão.
The violence and the disruption of the normal functioning of the institutions have once again laid bare the failures of a country with the history and circumstances of East Timor, which courageously fought and is fighting for independence, democracy and progress.
Anyone having supported East Timor from the beginning cannot fail to feel renewed sadness at this incident which we vehemently condemn.
We hope that President Ramos-Horta will fully recover and we call for a thorough investigation into what happened and into the necessary response to this.
Unfortunately, the international forces were slow to act, with the exception of the Portuguese GNR (National Republican Guard).
There are also clear failings in the rule of law in East Timor which is not functioning fully and which has in fact never functioned fully.
East Timor needs to rebuild the very core of its security system in order to ensure law and order.
The international community must assist the East Timorese people in these steps.
This is not a failed state; it is a state with failings that we must support.
However, the main responsibility obviously lies with the East Timorese people who must try to achieve a cross-party compromise for lasting peace and respect for the rule of law and judicial decisions, without hesitation, without prevarication and without complacency.
They have already managed to reach agreement on what we would call a national consensus with regard to the very core of the state's operation.
It is this consensus that Ruy Cinatti referred to in his poem which is the most pressing need of East Timor.
As a result, dear friends, we must help the people of East Timor to help themselves and make their country stronger.
<D>
(LT) I voted for this document by Thomas Mann because it reflects the problems of intergenerational interaction.
Usually, we talk of the European Union's demographic problems from the point of view of young people.
This document attempts to combine the specific characteristics of all the generations and related problems in health, education, labour and similar sectors, seeking balanced solutions to those problems.
As far as the older generation is concerned, we should be grateful for its contribution to the development of the European Union, both economically and culturally.
We must ensure that these people can grow old with dignity.
However, due to ageing Europe, it seems that it will be quite difficult to achieve this.
We must therefore not only create conditions for the improvement of family policy, but bring up a young generation which would be able to create added value, i.e. through the education system and non-formal education.
Of course, we must make efforts as regards the integration of young people into the labour market.
So thank you for this report.
<D>
- (CS) Mr President, Commissioner, there is no doubt that new rules of play are needed in the wine-making sector.
European viticulture is the last part of our agricultural policy that is still not reformed and still works on the principle of 'the higher the yield, the more money from Brussels'.
This often leads to wine producers paying more attention to quantity rather than quality, which has not escaped our European customers.
They are increasingly choosing wines from California, Chile or South Africa in preference to our Moravian, Czech, French or Italian wines.
We should support quality and competitiveness.
However, this must not involve discriminating against certain Member States while favouring others.
If we really want to agree on a reform of the wine sector, it cannot include the proposed ban on the use of beet sugar for wine enrichment.
Each of our countries has different climatic conditions and different traditions.
The geographic environment of the countries situated in the more northerly parts of Europe is vastly different from that of the southern ones.
Our colder climate often makes it necessary to enrich our wines with sugar.
In my country sugar has been used for wine enrichment for over 200 years; it is a traditional method.
The European Commission suggests banning sugar enrichment and substituting it with wine must concentrate instead.
Concentrated wine must, if not subsidised, costs at least twice the price of sugar, besides which it is only produced by a few countries.
If we were to use wine must concentrate or rectified must concentrate to enrich our wines, we would have to import it from other countries, which would contravene one of the basic principles of European viticulture, and that is defining the origin of the wine by the origin of the grapes.
Apart from that it would raise the price of the wine and consequently make it less competitive on the market.
That, in my opinion, would be discrimination.
While the Commission objects to the sweetening of wines, nobody seems to be concerned about their souring, that is about the addition of tartaric acid, mainly in the southern European countries.
I would like to raise a glass of honest wine to an honest reform without discrimination and favouritism.
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Mr President, the truth is that the situation is very worrying: suspension of constitutional guarantees, state of emergency, detention of many members of civil society, including lawyers such as Mr Ahsan, who is the President of the Supreme Court Bar Association, and of opponents, house arrest of the opposition leader Mrs Bhutto.
What do we do in this situation?
We have learnt that the Deputy Secretary of State at the US State Department, Mr Negroponte, will shortly visit Pakistan and that one Member State, the United Kingdom, has joined the United Nations in its call for the President to renounce his leadership of the army and lift the state of emergency within ten days.
What can we, as the European Union, do?
I believe that as a first step we must act with utmost caution.
I believe that the representative of the current Presidency has noted, very correctly, that Pakistan is a vital partner in the fight against terrorism and also a country with nuclear weapons.
I therefore believe that on the one hand the European Union must ask the Government to re-establish as far as possible - because we must not lose sight of the fact that terrorism is a factor in Pakistan, a major factor - to re-establish to some extent order and stability and constitutional rights and freedoms, and to release those people who have been unlawfully detained.
Furthermore, Commissioner, I would ask you to marshal your considerable capacities and efforts to ensure that free and fair elections can be held and, on the basis of the guarantees you referred to in your speech, that the European Union is present and has a presence in the process in Pakistan which is so very important for the stability of the region and all relations between that region and the European Union.
Therefore, Commissioner, we have great confidence in your capabilities, great confidence in your diplomatic action, great confidence in your efforts and we hope that they will genuinely have a successful outcome which will allow the European Union to have a presence in the electoral process.
<D>
(SV) Madam President, I would like to emphasise what is contained in the report and what is not.
I would like to thank the rapporteur.
He was sympathetic to the different views within the committee, and this means, Mr Špidla, that there is no requirement in report to tear up or redraft the Posting of Workers Directive.
To start with, the report contained a lot of condemnation and criticism of the Court, but this has been taken out.
This is what we are talking about now.
To emphasise this point I would like to quote in English:
I will quote the English text of paragraph 27: 'Welcomes the Commission's indication that it is now ready to re-examine the impact of the internal market on labour rights and collective bargaining'; and: 'Suggests that this re-examination should not exclude a partial review of the PWD' - meaning 'not exclude'.
(SV) Madam President, this means that there is no need for an amendment.
However, a review by the Commission of how this works in practice in the various Member States is welcomed.
If this review gives grounds for amendments, these should not be ruled out.
I wanted to say this because the Posting of Workers Directive plays a very important role.
One million people have the opportunity to work in different countries.
This is also about equal treatment, about equal rights to work in all parts of the European Union, even if someone has a collective agreement from his or her home country.
This is what it is all about.
As long as people comply with the rules of the Posting of Workers Directive they have the right to work anywhere in the EU.
This was also the conclusion arrived at by the Court in the Laval case, for example.
Commissioner, Madam President, the criticism levelled at the Court is no longer included in the committee's proposal and there is no requirement to tear up the Posting of Workers Directive.
It is important to remember this as we continue the debate.
<D>
(CS) All of us wish to breathe clean air and halt the melting of the glaciers.
At the same time, in spite of energy saving programmes, our need for energy is growing exponentially.
At stake is also Europe's dependency on gas and oil imports.
We must therefore invest in the development of renewable sources and tackle issues of nuclear power plants safety, in particular the question of final disposal of radioactive waste.
In this way we could obtain up to 14% of our energy from clean sources.
We cannot ignore, however, the fact that 32% of our energy comes from fossil fuels, employing 300 000 people and substantially polluting the environment.
This is why I welcome and have supported the report by Mr Reul on conventional sources.
I agree with the rapporteur that we should review investments and also develop those technologies capable of increasing the efficiency of fossil fuel energy production and reducing emissions.
We have much to work on.
<D>
I endorsed the resolution on the Southern Neighbourhood, which devotes particular attention to the situation in Libya.
In Libya, people who are fighting for their country's freedom are being killed.
We should be helping them.
Our resolution does help them, because it unequivocally condemns the dictator and supports those who want to make fundamental changes in Libya.
We do not know when or how the civil war will end.
We would like it to end quickly and for it to end in victory for the pro-democracy forces.
The European Union should make contact with the Interim Transitional National Council without delay and begin the process for its official recognition.
It should also encourage Libyans to make changes and to move towards democracy.
Thank you very much.

(PL) Mr President, what is agriculture in the European Union?
For some it is a thing of great value that needs to be protected, but for others, and sadly there are many in this group, it is ballast that they would like to be rid of.
We read in Mr Goepel's report that agriculture is one of the biggest industries in the EU.
That is good, but it is not enough.
Agriculture is not an industry and it is not just one of many sectors of the economy.
Agriculture is a pillar of food security.
We spend vast sums on the army and the police to guarantee physical security in our states and in our homes.
We pay large sums for energy security - we are seeking energy supplies that are more expensive but secure.
We must also spend large sums on protecting our agriculture, which offers us food security, and it is a shame that not everyone in the EU understands that.
<D>
in writing. - (RO) The European Union is a firm supporter of the Millennium Development Goals adopted by the United Nations and which established the targets to be achieved by 2015 as regards peace, security, development, governance and human rights.
Out of the 8 goals, special attention should be given to the improvement of maternal health, since over half a million women, mostly from Africa and Asia, die during pregnancy or childbirth.
The main cause leading to the increase in mortality rate at world level is the absence of qualified personnel to provide maternal assistance both during pregnancy and delivery.
This situation must be remedied by investing important funds in the underdeveloped countries, both in training specialized personnel and in medical equipment.
The targets for Romania, as regards the improvement of maternal health, are the reduction of mortality rate to 10 maternal deaths/100,000 births by 2015 and ensuring universal access to health services.
At present, Romania has negative natural growth, with a mortality rate of 12%.
By social assistance and information programmes, mother and child services, as well as additional financial support from the EU, the birth rate needs to resume its ascending trend and Romania to remain in the European Union's demographic strategy.
<D>
(PT) I welcome the initiatives and the actions undertaken at European level to combat neurodegenerative diseases and, in particular, Alzheimer's disease.
The Member States have been developing research efforts in this field.
It is important that cooperation among Member States is encouraged, to ensure increased coordination in terms of scientific research and technological development, and avoid fragmentation.
Joint programming of research is a valuable tool for reducing fragmentation by involving, at European level, the Member States, the public sector and the private sector.
This joint programming tool will be vital for the future of the European Research Area.
Developing the European Research Area lies at the heart of the research policy of the Treaty of Lisbon.
However, I am concerned about the implementation of this joint programming tool in terms of bureaucratic complexity and delays in administrative procedures.
I would therefore like to ask what the plans are for using a process based on economy of scale, combining efficiency, simplification and fast-tracking of administrative procedures so as to promote excellence and to encourage collaboration at European level, as called for by the importance of this issue.
<D>
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, the appalling mass rapes taking place in the Congo are being systematically organised and this means they are also being used as a military strategy, and that is not just war but sexual terror against women.
The brutal rapes are now being used by each of the warring factions in eastern Congo, whether they are local tribal militia or national army soldiers, as a symbol or power and as a means of intimidation.
It is precisely the weakest in society, namely women, children and even babies, who are being barbarously abused, deliberately injured, mutilated, infected with HIV and other infectious diseases and even killed.
We know, and have heard, that the level of brutality exceeds the powers of human imagination and we now urgently need to see rape being condemned at long last as a crime against humanity, as a war crime and as a form of torture.
Moreover, when the rape victims return traumatised and alone to their villages after painful operations - with many of the women losing all their genital organs - they find little or no shelter there.
I can therefore only support the remarks made by Mr Borrell and Mrs Scheele: we must also use European money to set up women's dormitories that can serve as a kind of refuge for those returning from their stay in hospital, and where they can then try to build a new life.
Indeed, in addition to the physical violence endured, the psychological violence that the victims have suffered is terrible beyond measure.
We know that most of these attacks have been carried out by rebels, but almost one fifth of the recorded incidents can be attributed to government troops and police, and it is indeed shameful that not a single culprit has yet been arrested or even charged.
The time for empty talk is therefore past.
We need political action from the UN and the European Union, for if we ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
<D>
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, the President-in-Office of the European Union and the Commissioners tend to begin their interventions with declarations on the protection and support of economic freedoms, freedom of competition and SMEs.
The transition from declarations to details generally involves reports similar to the one we are debating today, however.
The report proposes imposing a single rate of excise duty on all Member States and harmonisation of prices, on the pretext of making things more straightforward, easier and fairer.
This is taking place against the background of a premise considered a priori to be correct, namely that the best solution for the Member States of the European Union is a single tax system, a single monetary system, a single system for certification and marketing, a single regulatory production limits system and so on.
The proposal states that there are no differences in the cost of fuel supply within the Union, regardless of distance from sources of supply or labour costs.
All this is simply untrue.
I should like to pose the question as to what economic freedom and freedom of competition within the European Union actually mean.
Should we not be referring instead to economic compulsion and force?
Is it not the case that a single fuel price eliminating all competition is the ideal solution for multinational fuel enterprises to the detriment of consumers and small enterprises?
Is it not the case that a single fuel price favours highly developed countries over less developed ones?
Finally, if the Union adopts the aforementioned report, harmonising fuel prices under the slogan of unshackling enterprises and countries, will this not amount in fact to shackling them anew by way of taxation?
Worse, will it not simultaneously drive them barefoot into poverty?
We shall be voting against the report.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, a warm welcome to our counterparts from Macedonia who are following this debate.
Commissioner Rehn has said that we are encouraging Macedonia to move forward in the reform process.
'Yes,' we all say in unison, 'we want negotiations to be opened this year.'
However, we still need to name names.
The party who has put paid to Macedonia's ability to enter into alliance commitments is Greece, with its veto against the country's membership of NATO.
There is admittedly a naming dispute, but we cannot ignore the fact that, in 1995, Greece made a binding statement, valid under international law, agreeing that the naming dispute would never be an obstacle to Macedonia joining the international community, the EU or NATO.
Greece has broken this internationally binding agreement, and if we want to impose reforms in this regard, I say that Greece is in breach of European criteria and not Macedonia.
This is a step backwards, it is a slap in the face of a small state that is really making every effort to go along with us and open negotiations.
I would also say, therefore, Mr Swoboda, that the sleight of hand to stop, or postpone, tomorrow's vote again further risks destabilising the government in Macedonia, encouraging as it does the nationalistic forces.
The actual problem is that with Greece we have an allied country that refuses point blank to recognise any kind of minority in its own country.
This is contrary to the Copenhagen criteria, which is embarrassing to the European Union and to the alliance.
I wish Macedonia every strength as it takes the next few steps in spite of Greece.
<D>
(PL) Mr President, the successful completion of the negotiations in the framework of the Doha Round seems increasingly unlikely.
Mr Mandelson's resignation from the post of Trade Commissioner is one reason for this.
The talks will probably only resume after the start of 2010.
The situation is further complicated by the fact that during the next two years elections are due not only in the United States but also in India and in Brazil.
This means that the new negotiations will be conducted by a different group of people.
For the first time, the European Union is not responsible for the breakdown of the talks.
The United States and India are to be blamed for the collapse of the July ministerial talks.
According to the experts, however, the main reason for the breakdown was a lack of progress on services and industry.
Should there be a return to the negotiating table, priority must be given to consideration of how to help the poorest countries.
At the same time, however, we must not disregard our own interests, notably those of the agricultural sector.
Opening up our market unduly would amount to a serious threat to the stability of farm incomes.
Many farms could be bankrupted as a result.
Should that happen, how would we be able to guarantee the European Union's food security?
Failure to reach agreement on trade issues is an example of how difficult it is to reach a compromise on important matters when such a large number of countries with such varied interests are involved in the talks.
Let us hope for a more positive outcome to the international negotiations on combating climate change.
<D>
rapporteur. - Madam President, it was quite interesting listening to all the speeches this morning in Parliament at a time not only when we are living through the toughest financial and economic crisis, but also when the European elections are approaching.
The reports which we have discussed today, and will vote on tomorrow, are not meant to solve the financial crisis, but we hope they will help us avoid making the same mistakes in future, or at least major mistakes, and hopefully they will support a relaunch of the European economy.
When one hears that small enterprises today have to spend 10 times more than big companies in order to comply with EU legislation on reporting requirements, it is normal to wonder why this is so and how we have come to have rules which through their effects may actually kill these small enterprises and why it has taken us so long to change this.
I am glad that Commissioner McCreevy mentioned that company law is probably the toughest in the EU acquis communautaire.
Maybe it is time to change it, certainly not to make it softer, but perhaps to bring it more in line with the current realities we are living through.
If we want to be more efficient, it is better to put our energy into being constructive, and I think it is fair to say that what happened with the package we discussed today is proof of this.
It is proof that we have acted responsibly and we have reached a compromise with the Council and the Commission in order to adopt this package at first reading.
Can we do more?
Certainly, but let us vote on this and work in the right direction.
<D>
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Mr President, most EU citizens agree that the Union must play a larger role on the world stage.
The Council should play a larger role in this regard, but it is often paralysed or inefficient as a result of internal disagreements.
The Commission will hopefully set a good example this coming year, starting in Europe.
In Turkey the negotiations must proceed smoothly and care must be taken to see that they stay on the right track.
There is much work to do in the Balkans: Bosnia needs help to start forming a state and Macedonia needs to prepare for the start of membership negotiations.
In addition, of course, the European Union will hopefully make an important contribution to the rebuilding of Kosovo and with any luck by the end of this year or some time next year a solution will have been found to the question of its status.
We very much want the Commission, however, to continue with the Black Sea initiative it has undertaken.
It is very important for the European Union to strive for regional cooperation around its borders.
What will the Commission do in terms of the Central Asia strategy that was recently approved by the European Council?
In this respect, I also wish to ask if we may expect further development of the energy policy that Parliament requested earlier this year.
This is very important, including with regard to relations with the region I called 'zonet'.
Then there is the European Neighbourhood Policy.
I think that the priority this coming year must be to conclude the negotiations with Ukraine: in this respect we hope - and Parliament will discuss this tomorrow afternoon - that a situation can be created in that country that will allow, over the coming years, for a new type of agreement, a form of association, under which Ukraine can continue the reform process with the new government towards further integration with the European Union.
In that process Moldova must not be forgotten either, as it is in need of a new partnership agreement.
I hope that the Commission will also present proposals on that issue next year.
Naturally we must also look at how to handle a country like Georgia: this is something we will also debate tomorrow afternoon and we would ask the Commission to be proactive in this regard.
Finally, there has been very little progress with Russia so what can we do to move things forward?
We would suggest renewed action after the presidential elections.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, like almost all the previous speakers - only almost all, unfortunately - I am pleased that today, or tomorrow, we will give a mandate to the President of this House to sign the Charter.
Human rights are our European trade mark both within and outside Europe.
Nonetheless, may I advise caution and that we do not get carried away by our emotions and bite off more than we can chew.
With the Charter and the necessary ratification of the Lisbon Treaty, we are establishing the important and classic basic rights and the important social rights on a legally binding basis, which means that they will be binding for the European institutions and the application of Community law.
We are also making it possible to have recourse to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg in respect of these basic rights, albeit under certain very narrowly defined conditions.
However, this does not mean that every citizen will be able to petition the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg immediately, or indeed at all, as some people - swept away by their emotions - have occasionally claimed.
That kind of claim does not serve our interests.
Let us stop making these assertions, which overshoot the mark, and let us feel a sense of gratification at the result that we have achieved.
In the European Union, we have now set an important course - not only in relation to the classic rights but for our social policy too - of which we can in all conscience be proud.
It includes the work/life balance, the prohibition of child labour, health protection for everyone and a high level of environmental and consumer protection.
We should be pleased about that; it is the truth, and there is no need to embellish it.
<D>
in writing. - (SV) We moderates succeeded today in persuading the European Parliament to vote against the proposal to introduce tariffs for goods from countries which have not signed the Kyoto Protocol.
Similarly we persuaded the European Parliament not to endorse the view that the market economy is to blame for the world's environmental problems.
We have therefore voted in favour of the report on trade and climate change.
Trade is not in itself a threat to the environment - on the contrary.
Trade creates the prosperity we need in order to meet future environmental challenges.
It gives us the ability to make more effective use of scarce resources and lifts people out of poverty, which is the root of most of the world's environmental problems.
Openness and trade are also the precondition for technology transfer, which will enable developing countries today to have a better environment more quickly than we could ourselves.
Transport which does not bear its environmental costs, on the other hand, is a major problem.
We moderates consider that Parliament is adopting the wrong approach in today's vote in promoting proposals to block and limit trade.
Parliament should instead focus on forcing transport to bear its environmental costs.
The concern we all share for the environment must not become a pretext for protectionism, because protectionism is a threat to development and hence a threat to a good environment.
<D>
The Council has always reiterated the prospect of the Western Balkans joining Europe.
This has undoubtedly been as part of foreign policy, in this case, Neighbourhood Policy, and even the enlargement policy of the European Union.
Hence, recently, the Council meeting in December 2009 confirmed the need to respect certain fair conditions, in the context of the stabilisation and association process for the Balkans.
With respect to Kosovo, the Council has already observed that, in this case, the Member States were deciding in accordance with national practice and international law.
As you are aware, the Kosovo unilateral declaration of independence is currently subject to court proceedings in the International Court of Justice.
In any case, however, the Council has always taken Kosovo into account in its political relations with the Balkans and there has been a consensus between Member States and governments in this respect, for example, in terms of the liberalisation of visas, which Kosovo should benefit from, as the Council has always understood.
In addition, the Commission's Communication regarding the means to reinforce Kosovo's political and socio-economic development has been welcomed.
The Council invited the Commission to take the necessary measures to support Kosovo's progress towards the European Union in accordance with the European perspective on the region, to which I previously referred.
The Council encouraged the Commission, and this was done with a consensus, of course, to initiate Kosovo's participation in the European Union's programmes, incorporating Kosovo into economic and fiscal supervision, setting in motion the second component of pre-accession help and reinforcing the stabilisation and association process dialogue.
These conclusions were endorsed by the last European Council on 10 and 11 December 2009.
<D>
I did not wish to support this report insofar as an increase from 14 to 20 weeks on full pay would have catastrophic financial consequences for several Member States.
The OECD study shows that there will be very substantial costs for the social budgets of Member States.
For France, the annual amount is EUR 1.3 billion, and for the United Kingdom GBP 2.4 billion.
In the current economic situation, increases in these budgets cannot be absorbed.
What is more, businesses would have to bear these additional costs, which is impossible.
However, supporting women during maternity is essential.
Applying these measures poses a very great risk to the employment of women.
The OECD study also shows that extending maternity leave would result in a decrease in female employment.
In wishing to help women, there is a risk of penalising them in the job market.
I wish to help women in their employment and to support them during maternity.
The increase from 14 to 18 weeks proposed by the Commission was a real step forward.
Another advance would have been to have progressive measures concerning childcare methods.
<D>
author. - (CS) First of all, I would like to take this opportunity, as the Chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, to congratulate the Commissioner, who was nominated and appointed to the Commission today.
Although serious reasons prevented me from listening to her presentation in person, I must say that she made an excellent impression on the members of my committee and was unanimously welcomed in her new capacity.
Regarding the oral question, I would like to begin by explaining what made us tackle this issue and ask individual states to pay more attention to this serious diagnosis.
You probably know, from the emphasis in the report and in the question, that cancer cases in Europe are on the increase.
There are a number of reasons for this: as we know, the population is ageing and more and more people are exposed to carcinogens.
According to the trade unions, at least 8% of annual cancer deaths are directly caused by exposure to carcinogens in the workplace.
We have to bear in mind that one in three Europeans is diagnosed with cancer during their lifetime and one in four Europeans dies from the disease.
Another important matter is the significant differences in cancer treatment success rates between the old and new Member States.
This imbalance is surely also food for thought.
What can we do in this area and what can we recommend to the European Community?
A structure such as the EU undoubtedly has the capacity and power to coordinate individual national policies.
By adopting national cancer control programmes we can reduce cancer mortality by as much as 30%.
We know that only 3% of the total budget in developed countries is spent on cancer prevention, compared with 97% on treatment.
I would also like to take this opportunity to make an appeal on behalf of patients, who become the focus of our treatment and should become the focus of our care: they should have better access to new scientific knowledge and new information.
The European Union should push ahead with a single register and, as far as possible, common education.
Paradoxically, the European Union has not yet introduced in all its Member States as undeniably important a topic as oncology.
Although oncology is an interdisciplinary subject, its recognition as a subject in its own right is a necessary condition if we want to successfully fight this disease.
Since I would like to allow my colleague from the PPE-DE Group, Professor Trakatellis, to use some of my speaking time, I will now conclude my introduction.
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we cannot ignore the reality of feminicide in Central America.
In many regions of the world, women make an essential contribution to the most worthy societal structures of humanity.
Thanks to their feminine intuition, women enrich our understanding of the world.
They help to make human relations between people more honest and authentic.
The time has come to condemn and severely punish all forms of violence perpetrated against women, not only in Central America but also in several countries of Europe.
In this regard, the participation of women in managing material aid and assistance given to the victims of this violence could be of fundamental importance.
Ladies and gentlemen, if the EU Member States can bring their experience to resolving problems, we should not withhold our expertise.
That is why I remain convinced that bilateral cooperation between the Member States and the states of Central America can be effective.
I bear witness here to a frankly sensitive job within the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality.
I thank the rapporteur, Mr Romeva, for his political sense and cooperation.
We have tabled some amendments by common agreement.
If these amendments are adopted, we can take pride in a job that may improve the situation of women and thus of the whole of Central American society.
<D>
(RO) This report refers to the environmental issues, but it cannot and could not have referred only to environmental issues.
First of all, I would like to emphasize that we shall support this project that may improve Europe's energy supply.
For this reason, I consider it deplorable that the European Union has not developed a common energy policy yet.
The European Union requires common environmental standards and not only when speaking about projects of the Nordstream size.
There are similar projects planned in other parts of Europe and these standards to be agreed should be implemented everywhere.
Nordstream will be an important precedent and we should make sure that we are going in the right direction.
This report is the European Parliament's answer to a petition with more than thirty thousand signatures and we have no right to ignore the European citizens' opinion.
The history of human development, especially in the industrial era, has left true environmental catastrophes behind.
We, the European Parliament, in the Europe of 2008, are not allowed to repeat this history.
<D>
(PL) Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent approach to the issue of environmental protection.
I would also remind you that we have known since the UN report entitled 'Our Common Future', which was prepared by Margot Wallström, that it is our responsibility to future generations, to our children and grandchildren, to leave the natural environment in the best possible condition.
The involvement of the European Union in this area is already very good, but the European Parliament is also keeping its finger on the pulse.
We have a special temporary Committee on Climate Change, we have good legislation, and we enact regulations, directives and decisions.
Now the time has come to strengthen other mechanisms, especially financial incentives and taxes, and also to step up information campaigns and preventive measures.
For these actions to be effective, there has to be a Community approach.
Member States have to overcome their reluctance and their resistance to tax harmonisation, at least as far as the environment is concerned.
Even though they are used for sensible purposes, ecological taxes are not at all popular at present.
Just like all taxes, they are disliked.
For this reason we have to make all possible efforts at European and national levels to make ecological payments and taxes socially acceptable.
What we need are activities that inspire a high level of ecological awareness.
We need incentives that will ensure that good practices are used widely and will promote pro-ecological social behaviour.
After all, no one complains when, in the European Parliament shop, we are asked to pay five cents for a plastic bag.
This is of fundamental importance - not the financial dimension of this action, but the moment of reflection that accompanies it, when the customer thinks whether to take the plastic bag, or to leave it and reduce the amount of rubbish on the planet.
This is a good way to make people think.
People will accept financial charges, taxes and other environmental levies, but only when they believe they are sensible and can see a positive outcome.
<D>
on behalf of the S&D Group. - Mr President, the situation for our group is very clear.
We heard on the one hand from the Council that, if a European Arrest Warrant is executed properly and effectively and not in the many trivial cases we have seen, its advantages outweigh those disadvantages.
The Commissioner set out what is a credible report - a serious report - which tells us that if we can deal with trivial cases and disproportionality and with the procedural guarantees, then the European Arrest Warrant can still be a valuable way of catching serious, organised criminals.
We should not forget the 12 000 figure - I feel very strongly about the fact that in my constituency of London, we caught the attempted bombers of July 2005.
When we understand the serious and symbolic effect of these cases, the European Arrest Warrant can and should work.
The oral question we have today for our group is very simple.
We are now in the area of moving from the reports to the action, and we have a situation where we have two hard cases.
One is the lack of proportionality.
This will not be solved overnight, and I commend the Commissioner (I am talking about judicial training) for ensuring that we fix the issue of trivial cases dominating and creating a credibility problem for the European Arrest Warrant.
But that also requires the Council (I am not referring just to Hungary, I am talking about the Member States) to help us in pushing forward the procedural guarantees, and the issue of unacceptable pre-trial detention periods for many citizens in my own country.
These are the situations which create the problems for a tool which could be effective if used properly.
But the hardest case is going to be creating an even playing field in relation to procedural defence rights.
This is why within my group, which has [called for] the letter of rights, we take seriously both the quality and speed of the legislation which we need to ensure that the European Arrest Warrant can be the effective tool that it should be for catching serious, organised criminals, and that its credibility must not be diminished by the many trivial cases and uneven playing field that we currently see.
This is the position we want to see for our group, and we believe the commitment is here.
But we must pay close attention, particularly to the Member States when they ask for the European Arrest Warrant to be effective, but, on the other hand, do not carry out the actions to help us get the legislation to create that even playing field.
(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))
<D>
(PT) The changes taking place in Latin America should encourage the European Union to establish new cooperation relations with the countries of Latin America.
Greater attention should be paid to social and cultural aspects and to support for development in a framework of mutual respect for the different levels of development and different political choices of the people.
Unfortunately, these are minor aspects in the proposals put forward by the European Union.
Generally speaking, their main interest is economic, aimed at safeguarding the business of large European economic and financial groups.
This situation has been highlighted by social organisations, particularly in Brazil, as we discovered during the last trip to Brazil by the Delegation for relations with Mercosur.
At a time when, for example, most of the population in Mexico is suffering from the consequences of the serious economic recession and when the overwhelming majority of the Mexican banking sector is controlled by foreign companies, particularly European banks, it is regrettable that the European Union is still using its agreement with Mexico more as a point of entry to the United States than to support local development.
As a result, it is contributing to the destruction of Mexico's small and medium-sized enterprises and its productive fabric, particularly the industrial fabric, due to the insistence on free trade, liberalisation of strategic sectors and commercialisation of essential goods such as water.
We therefore need to radically overhaul the EU's policies on partnership agreements, so as to give priority to cooperation and to economic and social development.
In this way we can help to create jobs with rights, ensure social progress, promote the rights of indigenous peoples, defend the forests and biodiversity, and also recognise the sovereign right of Latin American countries to high-quality public services, control of strategic sectors within their economies and respect for the decisions of the institutions chosen by their people.
<D>
Mr President, I would ask that my initial words are not taken into account by the infernal time machine as they are intended to add to the message of condolence conveyed by this House to Mrs Klamt and, in particular, to congratulate the rapporteurs.
I will now start.
I congratulate the rapporteurs because, with these two proposals, we are taking a qualitative step towards a common immigration policy and we are promoting legal migration which is a key element of our global approach.
The common set of rights and the single residence and work permit for legal migrants must be extended to the highest possible number of workers.
As a result, we socialists ask that no category of workers is excluded.
The 'Blue Card' offers an opportunity for migrants to settle with their families and work in our countries.
It opens a single door to 27 labour markets.
However, it cannot be solely highly qualified workers who enter through this door.
Commissioner, we therefore expect the Commission to shortly present its proposals on other labour categories.
Ladies and gentlemen, we must avoid a brain drain.
This Blue Card must not become a passport encouraging vital human resources to leave developing countries.
For every qualified professional who comes to Europe, the PSE Group wants us to fund the training of a new professional in the country of origin.
Finally, Europe must be an attractive destination, not only for talent coming from outside the Union, but also for our own European talent.
In 2007, nearly 300 000 highly qualified Europeans left to work outside the Union.
We must do everything we can to keep them in the European house.
<D>
- (FR) Mr President-in-Office of the Council and of the French Republic, we debate the palliative care to be given to the ill, but we are very discreet about the causes of the illness.
How is it that no EU institutions saw the current crisis coming?
Not the Council, not the Commission, not the Central Bank, not even, ladies and gentlemen, our Parliament, or any of the Member States' governments.
The crisis was predicted, it is true, by a mere handful of economists, such as the Nobel Prize winner, Maurice Allais, and political officials, for the most part from our family of beliefs, including, once again, Jean-Marie Le Pen.
Unfortunately, it is a case of 'the voice of one crying in the wilderness'.
The crisis is, however, clearly that of the Euro-internationalist system, uncontrolled free trade, and the terrifying separation between financial fiction and the realities of our declining economies and industries, which could in future be the target of sovereign funds of third countries benefiting from the current situation.
Even your work, Mr Sarkozy, testifies to the maladjustment of the Union: a meeting of 4, not of 27, on Saturday 4 October; a bilateral meeting with Germany only on 11 October; a meeting of only 15 of the Eurogroup's members; a meeting with the US President to convince him to organise yet another meeting theoretically designed to radically reform the entire system, to which were invited, if we have correctly understood, only 6 of the 27 EU Member States, the United States, Japan, Russia, India and China.
I am not prejudging the usefulness of those meetings.
I am saying that this is a return to bilateral or multilateral diplomacy, and it clearly demonstrates that, given its failure to react, its entanglement in bureaucratic rules and its compulsive desire for powers that it is incapable of exercising, the Union as a framework has had its day.
The European Council's report attests to this if one reads between the lines.
It ratifies your initiatives, it begs the Central Bank in a roundabout manner to loosen ever so slightly the stranglehold of the Maastricht criteria, but it does not decide a thing.
You mentioned the situation in Georgia and your efforts, but how can you not see that unilateral recognition of Kosovo's independence paved the way for the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia?
How can you justify the indefinite extension of NATO when the Warsaw Pact has itself disappeared?
Mr Sarkozy, the path to be followed lies elsewhere.
It involves a radical break with the internationalist system and the complete calling into question of the so-called benefits of the universal mixing of people, goods and capital.
Unequivocally defending our independence and our identities does not mean isolating ourselves; rather, it is a prerequisite for regaining our influence in the world.
<D>
(PL) Mr President, the Council representative called for a more social Europe.
I would respond to the Minister with a call for more common sense.
That would be better.
The European Union can of course propose a great deal, but it must be stressed that social policy is an area in which Member States have sovereign powers of decision.
In short, what we need is less rhetoric and more concrete action.
The European Union is proposing as many as 19 interesting initiatives, of which only three are legislative proposals.
What is perhaps the most important proposal, that on cross-border health care, will not be discussed today.
That is very regrettable, and it is a pity that the discussion will have to wait until the French Minister of Health shows up at our sitting.
In conclusion, it must be stressed that EU Member States allocate as much as 27% of their GNP to social policy, compared to 15% in the USA.
The question is whether the money is well spent.
<D>
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is right that the capture and harmonisation of statistics on the most important economic and social characteristics of the regions is essential for the European Union.
The allocation of structural funds, one third of the budget, actually relies on this base data.
What the Commission is proposing here in its regulation on population censuses, however, in reality has nothing to do with these necessities.
The data that it wants to capture and harmonise in this statutory text, which directly applies to all EU Member States, is personal data on our fellow human beings, which is not really of any concern to the EU.
Included in this are personal data on family and sex life, housing situation and religious affiliation.
Furthermore, it also has the audacity to want to include this data by law in uniform standards without including any reference in the law to data protection.
It is therefore our duty as representatives of our citizens to stop any such intrusion into individual rights, particularly as there is no reason to harmonise data on family life, personal circumstances or the housing situation when this does not in any way fall within the competence of the European Union and is not provided for in the Reform Treaty.
The EU cannot be allowed, through the back door, to claim competences here that should remain solely with the Member States, and the supervision of data collection would presume this.
For us it is not a question of time or speed, but a question of the prime necessity that the protection of personal data has absolute priority.
This Commission text does not guarantee this.
I am happy that the rapporteur wants to delete the non-mandatory text here.
We already backed this, even at committee level.
Unfortunately, she had not obtained a majority for it at that time.
The citizens expect us to ensure that what the judgment now stipulates, namely adjournment, will actually compel the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs to make sure that data protection is checked here once again and that only then will the decision on Parliament's position and first reading be made.
I would ask all groups to be true to their word here.
<D>
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (SV) First of all, our thoughts go out to the sons, brothers and loved ones who are now missing following the brutal attack on the AMIS force.
These people died trying to help their fellow humans in a neighbouring country.
Many have been affected by violence, rape, murder and extreme poverty here.
How many times have we stood here and talked about it?
How many times have we demanded that the government or others take action?
Let me remind you that the central task of any government is to protect the human rights of its civilian population.
This government has never attempted or tried to do this in its entire career.
However, we must still be patient in our frustration, as it is only through long-term economic and political support for those who are endeavouring to resolve the conflict that we can do it.
We must not altogether ignore our own economic interests.
Sometimes it is our own oil companies that are actually supporting certain groups, indirectly or directly.
We must address this too.
A heavy responsibility rests with the government, and we must make further demands.
I agree completely with my colleague Raül Romeva that the International Criminal Court must be given full access rights and a full right to investigate, so that the people in this stricken country can see justice in due course.
Thank you.
<D>
(SV) Mr President, this issue is about the right of the individual to seek healthcare where good care is available.
The representative of the Group of the European United Left, Eva-Britt Svensson, said here earlier today that it will lead to healthcare tourism.
I would like to inform her that, when sick people seek care, it is because they are in pain, they are suffering, they are damaged, and they need care.
It is not about tourism.
Ultimately, this question is about the power of bureaucracy versus the right of the individual.
It is about whether old frontiers should be used as a barrier to people seeking healthcare or whether the openness of today's Europe should be used as a means for people throughout Europe to get the best healthcare they can.
It was illuminating to hear what the Group of the Left thinks but, since I have the representative of the Social Democrats, Jan Andersson, in front of me and he is right after me on the speakers' list, it would be interesting to hear from him whether he shares Eva-Britt Svensson's view that sick people who seek care abroad are engaging in healthcare tourism.
Does he, like her, want to erect barriers of various kinds or will you, will the Social Democrats, work to ensure that we have the greatest possible openness, in which patients do not need to ask permission from the authorities to get healthcare?
This question, Jan Andersson, is about Social Europe.
It is not about how individual decision-makers should determine what others can do, but how the individual can get the best healthcare.
Over to you, Jan Andersson.
<D>
in writing. - (PL) I supported Mr Konrad Szymanowski's report on the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument.
It is a worthwhile EU initiative, aimed at fostering cooperation between the EU and partner states.
This cooperation includes, amongst others, efforts to promote dialogue and reform, environmental protection and action in the field of energy security.
It also includes efforts to reduce poverty, promote equality between women and men, promote employment and social protection, foster cross-border cooperation, promote health, education and human rights, combat terrorism and organised crime, and promote cooperation in the scientific, educational, innovation and cultural spheres.
It is therefore essential to conduct a substantive and financial review of all ENPI Operational Programmes, taking into account the countries, the regions and the issues involved.
These activities should expand the free trade zone.
It is important to note that the Eastern Partnership should not hinder neighbouring countries wishing to apply for membership of the EU.
The section which mentions the EUR 500 billion allocated to Georgia between 2008-2010 for reconstruction work and aid to refugees, following the depredations of war, is also worthy of support.
I also accept that it is advisable to review our cooperation with Belarus, along with the level of funding allocated to that country, in order to ascertain whether the policy of re-engagement with that country, initiated in September 2008, should be continued.
Furthermore, I agree that we need to guarantee that any financial assistance granted to Russia contributes to strengthening democratic standards in that country.
<D>
Mr President, 10 years of the euro is indeed a reason to celebrate.
Anyone who had said 10 years ago that the euro would have developed as splendidly as it has done would have been laughed at.
Many people have contributed to this success, and I remember many sceptical voices - it was referred to as a premature baby and an unviable project - and today we know that it was a vision to which many people contributed.
The previous speaker reminded us of all those who contributed to this, of the milestones, of the European monetary system, which was an agreement with the European Central Bank to create central rates, of the Delors report, which provided for the introduction of the monetary union in three stages, of the Treaty of Maastricht - only two years after the fall of the Wall - and of the transitional periods.
Many people have helped to make the euro the successful project it is today.
As the committee chairman, Mrs Berès, has already said, during this period, in particular from 1994 when the implementation of the Treaty of Maastricht began, and up to 2002, Parliament actively cooperated in the introduction of the notes and coins, and in many reports, discussions, opinions and also proposals, and I would like specifically to thank the two committee chairmen from that time, Mr von Wogau and Mrs Randzio-Plath, who also represented Parliament to the outside world and who gave this project, although originally created by the governments, the parliamentary support it needed.
We are working today, too, under the chairmanship of Mrs Berès, for the same representation.
On 18 November Parliament adopted, with a large majority, a report in which we describe the successes, challenges, risks and problems, and I would like to mention just a few things in addition to what Mrs Berès has said.
The euro has been a great success, and it is a unique project: a central monetary policy under the management of the European Central Bank and local budgetary and finance policies.
It is important that, in future, the connection between these two levels of responsibility in the Stability and Growth Pact are retained also during times of crisis.
Without this Stability and Growth Pact, without stronger coordination of the budgetary and finance policy, the euro would also in future face risks that are avoidable.
In this regard, I appeal in particular to the Member States of the euro area, but also to the whole of the European Union, to take this discipline, this coordinated cooperation, more seriously than has been the case in the past in connection with certain issues.
The euro has pushed down inflation considerably and so created confidence and stability, and it has become the second most commonly held reserve currency in a space of time that no one thought it capable of.
The euro has increased the pressure for structural reform in the Member States and therefore, even in the age of globalisation, has become a 'fitness programme' for undertakings and for nations.
The institutions of the euro area - several were mentioned by the previous speaker - the Ecofin Council, the Euro Group and many other institutions have created the necessary conditions together with the Commission and the European Central Bank, because they were already operating, because they were in place, because they worked independently in order to react quickly, reliably and correctly in the economic crisis.
We have experienced the euro as a lever for creating a European financial market.
The political conclusion from these common successes is that states with a common currency and a common internal market have achieved a unique level of integration that will secure peace and prosperity.
However, we cannot necessarily take the euro for granted in future.
There are numerous specific requests and demands to take the risks seriously: the drifting apart of the national economies, which is associated with considerable risks in connection with the growth of wages and with budget deficits, should not be concealed on this anniversary.
An entirely different aspect is the varying development of the interest rates for government bonds.
We are currently seeing the interest rate margin, which has no doubt decreased, increasing again, bringing the possibility of new problems in this regard for individual Member States within the euro area.
I would remind the House that, particularly in connection with the expansion of the euro area, no special rebates may be given and that all states that are members of the euro area can, and must, comply with these conditions of the Treaty of Maastricht.
The euro has been well-received by the public.
It has gained the world's trust.
It has passed the first test and has provided a unique contribution to the permanent integration of our nations in Europe.
That is something we can all be proud of.
Thank you.
(Applause)
<D>
Gross revenues from gambling on the internet amounted to EUR 2-3 billion in 2004.
According to the aforementioned SICL study it now accounts for almost 5% of the total gambling market in the EU.
A rapid growth in these services in the future is unavoidable and we therefore need clear and transparent rules.
The report by Mrs Schaldemose considers a different approach to the gambling industry in Europe and therefore I cannot support it.
It makes no distinction between gambling operators that are licensed and operating in accordance with the law and those operating often without a license and unlawfully.
It is necessary to start from the fact that most European states have a gambling industry.
I agree that individual Member States should continue to determine the rules for internet gambling.
As long as there is no applicable evidence of threats to players, money laundering or corruption in sport we should not regard all of the companies as criminals.
There are also serious firms who use the best technology and operate in accordance with the law.
I am not a supporter but rather an opponent of internet gambling.
However, in my view a general ban would lead to the growth and illegality of these activities and a total absence of rules.
I believe that the position I have drafted with my colleagues represents a fairer and clearer alternative to the rapporteur's report.
<D>
(EL) Mr President, terrorism as an act is to be condemned by all Members present in this House.
However, this should not lead us to make protecting our true security difficult.
In reality, the choices made by the EU to stamp out these hideous crimes leave us divided and deeply uncertain.
Adopting increasingly reactionary measures confirms that we were right to disagree from the outset with the ethos of the whole enterprise, and that we are right to be concerned now about substantial protection for our citizens' freedoms.
The reform proposals presented call for an even heavier investment in measures and policies that can put innocent people in the dock and bring about their conviction.
On the basis of suspicion alone, they overturn the fundamental legal principle of presumed innocence.
How can public incitement or provocation constitute a crime when it does not have any consequence or lead to any action?
How far-fetched can the definition of provocation be?
When can it be considered public?
When is it genuinely dangerous and therefore punishable?
The declaratory nature of some of the provisions on the protection of freedom of expression is not enough: what determines the implementation of the proposal is the thinking behind its definitions.
These contravene Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights and may lead to the criminalisation of demonstrations, speeches, etc.
In our view, the EU is once again making a choice based on political expediency rather than attempting to protect citizens' real freedoms.
It is trying to dispel our worries with declarative clauses that are unable to guarantee the protection of those who some wish to see as potential terrorists.
<D>
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first may I thank the shadow rapporteurs, especially Mr Sánchez Presedo on behalf of the socialists and Mrs Bowles on behalf of the liberals, who worked very successfully with me on the compromise text being tabled today as a report on the Commission's White Paper.
We have managed this time to achieve a very large, cross-group majority and a really viable compromise, which can also be used as a guideline for future work by the European Commission and later, during the law-making process, by Parliament and the Council.
We have made clear in this report - and rightly so - that, where competition rules are infringed, Parliament stands by the view that, according to the European tradition, it is primarily the task of the authorities - both the national competition authorities and the European competition authority - to take action and that this is not creating a second arm, as it were, on an equal footing with official action in the fight against cartels.
We have deliberately chosen a different path in Europe from the US, with which the situation is often compared.
There is political consensus in the House that we need a solution for so-called mass claims.
If the illegal conduct of individuals damages a very large number of persons who suffer comparatively minor losses, then a separate solution is needed for such proceedings, for which normal procedural law is simply not effective enough.
The creation of such an instrument is also part of providing access to law and further developing the internal market.
On this we are agreed.
There was also consensus that we do not want a litigation industry to develop in Europe as it has in America, with turnover of USD 240 billion, which is ultimately of no advantage to consumers and, as we all know from simply reading the relevant books, mainly profits American law firms.
None of this has much to do with the rule of law, nor do we want it to.
We agreed that the procedural torture instruments of the American system should not be adopted in Europe.
This applies in particular to the taking of evidence and costs.
That is a very important point.
We also agreed that we were basically of the opinion that, from a point of view of principle, legislation at European level can only be an opt-in solution and that an opt-out solution would only be permissible here where the Member States already have a similar solution and national constitutional law so allows.
An opt in is not allowed under every country's national constitutional law and it also contradicts the principle of the adult consumer.
As we insistently complain, the European Commission has completely forgotten to deal with the question of out-of-court settlements in its White Paper.
The Directorate-General on Competition and the Commission have gone straight for litigation.
However, as we have known for years from the debate in this House on legal policy, that is not always the ideal way forward and, as a rule, out-of-court settlement mechanisms are often much more suitable for resolving problems.
Moreover, parallel work by the Directorate-General on Consumer Protection on the same issue has progressed much further.
This Directorate-General used a broad margin for these alternative settlement instruments in its Green Paper, which is one consultation stage before this.
We are convinced that the European Commission urgently needs to rework this question.
One last point, which is also crucial: we do not want fragmentation of the law.
Now competition law is going off and creating such an instrument.
Consumer protection is coming along on the same issue.
We know that at some point something similar will be considered in relation to capital market law, environmental law and social law.
We consider it absolutely necessary for a horizontal approach to be considered as well and for us at least to support the procedural instruments which are more or less the same in all areas with a horizontal instrument.
That is also of decisive importance.
<D>
rapporteur. - (PT) I should like to thank everyone for their kind words.
I must particularly thank my friend, Minister Lenarčič, who I worked with on the Security Council some years ago, dealing precisely with Iraq and the problems caused for Iraq by Saddam Hussein.
As I have said, this report aims to highlight the diversity of the situations existing in Iraq, contrary to the simplistic message of an Iraq of 'fire and sword' that television programmes show us every day.
It must be viewed as a plan of action or a roadmap for the EU's involvement in Iraq.
I believe that I am speaking on behalf of Parliament when I say that we want the Commission, the Council and the Member States to use our operational proposals as a basis when designing future programmes and projects to support the government and people of Iraq, naturally taking into account the security conditions.
I returned from Iraq impressed with the Iraqi enthusiasm for 'more Europe'.
From President Talabani to the primary school teacher in one of the most isolated rural areas in the country, everyone had a thirst for political recognition and institutional support from the European Union.
We were bombarded with proposals for projects in the most diverse areas: training of officials at the Interior Ministry, support for local NGOs active in the areas of mine clearance, adult literacy, and sexual and reproductive health education, technical and institutional support for the Iraqi Parliament, and these are only some of the examples.
I feel that we must measure the success of this report, not so much in terms of the number of votes in tomorrow's vote, but primarily by the difference that it will make to our actions on the ground in Iraq from now on.
Our parliamentary delegation to Iraq will of course play its part in this process and I am sure that we can count on the Commission, on Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, whom I congratulate, and on her courageous team in Baghdad, competently led by Ambassador Uusitalo, as fundamental allies in the implementation of this roadmap.
<D>
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. - (BG) I would like to congratulate Mr Gaubert on his report on the Council Directive on a single permit for third-country nationals to reside and work in the territory of the European Union.
I was draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs regarding this directive.
As an MEP for Bulgaria, one of the ten Member States which have been subjected to transitional periods, I am strongly opposed to restrictions on free access to the labour market for a considerable part of the European workforce.
For this reason, I welcome the efforts by European institutions to secure equal treatment for everybody who resides and legally works in the European Union.
The purpose of this directive is to act as a horizontal tool, bearing in mind that particular directives are already in effect or are to be adopted.
I have in mind the Directives on seasonal workers, workers who are long-term residents and 'EU Blue Cards' which we are discussing today.
While formulating our stance, I had the support of colleagues from our parliamentary commission and believe that the texts we have proposed set the rights of third-country workers in a balanced way.
I would like to mention here the right to education, the recognition of degrees and certificates, working conditions, access to social security, tax rebates and others.
This directive provides a minimum, general selection of rights to third-country workers in relation to work.
Consequently, the rights given to them should therefore not exceed the rights guaranteed under particular directives.
Namely, it is for this reason that the European Commission's proposal envisages particular conditions for exercising these rights.
In the final version of the stance, which was put to the vote by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, these conditions are, however, lacking.
This has put us in a situation where there are blatant discrepancies such as with the 'EU Blue Card' as well as with that guaranteed under other particular directives, including the Directive concerning third-country nationals who are long-term residents of the EU.
Ladies and gentlemen, at this time of financial and economic crisis, it is necessary that we be realistic.
As rapporteur for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I appeal to you that we take a responsible outlook and vote for a logically sound and consistent document.
<D>
Mr President, this resolution recalls the horrors of Fascism and of Soviet Communism.
No European, no child of Western civilisation, no civilised human being could disagree.
But it then goes on to posit the European Union as an alternative or antidote to such totalitarianism.
It reads: 'the European Union has a particular responsibility to promote and safeguard democracy, both inside and outside the European Union'.
It is here, my friends, that you make your bloomer.
The European Union is not safeguarding democracy, either internally or externally.
Abroad it is doing business with Castro's Cuba, with the Ayatollahs in Tehran; it is demanding the right to sell arms to Communist China.
At home it is striking down referendum results when they go against closer integration.
Now of course, one has to be careful making such parallels.
No one is arguing that the European Union is a Soviet system that takes away people's passports or runs Gulags or operates show trials.
But it should deeply worry us when any system claims that the ruling ideology is too important to be subjected to the ballot box.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I thank the honourable Members for their contributions and I will deal with some of the points raised by them.
Mrs Oviir and Mrs Grossetête said that the white paper was too general.
But the aim of the white paper is to set up a number of general principles and objectives to guide Community health action for the years to come.
It would be very difficult to set quantifiable targets on such broad and general objectives and on such a wide range of issues.
The Commission does fully agree that quantifiable targets are a good means to drive change and to achieve results.
We feel, however, that it is better to consider such targets within each individual policy initiative in the framework of the strategy.
A number of speakers referred to inequalities in health, for example Mr Janowski, Mr Adamou, Mrs Belohorská, Mrs Doyle, Mr Kuźmiuk and Mrs Westlund.
We fully agree with the concerns raised and with the need to help to bridge the health gap.
The Commission will be presenting a communication next year but, in the mean time, we will help to channel structural funds for health.
Mrs Willmott asked a number of questions.
She made the point that there are too many work streams in health.
But this is the reason why the EU health strategy adopted in 2007 aims to bring together, under a coherent framework, all policies that impact on health.
The Commission is looking at the different structures in the health sector to achieve synergies between structures and to ensure that work is done in an efficient and an effective manner without duplication.
Mrs Willmott also asked about the Carcinogens Directive.
The Commission has consulted the social partners on the possible revision of the 2004 directive in this area and is currently commissioning a study to be concluded in early 2010 on the options for amending this directive.
The results of this study will enable the Commission to decide on an appropriate way forward.
EU legislation on health and safety at work, specifically the 1998 directive on all chemical agents, already covers protection at work against all chemicals, including those with a toxic effect on reproduction.
Mrs Westlund raised the issue of antibiotic resistance.
The Commission is working closely with the ECDC.
The ECDC work plan for 2008 includes antimicrobial resistance among its priority actions.
In addition it plans to organise, on an annual basis, an EU Antibiotic Awareness Day.
This event is aimed at strengthening public perception and knowledge of issues relating to all antimicrobial resistance.
The first Awareness Day will take place on 18 November 2008.
We are also collaborating closely with the ECDC on the preparation of a second report on Member States' implementation of the Council recommendation of 2002.
In conclusion I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Peterle, and all Members for their support for the health strategy that we have developed.
<D>
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Madam President, Commissioner, I am grateful to the rapporteur for his text.
For once, I would echo many of the comments made by Mrs Kauppi.
We began working on this text back in the spring and I think that those of us who considered it very timely have been proved right by the events of the summer.
What happened this summer raises questions about deposit-guarantee schemes.
We simply cannot live with a system where many of the market players operate across a number of countries without deposit-guarantee arrangements that are at least harmonised or based on common principles, in the interests not only of competition by also of public confidence in market mechanisms.
I was very struck as I travelled around during the summer - and not just in the Scandinavian countries - at how this question of deposit-guarantee systems was raised systematically and was considered crucially important.
I know, of course, what the Commissioner will say: 'If you were to put together all the European-level guarantee schemes, the total would still be no more than a drop in the ocean by comparison with the sums needed to tackle the crises.'
That is a poor argument when we need to reduce our handicap in terms of both competitiveness and confidence in market mechanisms, particularly because it has the effect of distorting business strategies, as companies suddenly find themselves forced to arbitrate, for the wrong reasons, between their various subsidiaries and branches.
On the basis of all these arguments, I asked my group to support me.
The group tabled an amendment calling on the Commission to work faster and to recognise what people expect of it: while they may not express their demand loud and specifically, in terms of a priority, they do need reassurance about how Europe's financial markets work and how accurately they respond to events.
A sound, European-level deposit-guarantee system is bound to make a contribution in this respect.
Commissioner, I believe it is part of your task to assess the level of confidence or otherwise in the functioning of the financial markets at European level.
It is hardly enough, I think, to sit back and await fresh research results.
You need to take action to accelerate the response and enable us to progress on a more harmonised basis, with a better and more transparent understanding of deposit-guarantee schemes and how they operate in the European Union.
<D>
in writing. - (DE) The EU's enlargement on 1 May 2004 has increased the economic and social disparities within the EU.
In January this year, a new programming period for cohesion policy began.
This will focus on new priorities and objectives: environmental protection, competitiveness, and the creation of more and better jobs.
The EU's cohesion policy is intended, through its four separate programmes, to help make Europe and its regions more competitive, for example through innovation, the development of the knowledge society, and strengthening economic competitiveness.
It is also intended to increase the attractiveness of the regions for investors and residents through sustainable regional development.
Better and above all more jobs are to be created, and the regions developed further in order to promote opportunities and reduce disparities.
With its further enlargement, EU funding now has to be divided among 27 Member States.
The money must therefore be used better, more efficiently and transparently.
As regards the financial framework, the European Council has made EUR 307.6 billion available for the period 2007-2013.
This is a great deal of money.
It is important that regions with development problems in the wealthy Member States such as Austria also have a fair share of the funds.
Mountain regions in particular require further support.
<D>
in writing. - (LT) In essence this Directive does not change the current regulation system, but improves it and makes it stricter.
I completely agree with the rapporteur that in the discussion of this legal act most attention was concentrated on:
the matter of the use of carcinogenic, chemical and fragrant substances in toys,
toy safety evaluation procedures, requirements for special warnings,
the area of application of the Directive, its flexibility and relationship with other Community acts.
The complete prohibition of carcinogenic, mutagenic, toxic, allergenic and fragrant substances should be evaluated from the view of the Directive's practical implementation.
It may be difficult or very expensive to remove the natural residues of certain harmful substances found in other materials, therefore, it is difficult to implement practically.
On the other hand some sort of categorical rule banning all substances which are carcinogenic, allergenic, etc, will be difficult to implement for the simple reason that a finite list of such substances does not and cannot exist, it is very difficult to draw a clear line between those substances which are harmful and those which are not.
A complete ban on all fragrant substances would be a disproportionate measure and would have a negative impact on certain toy manufacturers.
I am delighted that during the vote the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy showed understanding and did not wield too big a stick when making the requirements of the Directive stricter, as neither business nor consumers themselves would have benefited from this.
When unreasonably strict requirements are laid down, the temptation not to observe them increases, and if they are adhered to, then there are negative side effects.
Let us not forget that the one who pays for everything in the end is usually the consumer.
<D>
rapporteur. - (HU) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Minister Žerjav, Vice-President Barrot, ladies and gentlemen.
The European Parliament has given continuous and positive support to the Galileo programme since its inception.
In November last year, 2007, the European Parliament, in a bold step, moved the programme out of the doldrums and in December approved the financing for the development of the GNSS programmes from a revised Community budget.
We are now discussing a regulation on the implementation of the Galileo and EGNOS GNSS programmes following a successful informal trialogue in the first reading.
Financing, which will be completely from the Community budget, necessitates special responsibility to European taxpayers and the careful regulation that goes with it.
This is particularly true for financing, programme governance, public procurement procedures and security.
We have learned so much in the past few years, being confronted with so many problems.
With regulations, too, we are going down an entirely new road, you could say we are blazing a trail, since this is the first common European infrastructure which is being built up jointly and is under common Community ownership.
Financing - the European Parliament recognises that the development cost of the programme is EUR 3.4 billion, assured by the budgetary authorities.
The Commission will also be asked to submit a proposal by 2010 for post-2013 financing, in particular for common ownership commitments.
Please note that keeping to schedules and avoiding further delay are pivotal in achieving the financial success of the programmes.
Pricing policy will be determined after detailed analysis of the utilisation stage, bearing in mind that consumers will be getting a good quality service.
Management of the programme will be designed for clear shared authority.
The Commission is responsible for programme implementation and programme management and will be aided in its work, in committee procedures, by the Programme Committee.
The European Space Agency (ESA) is the prime contractor, and it is to be noted that the contractual agreement between the Commission and the ESA will be a pledge of the programme's success.
After long debate, the GSA (the European GNSS Supervisory Authority) will oversee programme security.
The European Parliament, the Council and the committee recognise that new forms of cooperation must be found, in order for the programme to succeed.
In future, in line with the declaration in the Annex we will jointly follow the progress of implementation of the programme quarterly, in the Interinstitutional Panel, and the work programme will be reviewed annually.
The regulations on public procurement procedures were an important part of the November rapporteur's report, and the key elements have been incorporated into the Council proposal.
We are in complete agreement with the latter.
With the Galileo programme we have hopes of new technology, development, new business opportunities and work, and we particularly stress the opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises in all 27 Member States.
The regulations provide for this.
Parliament's negotiating delegation, under the chairmanship of Angelika Niebler, ITRE Chairwoman (Committee on Industry, Research and Energy), and with the participation of shadow rapporteurs and representatives of opinion-giving committees, submitted the text approved in the first reading as part of the informal trialogue to the ITRE Committee.
The ITRE Committee approved it unanimously.
We now submit these regulations to the European Parliament in plenary.
Finally, I am grateful to the Slovene Presidency for its commitment to the programme, to the Commission for its expert work, and to my colleagues for their support, which has made agreement possible.
Thank you.
<D>
in writing. - (EL) The group of the Communist Party of Greece in the European Parliament voted against the annual report on the application of the EU common foreign and security policy (CFSP) in 2007.
The report insultingly calls for the international political and military presence of the EU - in other words its imperialist interventions throughout the world - to be strengthened.
It uses problems generated by capitalist development, such as climate change and energy questions, as new pretexts for its imperialist interventionism and to improve its position over its global imperialist competitors.
At the same time, it seeks closer and deeper cooperation with the USA, with a view to taking a joint approach to grassroots reactions and resistance to their imperialist rule.
The report defends the EU's imperialist action in various areas of the world, such as the Western Balkans, where it has already established the EULEX police/judicial force in Kosovo, the Middle East as a whole, Georgia, Africa and elsewhere, and is looking to become even stronger.
Year on year, the EU is becoming more aggressive to and dangerous for the people, who must fight a more decisive and coordinated fight to overturn this policy, together with the US and NATO policy and the imperialist order of things overall.
<D>
In the first few weeks of 2009, EU Member States were treated as hostages by Ukraine, whose leaders initiated a supply settlement dispute with Moscow over the price of gas deliveries.
Kiev based its action on the hope that, as a result of the traditional anti-Russian sentiment in Western and Eastern Europe, it would be able to gain the support of most EU Member States.
Obviously this was a political shot in the foot.
The EU needs to break out of its own vicious circle at last.
Just one part of this is the energy phobia according to which we need to put up with the Russians, or they will turn off the gas tap.
This mistaken standpoint can only lead to erroneous consequences!
This issue involves more than just energy!
If the European Union's long-term goal is partnership with a Russia built on democracy, providing an enormous market which is developing and capable of further development, then it also has to anticipate that the economic and political centres of gravity could legitimately shift to Russia.
The EU must actively and credibly convey the message that it is interested in seeing a modern Russia come into existence.
The EU's behaviour, consisting of encouraging words but stifling, reticent and condemnatory actions is doomed to failure.
The lack of a common energy and foreign policy, squeezing the diversification of energy use into the background and prioritising certain historical injuries and commercial advantages renders our Union vulnerable.
A united EU would give Moscow pause for thought, for it has never before seen such a thing.
In the face of countries engaging in capricious politics, however, an enormous country like Russia can easily assert its will.
This is about much, much more than energy!

on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) The President-in-Office of the Council has talked about our complex historical experiences.
I take the view that the Czech Presidency is an opportunity for us to help overcome the existing division of Europe into West and East.
In his novel Schweik, Jaroslav Hašek once made a pun, a German-Hungarian pun, kelet oszt, nyugat veszti, which loosely translated means that the East gives and the West takes.
Consequently, that is the way history has progressed.
I believe that we have an opportunity to bring an end to this.
I think that the Czech Presidency is also an opportunity for us to liberate ourselves from our own dogmas and prejudices.
I offer, as an example of such dogmas, the recent article by Václav Klaus advising us how to overcome this financial crisis by temporarily softening social, environmental and health standards because, he says, these standards obstruct rational human behaviour.
I would say that the opposite is true, that the Czech Presidency should help to ensure that we have a socially and ecologically driven economy, that is, an economy powered by social and environmental factors.
I would like to note here that I agree with Prime Minister Topolánek on one thing: the need to rely on the flow of innovation to bring us out of the crisis and the need to develop - in the words of Richard Florida, if you will - a creative class that will help our economies escape the impasse.
I mean to say that we all need the courage to change.
Stefan George, the great German writer, says that the future belongs to those who are capable of change.
I hope that we will be capable of changing, our enslavement to the past, that we will be capable of closing the divide between Eastern and Western Europe and forming a single unit that is free from complexes about the superiority of the United States or anyone else.
I should like to end my contribution by pointing out that, while Prime Minister Topolánek's speech was peppered with noble intentions, resolutions and goals, and while it is quite right and proper for the Czech Presidency to set out ambitious projects - I do have one sceptical comment, in the form of an aphorism by the Polish satirist Jerzy Lec, to the effect that going on a holy pilgrimage will not stop your feet from sweating.
<D>
I voted against this report, to which I have always expressed my strong opposition.
While I approve of the idea of providing better information to patients, I disapprove of the means used to do so.
The pharmaceutical industry's goal will never be one of philanthropy.
Moreover, there is a very fine line between information and advertising.
It is true that the text, which was adopted almost unanimously, has nothing to do with the Commission's initial idea.
The latter would have simply opened the door to advertising disguised under the label 'Information'.
That proposal corresponded, moreover, to the pharmaceutical sector's clear expectation of being able to get out of the legal ban on advertising of medicines.
The report, as adopted today, includes many more guarantees: that the information provided by pharmaceutical companies for dissemination will, in particular, be checked beforehand, and will not be disseminated by the media.
Nevertheless, the authorisation to publish package leaflet summaries means that there will be items that must be highlighted and others, such as adverse reactions, which may well be regularly excluded from the summaries, as they do not 'sell' well.
Is that not already a promotional move?
Was that really the aim?
Was the game really worth the candle?
<D>
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, once again we are dedicating a debate in plenary to the reform of the European Union Solidarity Fund which, as we all know, is intended to alleviate the damage caused by a major natural disaster within the Union territory.
This Fund very quickly proved to be ineffective in meeting its set objectives and, as a result, in 2005, the European Commission presented a proposal modifying the regulation governing this instrument of solidarity.
The aim was to improve not only its operability, but also access to it and its coverage in the event of a major natural disaster.
The European Parliament, as can be easily proven, worked promptly and intensively on this proposal so that in May 2006 our institution had finished its first reading.
At that time we all thought and believed that the Council would do the same, given that this was a regulation under the codecision procedure.
However, as we now all know, that was not the case.
Contrary to expectations, the Council put a hold on the process due to its inaction.
During this period, in addition to serious flooding, the European Union has suffered serious fires, which in some cases have resulted in deaths, and also major droughts.
However, the Council has remained impassive.
The proposal to improve the regulation is still sitting on the Council's table, despite calls from the European institutions and social forces.
Today we want to once again call on the Council to act and remind it that modifying this regulation will not require one additional euro from the Community budget: our demands have no financial consequences and aim solely at rectifying the operational problems that have arisen since this instrument of solidarity was created.
We simply want to improve its operability and agility, always in line with the subsidiarity principle.
We note that, as this instrument currently stands, access to it is very difficult, restrictive and inflexible, as we have unfortunately witnessed over the nearly seven years of its operation.
I therefore want to ask whether this inability of the delegations forming the Council to reach a common position has any real explanation, and whether anyone can tell us who and what arguments are blocking reform of this regulation.
We should like the European Commission to drive forward the reform of this fund, to tell us what actions it plans to take, and to clearly set out the possible alternatives that it is considering in order to help unblock this matter.
If the Commission does have any alternatives, we should of course like to know what they are and what their time horizon is.
I believe it is appropriate to remind those present, in particular the French Presidency, that this instrument was set up with a laudable objective: to promptly, adequately and visibly show the Union's solidarity with its citizens.
To end, Mr President, I want to make another call, this time specifically to the French Presidency, on a matter closely linked to this one: the creation of a European civil protection force, on which Michel Barnier, a former Commissioner as you all know, presented a report to the European Council in 2006.
I am ending.
The Fund was created in particular as a symbolic expression of solidarity between the European Union and its citizens.
My final plea is that, if we manage, after so much time and effort, to make this operative in any degree, our first thought and action should be directed towards those who have died in these disasters in the European Union.
<D>
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, at the end of last week a delegation from our Parliament debated the grave situation in the Middle East with our US counterparts as part of the Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue (TLD).
During this, the US peace negotiator Dennis Ross gave us the very practical advice to offer the Palestinian population assistance with its precarious existence.
A network of reliable, politically independent NGOs is needed.
Council and Commission: to what extent do you envisage real possibilities for both the West Bank and Gaza?
I now take the view that the behaviour of Hamas lies behind the present internal and external crisis situation in Gaza.
It unfailingly delegitimises the State of Israel and legitimises violence against Israelis and Palestinian 'dissidents'.
Mr President, the recent brutal murder of the Palestinian Christian Rami Ayyad, who was only thirty years old, underlines the perilous position of this minority in Gaza.
I expect of the Council and the Commission that they devote attention and provide support to the Christian minority in all the Palestinian territories.
<D>
The report focuses on a topic that is enormously important in today's world.
This is the question of workers' rights.
So-called social dumping represents a major threat for workers as it undermines their rights in a fundamental way.
International companies are the main players when it comes to applying social standards.
It is therefore absolutely essential to define the social responsibility of companies clearly and unambiguously so that we can limit the number of differing interpretations and establish minimum obligations in this area, as well as a method for monitoring their fulfilment.
Many firms come into regions only for the temporary financial advantage, mostly because of cheap labour.
Companies generally refuse to establish long-term links in a region, and therefore to participate in shared social responsibility in the region.
The report calls for the strengthening of basic employment standards, which are enshrined in the conventions of the International Labour Organisation, including freedom of association and collective bargaining, the elimination of forced and compulsory labour, the elimination of discrimination in the workplace and the abolition of child labour.
It demands changes in the global administration system and in the EU, with the aim of better protection of workers' rights and employment conditions.
The rapporteurs have managed to defend a clear social dimension in the submitted report, and I have therefore voted in favour of the report.
<D>
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the years and decades that now lie behind us, we had a disastrously low price for agricultural products and it was essential, and urgent, for it to increase worldwide.
This is a very good development because the price level was below the production costs for organic/rural agriculture, and that has destroyed the livelihoods of hundreds of millions of farmers, not only in the third world but also here in the European Union.
If, as Mr Schulz says, this is being fuelled by speculation, then that has something to do with the fact that now, after the European Union did away with export subsidies and allowed premiums to run down, we have something more like an intervention mechanism, where food and feedstuff are linked to the price of oil, because we are starting to make petrol from food and feedstuff.
This promotes speculation because, all around the world, the possibility and necessity of transporting feedstuff is increasing.
The European Union is the world's largest importer of food and feedstuff, which means that we have no surpluses and that the mechanism by which we convert the imports - which amount to 50 million tonnes of grain units, bought almost below the poverty threshold from third world countries - into food, which is then dumped and exported at a cost of billions and undersold on regional markets in third world countries, has ultimately destroyed rural agriculture and regional subsistence farming.
Therefore, we must see this as an opportunity.
This does not mean that I believe that agrifuels are the panacea, because the energy balance is negative and because that gives rise to speculation, but we must try to convert material which is actually available, as waste, into energy.
To put it more bluntly, we must make gold from shit rather than thinking that we are competing with food for humans.
It is not possible for everyone in the world to have full gas tanks and full plates based only on the plants that grow.
It might be possible in Europe, because we are rich enough to purchase these products and these crop harvests for ourselves, but the rest of the world would go hungry.
In closing I would like to add one further thought: We have 850 million people who are starving, and these 850 million people were already starving when the price level was disastrously low.
What has now happened is that the purchasing power of the middle classes in third world countries has decreased so that these people are finding it difficult to buy other consumer goods.
This thwarts the strategy of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
Now people are calling for more money, but the 850 million starving people were already in need of that money.
<D>
Madam President, things rarely happen at convenient times and any crisis, by definition, is going to be inconvenient.
The financial and economic crises currently confronting us are unwelcome in themselves, but they also come in the closing months of the Parliament and the final year of the Commission, when all of us might normally be thinking of the next election and new appointments.
This Commission work programme almost has the feel of a 'business as usual' exercise, yet the situation demands fresh thought on how to head off what threatens to be a deep recession.
It presents Europe with a big challenge because most measures of fiscal policy need to be taken at national level, yet the EU has a crucial role of coordination.
The magnitude of the challenges facing us makes that particularly important.
In the field of energy, we have a pretty good idea of things that need to be done, but most of them are on a timescale well beyond the next year or two, so perhaps the only area where swift action - which could help - could be taken is in the field of energy efficiency measures.
Specifically, allowing lower VAT for improvements in the energy efficiency of buildings and launching an information campaign to encourage a change in people's behaviour are two specific ways to help the situation.
Beyond that, it seems to me that there will never be a better time to set up one of the EU's famous groups of wise people - and in this case I suggest it should be wise men and women - to reflect on the challenge we face and come up with original solutions beyond the short-term remedy of throwing money at tax giveaways.
I hope that Council and Commission will give this idea a fair wind.
<D>
Despite the somewhat emotional words on the financial crisis and related crises, basic measures to deal effectively with these crises are still not forthcoming.
Even when some ad-hoc measures that were rejected only a few months ago are accepted, such as the nationalisations of banks that have gone bankrupt due to poor management on the part of their administrators and some of their main shareholders, who have pocketed the substantial profits and gains and left the general public to deal with the damage, this is always done in defence of big business, without really taking into account the interests of workers and the least well-off.
They do not tackle the root of the issue.
They do not abolish tax havens.
They do not scrap the false independence of the European Central Bank.
They do not do away with the Stability Pact.
They do not adopt a Solidarity and Social Progress Pact.
The ECB lowered its own base rate too late, after a short-sightedness that has already cost the more fragile economies and those who are in debt to the banks dearly.
In this way, the issues that are on the table are of prime importance and call into question the neoliberal policies that gave utmost priority to free competition, worsening exploitation of workers and multiplying the problems of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises.
There needs to be a clear break with these neoliberal policies at the next Council.
<D>
in writing. - (DE) Last year we committed to tough and ambitious environmental targets and the time has now come to face up to the challenge of achieving them.
The imperative for the EU, however, is to attain its environmental goals without committing economic suicide.
We must not play ecology off against the economy.
I therefore welcome the compromise that was identified at the recent summit.
Combating climate change comes at a cost of course.
However, the cost of inaction will greatly exceed the cost of the mitigation measures required.
Nonetheless, it is essential to ensure that the burden of reducing CO2 emissions is divided equitably among the Member States and industrial sectors, and also, in my view, to ensure that those Member States that have already done more than the others to combat climate change are not put at a disadvantage.
The energy-intensive sectors must make their contribution to cutting CO2 emissions as well.
We must demand that they, too, convert their production processes to the latest environmentally-friendly technologies.
In the interests of competitiveness in the European economy, however, we must do our utmost to prevent any relocation of CO2-intensive sectors to countries outside the EU.
If the climate movement in Europe could motivate developing economies such as China or India to play their part as well, that would be a welcome step.
<D>
(ET) Ladies and gentlemen.
Enlargement in 2004 increased economic growth in the European Union by an amount which engendered unjustified confidence.
However, today the cooling of the economy is causing social tensions even in the new Member States.
I am referring to the bill on employment contracts which is currently causing controversy in my home country, Estonia.
In anticipation of redundancies, Estonian businesspeople are trying to make people who are to be made redundant bear the brunt of the social effects of the disappearance of employment.
Perhaps those who are more vulnerable, namely employees who have lost their jobs, are once again at a loss as to what they are being punished for.
In the absence of effective steps, both secure flexibility and lifelong learning are reduced merely to empty words in whose shadow the more vulnerable in society are left without the support they need.
Raising the retirement age in line with the rise in average life expectancy means that a 45-year-old worker has yet to reach the mid-point of his career.
It means a new beginning in middle age.
Yet discrimination on grounds of age and sex is an undeniable reality in work places the world over, including the European Union.
The trend towards having children later in life means that women find it twice as difficult to return to the labour market.
The Lifelong Learning Programme is an opportunity at least to a certain degree to compensate for the injustice which prevails today.
Similarly, employers should be encouraged to invest in people with experience of life.
Employers should be persuaded that knowledge and skills learnt in other areas of life, yes, even in home economics, are extremely valuable.
I wish to stress once again that the lifelong learning system is merely a supplement to the social pledges, not a replacement for them.
Drivers, no matter how experienced, should always fasten their seatbelts.
I thank and congratulate the rapporteur on a fine piece of work.
Thank you, Mrs Pack!
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all allow me to express my thanks for the very interesting debate that has just taken place.
I have carefully noted the comments made, since they are extremely useful for me and the Commission - and the customs services - in taking into account the political priorities expressed by the European Parliament.
I was very much impressed by the explicit expression of appreciation and support for the work of the Customs Union; I can assure you that it will continue.
What are the guarantees?
The guarantees are that we have the instruments, we have the strategy, and we have the legal basis, the modernised Community Customs Code with rules and procedures that guarantee the facilitation of legitimate trade and also the protection of the internal market, the safety, the health and the life of our citizens.
We have the ID technology in the framework of eCustoms, and we have a very wide cooperation network: cooperation among the customs authorities of the Member States, cooperation with other law enforcement agencies, cooperation with business - and referring to the contribution of Mr Harbour, I should like to say that in Frankfurt last week I had the chance to get information on the MediFake project, which is about counterfeit medicines, and if any distinction may be drawn between the different kinds of fake products, certainly pharmaceuticals are the most dangerous.
I am happy to tell you that just a couple of days ago in the country I know best, in Hungary, there was an agreement between the customs authorities and the Association of Pharmaceutical Factories in Hungary on how to prevent fake pharmaceuticals from getting onto the market.
We also have cooperation with international organisations, with third countries like China, and I must say that, in what are now more than three years of dealing with this portfolio and holding regular meetings with the Chinese authorities, I have certainly witnessed some improvement in the Chinese attitude.
They are more concrete; they are speaking more to the point; they are more cooperative, more constructive.
Probably the reason is that for them it is more and more a question of political prestige.
China, which is playing a more and more important role, not only in world trade but also in world politics, cannot afford to be labelled as the main source, as the main country of origin of those fake products that endanger the safety, the health and even the life of the citizens of other countries.
Another reason is that, as much evidence has proved, China is becoming more and more a target country and not merely a country of origin.
At least two speakers mentioned the 100% scanning initiative of the US Congress: I want to tell you that we are really trying to exert pressure on the US Administration, and indirectly even on US legislation, because we are absolutely certain - and we keep saying it - that this initiative would result in the disruption of international trade in maritime shipping, it would create a false sense of security and it would just divert attention and resources from the real issues.
We hope that finally we will be successful.
So with your support, with the support of Parliament, with the support of committees like the IMCO and INTA Committees which have been very actively supporting the Customs Union, I am sure that the successful activities of the Customs Union in the next, fourth year will be guaranteed.
Thank you very much for your contributions and support.
<D>
No parliament, no parliamentary majority comprising the representatives and servants of the barbaric capitalist system can use slander, lies and forgery to wipe out the history of social revolution, written and signed by the people with their blood.
No black anti-communist front can wipe out the huge contribution made by socialism, its unprecedented achievements and its abolition of the exploitation of man by man.
The joint motion for a resolution by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, which was also supported by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament in an indescribably vulgar manner, equates fascism with communism, Nazi fascist regimes with socialist regimes.
With a pitiful quid pro quo they are proposing a joint European Day of Remembrance for perpetrators and the victims.
Thus they are acquitting fascism, slandering socialism and exonerating imperialism of the crimes which it committed and is committing today.
Ideologically they are promoting capitalism as the only 'democratic system'.
Any political forces which sit on the fence, thereby giving this obscurantist policy an alibi, also bear serious responsibility for this anti-communist hysteria.
The Greek Communist Party calls on the working class and every progressive person to condemn anti-communism and its agents.
<D>
Mr President, I shall not dispute the figures that Mr Corbett has just read out.
I do not particularly care if this Parliament costs less per capita than others - though I think there are one or two more people across the European Union than there might be in the United Kingdom.
My concern with this report is that it is a missed opportunity.
It highlights many of the expensive regimes that we have all noticed in our time here - I have been here for 10 years, like you, Mr President.
It is interesting, for example, that the European Parliament's main library is in Luxembourg, where no one can access it, because the Members rotate between Brussels, Strasbourg and their home seats.
There are lots of missed opportunities in this place, and this report is most definitely one of them.
At a time when all our constituents are having to tighten their belts, we should have signalled in this report that we were willing to tighten ours too, and we did not.
It is a missed opportunity.
<D>
(FI) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the energy sector is now faced with a very ethical challenge.
Energy and bread are now at odds with one another.
This is nothing less than the difference between prosperity and poverty.
The consequences of speculation are that the cost of grain is in practice tied to the price of oil.
The higher that is, the more grain will also be used as fuel, unless we intervene.
Now only about 2% of grain is used in the production of biofuel, but that figure is rising.
The Organization for Economic Development and the United Nations estimated that if the price of oil reached the 56 dollar level, the production of grain for food would go down by a couple of percentage points and the price of grain, which is to say food, would go up by around 10%.
What about if the price of oil kept rising to reach the 100 dollar mark, which is where it is now?
We urgently need international norms and agreements, so that the rise in the cost of food can be halted, as can the switch from the use of grain to make bread to the use of grain to make fuel for four-by-fours on our roads.
We might imagine all sorts of threatening scenarios, but there is some good news.
Russia is working on a scheme to produce competitive renewable energy for the European market.
That means hydroelectric power, the use of reserves of water and forest mass on a large scale - in fact, the world's largest.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, there have been some wonderful arguments, at least in abstract and general terms, over whether we should have deregulation or over-regulation.
However, when it comes to the individual case it is always possible that either of these solutions will prove to be the most practical.
On the subject of airport charges the Commission was, in my view, quite right to put forward a proposal for a directive, even though in the case of the Costa report we were also right to praise the efforts being made to reduce the administrative burden.
Airports are important economic players and there are positive as well as potentially negative consequences associated with the key economic role they play.
In its proposal the Commission has put forward an interesting concept, though perhaps it is somewhat too finely woven.
We in the Committee on Transport and Tourism have made a few changes, and I hope, and indeed believe, that these are for the better.
Our rapporteur, Mr Stockmann, held a series of lengthy talks with all the stakeholders, and especially with the various groups in this House, before producing some excellent compromises that we were for the most part able to support.
I would just like to focus on three aspects.
Firstly, we wanted to ensure that the directive would prevent individual airports from abusing their dominant market position.
Secondly, we need Community-wide provisions in order to establish a smooth-functioning, non-discriminatory, transparent and comprehensive procedure for calculating these charges.
Thirdly, it is logical to set up an independent regulatory authority in each Member State in order to ensure that the provisions are implemented.
I am assuming that our proposals will be adopted tomorrow in plenary by a large majority and would like to congratulate the rapporteur, in particular, on his excellent work.
<D>
in writing. - (NL) In my explanation of vote on the 2009 budget of 23 October 2008, I drew your attention to the value of the EU's involvement in providing schoolchildren with fruit.
A school fruit scheme can be useful to prevent children from becoming ever more obese and unhealthy.
The question is why the EU should take care of this, rather than the municipalities that organise education.
Payments are currently made from the EU fund to the Member States, which are obliged to add a further sum, with the municipalities then being responsible for implementing the scheme.
This way of working creates much unnecessary administration and time-consuming red tape.
During the recent budget discussion, the amount was doubled to EUR 182 million, and thanks to the Busk report, this sum will be increased to EUR 500 million in future.
The Dutch Agriculture Minister, who is in favour of the present scheme, has announced in the press that she considers this enormous increase to be of no value and will be speaking out against it.
Since it is not Parliament that decides on this, but the Council, it is to be expected that this increase will not materialise.
Meanwhile, though, school fruit has, in the public mind's eye, come to represent EU priorities that are wide of the mark.
<D>
(HU) Increasing the transparency of the Common Agricultural Policy is an important Community objective, and so I support the report by my fellow member, Mr Chatzimarkakis.
But since the Common Agricultural Policy is already being discussed, I would like to draw your attention to one of the most important issues in environmentally conscious farming, the Natura 2000 programme.
As you know, those who farm in a manner that sustains protected flora and fauna receive aid from the Community and Member states, within the framework of Natura 2000.
Nearly 1/5 of the territory of the European Union, and 21% of the territory of Hungary, comes under the protection of this programme.
Farmers expect this aid, since sustaining natural interests requires financial self-restraint on their part.
However, it is crucial for a sustainable future that we protect as many natural interests as possible.
This is why it is important that we put as much money as possible into aid for areas affected by the Natura 2000 programme.
At the time, I was the shadow rapporteur for the Socialist Group for the Natura 2000 programme.
Unfortunately, since then it has not been possible to bring about the amount for which we pressed at the time, EUR 3 billion a year.
However, it is the eleventh hour if we want to stop the obliteration of nature, particularly in Europe, which is already over-populated.
It would be useful to have the planned Internet list of how much aid is given to farmers within the framework of Natura 2000, thus popularising practices that point forward.
This openness will hopefully also stimulate environmentally friendly farming and the protection of our unique natural interests.
Thank you.
<D>
President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, Srebrenica, as we all know, was a horrible crime.
The massacre of more than 8 000 Bosniaks in and around Srebrenica marks one of the darkest historical moments of Bosnia and Herzegovina, of the former Yugoslavia and also of Europe as a whole.
It is without a doubt the worst atrocity in Europe since the Second World War.
Looking back, much more could have been done, and earlier.
Srebrenica was a collective failure of the international community, the EU included.
That is a great shame and we deeply regret this fact.
It is our moral, human and political obligation that a Srebrenica never happens again.
Marking the 10th anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre, the Council expressed its renewed condemnation of the crimes committed and extended it s compassion for the victims and their families.
The Council, recalling the UN Security Council resolutions 1503 and 1534, underlined that full and unrestricted cooperation with the ICTY remain an essential requirement for continuing progress towards the EU.
The transfer to The Hague of the remaining fugitive indictees who continue to elude international justice would be a fitting tribute to the victims of Srebrenica as well as a major stride towards permanent peace, stability and reconciliation.
Therefore, the Council remains determined that the perpetrators of crimes in Srebrenica and in Bosnia and Herzegovina in general, as well as elsewhere in the region of the Western Balkans, must be brought to justice.
At the same time, throughout history European integration has proved helpful to heal wounds and injustice of the past, so we need to concentrate on the future as well.
The EU as the integrating factor brought peace, stability, trust and prosperity to Europe in the second half of the last century.
Helping the Western Balkans on the path towards the EU therefore belongs to the priorities of the Czech presidency in the domain of external relations.
Reconciliation is vital for integration and reconciliation is difficult if justice is not served fully.
After 13 years it is time to bring the shameful Srebrenica episode to a closure.
Karadžić's arrest has proved that there is no impunity for such monstrous crimes as those against humanity.
Still, Ratko Mladić needs to be brought to The Hague so that the families of the Srebrenica victims can be helped to deal with the past and embrace their future.
The EU will keep doing everything in its power to make this happen.
But also a lot more needs to be done so that Srebrenica turns from a sad historical memory to a place where life does offer prospects.
The international community's engagement does not take place in a vacuum: it is actively combined with the local actions on the state level, as well as by both entities.
A lot of good endeavours have been carried out.
Srebrenica's future can be best secured through economic development and job creation to improve economic and social conditions of the population of the Srebrinica region.
The Republika Srpska authorities, as well as the Bosnia and Herzegovina Council of Ministers and the Federation, provided funding and investment for the Srebrenica region.
The allocated assets were aimed for Srebrenica recovery including construction, reconstruction, infrastructure development, business promotion, improvement of public services, projects with sustainable return and education.
All those local efforts were underpinned also with the donor conference for Srebrenica organised just over a year ago, in November 2007.
This might be a good occasion for an appeal to provide more new investment for this city and its region.
It is of the utmost importance that Srebrenica is never forgotten and that a joint effort continues.
We all in the EU, the international community and the local authorities pursue working constructively together to improve living conditions in the Srebrenica area.
Only the prospect of a better life can help to reduce the political tension, creating a space for dialogue and consequently allowing the still grieving victims' relatives to move on.
That would be the best possible tribute to the victims of Srebrenica.
<D>
in writing. - Following the recent, in fact current, financial and economic upheaval and the global repercussions, I feel there is a necessity to re-evaluate the definition and thresholds of poverty.
I am concerned that a significant amount of poverty is not as obvious as it was decades ago but I am afraid it is just as real.
The contemporary lifestyle helps camouflage this new poverty to a large extent.
The purchasing power of many households is being eroded by sharp increases in costs in general, and especially those relating to food, health and energy.
Families with low incomes, pensioners, the unemployed and other niches within our society are at risk of becoming vulnerable and will struggle to survive as these costs represent the largest share of their monthly budget.
The performance of economies worldwide is expected to deteriorate rapidly as a recession is expected to take over.
This would inevitably create instabilities in all sectors of the economy.
Reductions in social programmes and services would compound the problem for those who are experiencing an erosion in their purchasing power.
I feel that the Union and the Member States have to address this issue to reduce the drastic inequalities and hardships that hidden poverty is having on many EU citizens.
<D>
rapporteur. - Mr President, our proposals - Mr Lamassoure's and mine - confirmed by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, bring a number of improvements to the current practices regarding the composition of the European Parliament.
If adopted, and properly enhanced, there will be no more artificial groupings, no more arbitrary negotiations, no more enlargement at the expense of the efficiency of the European Parliament, which is always growing with the number of Members.
There will be more representativity, based on demographic realities and not on nominal or symbolic legal relations, more solidarity between the big and small states resulting from the digressive proportionality of the representation, and full legitimacy based on the civic representation resulting from the fact that the European Parliament is elected by European citizens.
One should note the difference between the democratic legitimacy of the European Parliament, which is based on the vote of the European citizens, and national representativity within the European Parliament, which is based on the demographic realities within the Member States.
We, the European Parliament, are representative of citizens and of the states at the same time.
(Murmurs of dissent)
You see, immediately, some say only citizens, others say states.
We are a Bundestag and a Bundesrat at the same time.
A clear separation of this dimension should, perhaps, be considered in the future, but for the time being - once we have accepted that the citizens are voting and that digressive proportionality should take into consideration the size of the communities living on national territories - I am sorry, but we are both.
Of course, within this framework, the concept of European citizenship is still to be clarified, and I hope that this will be done in the near future.
Our report, however, is not provisional but transitional.
It is transitional because I believe the principles we have defined are long-lasting, but progress is needed, and I am sure that in the future we can add to what we have already proposed to you.
Therefore, we have included a number of revision clauses which to our minds - Mr Lamassoure's and mine - will assure flexibility, adaptability and future progress in the way in which Parliament is composed.
Nobody is penalised by this report.
Maybe those with a better demographic policy are rewarded, and certainly it is an invitation for a better demographic policy, including migration policy.
I do not think anybody loses - and, perhaps, nobody wins - in terms of a zero-sum game.
As long as we have a more democratically legitimate Parliament, everybody wins.
We have some amendments.
Some colleagues would like to reduce digressivity in favour of proportionality - more proportionality means more seats for the big countries.
Some others would like more digressivity and not more proportionality.
More digressivity means more seats for small countries.
Therefore, I believe that we have to reject both these extreme options in order to promote the option which is, I agree, imperfect, but which for the time being is the best one.
This is the option proposed by Mr Lamassoure and myself.
Some would look on the basis of reference.
Some would like all their national citizens, irrespective of their country of residence, to be taken into consideration.
Others would like to see all inhabitants in their countries being taken into consideration.
Others are trying to see only the European citizens residing in a certain country.
So we are divided on that.
The only solution is to stick with the actual practices and the actual Eurostat figures.
Finally, there are some who are fighting for political prestige and think that, if we are not equally represented in this Parliament, we are unequal in our political weight.
I think that once we have accepted digressivity - and proportional digressivity - these artificial groupings cannot survive any longer.
If we fail to adopt this resolution, I am afraid that the European Parliament will send the message that it is not able to adopt an important reform and that it has to always wait for the executive institution to decide for it.
I think that the IGC will suffer a first failure before it can even consider the issues on its agenda, and this failure might be a prelude to a total failure.
I am afraid that everybody will go back to Nice and not to illusory dreams.
I am afraid that, then, we will give a message which will mean a split between the big and small countries, and this will undermine any dream of unity, fairness and inclusion.
Therefore, I end with an appeal to all my colleagues.
I make this appeal to our sense of European responsibility and European solidarity.
Hic Rhodus, hic salta!
Here is Rhodes, and let us prove here that we are true Europeans, and not when giving lessons to the Commission and the Council.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, Madam Vice-President, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, the diversity of the messages coming from the plenary to the Commission today cannot be ignored.
I will therefore focus as far as possible on a few key points which I hope my fellow Members will endorse.
In my view, what we are able to agree on - and Madam Vice-President, you mentioned this earlier - is that the European Union must maintain its commitment to the fundamental principle of the social market economy while promoting the interests of the business sector and consumers alike.
At an individual level, that is a difficult balancing act whose outcome may, of course, vary according to one's political standpoint.
However, I believe - and here, I would like to follow on from what Mr Nassauer said - that during the coming months, the Commission must develop a better sense of what is required in terms of subsidiarity.
If we look at the type of proposals you presented on the procurement of eco-friendly vehicles or what you intend to propose as regards eco-friendly procurement in the work programme, you clearly take the view that our cities' mayors, as ordinary mortals, are not able to make eco-friendly decisions themselves, and you therefore feel a need to prescribe what they should be doing from your position at Europe's centre.
In our view, this is the wrong approach.
We want individuals themselves to understand that environmentally friendly procurement is in their own interests.
To that end, we need more subsidiarity in these sectors, more best practice and less dirigisme.
Madam Vice-President, may I also encourage the Commission to adopt a more courageous approach in its negotiations with Member States in future, for example when it comes to the issue of how we should harmonise consumer protection legislation in the European Union in the interests of companies and in the interests of consumers.
Proceeding with this harmonisation will only make sense if we genuinely harmonise the entire sphere of consumer protection law and leave the Member States no further scope to tinker on the margins of this harmonised acquis.
Otherwise, it is a pointless exercise.
<D>
in writing. - I agree with the recommendations emerging from this resolution, which comes at an urgent time to address the financial crisis.
It must first be said that we are not through the crisis yet and that the authorities cannot relax in the thought that it will pass.
Several key aspects are important to be acted on.
First, dealing with 'systemic risks': the international institutions need to be strengthened to face future threats.
Inside the EU a sole authority such as the ECB must be considered for reasons of coordinating strong actions when urgently required.
Secondly, the revamping of existing legislation and introduction of new legislation which recognises the specific needs of sectors of the financial services industry, in particular Solvency II and CRD, are vital elements which contribute to the management of risk.
Also, credit rating agencies are now going to be regulated.
On the fiscal measures currently being envisaged by Member States, it is important to continue with sensible, balanced approaches which also do not add up to protectionism.
We will face rising unemployment and falling demand.
Social policies, too, have to reflect the concerns of European citizens and need to be of higher concern than seems apparent from the recommendations currently known.
<D>
Mr President, the Horn of Africa is currently a real powder keg, not only due to the situation of total instability in Somalia and Sudan, but also in the three countries that Mr Kaczmarek, Mr Hutchinson and I had the pleasure of visiting.
The three countries to which the delegation's visit was confined - Eritrea, Djibouti and Ethiopia - have in common poverty and therefore a very low standard of human rights.
As regards poverty, according to the figures given to our delegation, the Government of Ethiopia has acknowledged that six and a half million people are already affected by famine.
The United Nations puts this figure at over twelve million.
We are therefore facing a humanitarian crisis that is not being reported in the media, due to other current international crises, even though it is truly shocking.
The human rights situation also deserves our attention, given the existence of political prisoners - and that is the word for them: political prisoners - in all three countries.
The border dispute between Eritrea and Ethiopia is totally absurd, as also is the involvement of more than 200 000 soldiers in this dispute.
I cannot end my speech without congratulating Commissioner Michel on his actions in the area and for starting a political dialogue.
This dialogue must continue but it must also be made clear that we will be very firm: firm in defending human rights and firm towards the outrages being committed through the adoption of laws in relation to NGOs.
It must be borne in mind that, thanks to this political dialogue, we are proving that the European Union enjoys high prestige at international level.
<D>
Madam President, any fair-minded person who has followed the two cases at the WTO would really come to the conclusion that to use an English phrase 'it is a six of one and half a dozen of the other'.
For example, Boeing receives US Federal and State Government support exceeding the 1992 EU-US agreement; Boeing receives subsidies from NASA and the Department of Defense programmes; Boeing benefits from non-competitive military contracts at inflated prices and Boeing benefits from the US foreign sales corporation tax breaks, infringing WTO law.
Opposite to that, the US complains that Airbus receives launch aid relating to R&D; it receives grants for development and production sites; it receives loans on preferential terms; it receives debt forgiveness relating to large civil aircraft production and development financing; it receives R&D grants directly benefiting Airbus and it complains that it receives illegal export subsidies.
On a positive side, many EU airlines continue to order Boeing aircraft and the US Department of Defense did award the contract in the first place to the EADS Northrop Grumman tanker.
Those are positive signs.
While both sides have cause for complaint, I am afraid that what we find in this question is naked anti-Americanism and a petty, little European mentality.
Airbus is cast as the angelic saviour of European skies while Boeing is the evil American company seeking to unfairly dominate global aviation.
I sincerely hope that my group, the EPP, does not see fit to support this resolution since it would really show my group at its very worst - anti-American, protectionist and anti-competitive.
Maybe we are allowing ourselves to be overly influenced by the French presidency, but please let's not allow the initials EPP to stand for the European Protectionist Party.

(RO) In general, rail transport is safer, faster and causes less pollution than road transport.
However, in 2007, roughly 2 600 people were victims of rail accidents, while last year, more rail accidents occurred involving passenger and freight trains.
The recent rail accident in Belgium, with a casualty list of 20 dead and more than 120 injured, refocuses our attention in a shocking way on the importance of rail transport safety.
Unfortunately, the economic and financial crisis has exacerbated the financial difficulties facing both operators and administrators involved in the rail transport infrastructure.
It is a major concern that the lack of specialist staff and financial resources for implementing the ERTMS is one of the possible causes of the accident, while thousands of rail workers are losing their jobs.
I call on Member States and the Commission to take the necessary measures in order to:
1. modernise the rail infrastructure and existing rolling stock to guarantee efficient and safe rail transport,
2. give priority to the investments required for rail transport safety and security, and
3. develop new rail transport infrastructures and implement the ERTMS.
<D>
(PT) The 'yes' vote in Ireland is good news for Europe and for me personally, as a Portuguese citizen and a committed pro-European.
It represents a victory for common sense and reason against demagogy and manipulation.
The Irish people have clearly stated that they believe in the European project.
With the 'yes' vote, the main obstacle to the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon has been overcome.
President Klaus now has no excuse and has to respect democracy and the parliament which elected him, and which has already approved the Treaty of Lisbon.
The Treaty of Lisbon marks the beginning of a new era.
The European Union will make decisions more efficiently and will be more effective in its external relations.
It will be more democratic and more transparent, closer to the public and less dependent on governments.
With the new Treaty, the European Union will be better equipped to fight climate change and to meet the challenges of globalisation.
<D>
(RO) I would like to begin by congratulating our rapporteurs who have been working flat out on this package for more than a year.
This is actually an extremely important package for the European Union's citizens.
This package includes numerous documents.
I think it is important for me to refer first of all to Mrs Trautmann's report, which sets out the regulatory framework for the electronic communications sector and has covered a number of extremely important aspects, such as functional separation, spectrum policy, as well as the use and promotion of new generation networks.
I welcome the fact that functional separation was adopted and accepted as an urgent, special measure.
In addition, I believe that it is vital for us to emphasise here that consumers' rights must be protected.
This is why Mr Harbour's report touched on these aspects and our colleague, Reino Paasilinna, successfully supported the European Socialists' point of view, which is that the key element must be the consumer.
It is important how the contractual clauses are negotiated so that any consumer can be protected.
On the subject of technological neutrality, it is useful that a wide range of technical options is made available to everyone in this way.
But I would like to stress that the Internet offers huge opportunities.
It is important for consumers and users to be protected and for there to be no interference with personal data, which must also be protected.
Above all, we must protect intellectual property, but not to the detriment of consumers' interests.
(The President cut off the speaker)
<D>
rapporteur (BG). - Thank you, Madam President, and thank you for that reminder.
During my many years of working as a judge, I have always seen to order in the court.
So, Madam President and Mr Diamandouros, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honour for me to be the rapporteur for the annual Ombudsman's report.
The Ombudsman is a figure in the European institutional system whose purpose is to defend the rights of European citizens and to counter maladministration.
For this reason I would like to congratulate the European Ombudsman, Mr Diamandouros, for his dedication and his professionalism, because what he does is very important for ordinary people.
As Jean Monnet said, we are building Union among people, not cooperation between States.
Similarly, I have had the pleasure of working on a report that unites, rather than divides the political groups in the European Parliament.
As it is clear that we have been elected to this House by the citizens of Europe to protect their interests, it is with this conviction that we also found compromises to accommodate some of the amendments tabled by the other political groups.
These proposals and today's debate are proof that the European Parliament takes this important mechanism for protecting European citizens very seriously.
I would also like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Secretariat and all those who contributed to making this report more complete.
It is my deep conviction that it is through the institution of the European Ombudsman that citizens will be better able to exercise their rights in cases of maladministration, because even if the rules are good, it is important that they are properly applied to provide maximum protection.
I believe that, just as the Commission is called the protector of treaties, the European Ombudsman is the champion of the correct implementation of Community legislation, although it is not alone in this role.
The European Parliament, as the only democratically elected institution, is also called upon to uphold citizens' rights, which makes it all the more important that Parliament and the Ombudsman work hand in hand.
The report is also important because analysing the situation as it is in the course of the year will above all help us to learn lessons and take the right decisions for the future.
We should not forget that behind every complaint, behind each number in the statistics, is a human being who is expecting the right help and a solution to his or her problem.
While I was working on the report, I realised that a key aspect is information.
The report shows that many citizens do not yet know how to stand up for the rights given to them by the European Union when faced with maladministration.
An example of this is the number of ineligible complaints - 84%.
This clearly shows that the Ombudsman and the European institutions must continue in this direction together, and inform European citizens so that they can exercise their rights to the full.
That is why the report also proposes a common website for lodging complaints to all the institutions, something along the lines of the interactive manual designed by the Ombudsman, where citizens who have entered the requisite data are directed to the relevant institution, to which they can then directly lodge their complaint.
This will help to reduce the number of inadmissible complaints.
Apart from that, I also focussed on what guarantees there are that citizens and those permanently resident in the EU know and make use of their rights, and whether the assistance they are given is easily accessible, fair, impartial and effective.
I would like to point out that there is nothing the Ombudsman can do in over 30% of cases.
In my view, the Ombudsman should always explain why no action can be taken on a particular complaint, thereby making it more useful to citizens.
I would also like to point out that the Ombudsmen at national, regional and local level play a key role, and their activities should be developed.
In conclusion, I call upon you to vote for this report, because it supports constructive cooperation between the Ombudsman and the institutions and bodies of the European Union, and confirms the Ombudsman's role as an external control mechanism and a source of constant improvement for European administration.
Thank you.
<D>
in writing. - (HU) Mr President, the disturbances in Tibet have left several hundred people dead.
China only mentions thirteen.
One death is too many.
The Tibetan demonstrators were allegedly shot in self-defence.
The Chinese Premier blames the Dalai Lama for the situation that has arisen.
It is a familiar story.
A Communist country riding roughshod over human rights.
A minority fighting for its rights, calling for the autonomy it has been promised, but which has been taken from it.
There has been talk of a boycott, of non-attendance, but also of conciliation and dialogue.
If nothing happens, then at the very least the Olympic flame should not pass through Tibetan territory.
I would also ask you, however, whether we can carry the flame through the whole of Europe with a clear conscience?
In many European countries even today, people still get beaten up because they speak a different language from the majority, minority leaders are given all the blame for a situation that has arisen, and human rights and the rights of communities to self-determination are a taboo subject.
We must speak up for the rights of the Tibetan people, but let Europe also set its own house in order.
<D>
author. - Mr President, can I first of all express my disappointment that the Council is not represented for this important debate.
It is almost a month since elections were held in Zimbabwe.
There can be little doubt that those elections were won by the Movement for Democratic Change.
Mugabe and his henchmen should now be out of office, but we have heard virtually nothing about the election results except that Mugabe's people are once more reacting with violence and are desperately trying to fix the election outcome.
For years now, we have pointed to Zimbabwe as the great shame on the face of Africa, a testimony to the effects of tyranny, corruption and exploitation by one man's appalling regime.
Mugabe has destroyed a once prosperous country.
Yet, during this time, over all those years, other African leaders have stood by and either done nothing or else they have applauded the tyrant whenever they had the opportunity.
What a disgrace!
And what a scandal this has been.
And what a tragedy - not just for the people of Zimbabwe, but for Africa.
For all those years, the first key to Zimbabwe's fate has been held by South Africa, yet Thabo Mbeki has not only failed properly to discharge his responsibilities as a mediator but he has blatantly sided with Mugabe.
The world watched dumbstruck when Mbeki announced a few days ago that there was no crisis in Zimbabwe, just normal electoral politics.
While the EU has at least imposed targeted sanctions on the Mugabe regime, it went out of its way to ensure that no one took them seriously, even inviting Mugabe, banned from travel to EU countries, to its EU-Africa Summit in Lisbon last December for reasons that were wholly false.
What diplomatic or economic effort has really been made to persuade other African countries to do the decent thing over Zimbabwe?
The answer is very little.
Well, there is still time to do the right thing.
Jacob Zuma, the ANC leader, has now called for action on Zimbabwe.
In our motion for a resolution today we are calling on men of goodwill in the governing Zanu-PF in Zimbabwe to see the light and recognise that a transformation is on the way.
Now is the time for us to make our voice heard.
Let us bring about that democratic change that at last is required for the sake of the people of Zimbabwe.
<D>
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (SV) Madam President, this summer may be the first without ice in the Arctic.
Some of the world's biggest glaciers are now sliding from the inland ice in Greenland out into the North Atlantic.
Never before have so much ice and snow melted as over recent years.
I saw it with my own eyes on a visit to Greenland last year.
Everyone, including the experts on the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, are amazed at the melt which is taking place.
This frightening development is of course directly linked to our emissions and to global warming.
It is we in the rich world - the USA, Australia, Japan and of course the EU - who are to blame for this.
That is why we must subject all sectors which contribute to emissions of carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases to a critical examination.
The air transport industry has increased its emissions by around 100% since 1990.
The air transport industry has got off lightly so far.
Aviation fuel is exempt from tax, and local and regional authorities often subsidise airports in Europe.
Here in the EU we fly as never before.
The compromise on which we now have to decide unfortunately falls far short of the necessary action that we in the GUE/NGL Group wanted.
The reduction targets for aviation should have been higher; emissions other than CO2 should have been included; emission rights should not be distributed free of charge.
This is at all events an agreement which is a small step in the right direction.
Aviation will be forced to reduce its emissions, and a small proportion of emission rights must be put out to auction.
The auctioning process will also generate revenue, which will be used for climate measures in Europe and in the developing countries.
Finally I would like to put a question to the Commission: can you give a pledge that countries which want to adopt parallel measures to reduce the emissions from aviation, such as the United Kingdom's Air Passenger Duty, can continue to do so?
<D>
Mr President, I wish to congratulate my colleague, Marco Cappato, on his report.
It is important that we are debating it here in Parliament.
When we speak of accountability and transparency, we must start with ourselves and that means all of the EU institutions.
I agree with much of the report.
I have one or two caveats.
For example, we must ensure that, if we provide information on Members' activities, say, that such information is comprehensive.
Otherwise we will end up knowing the price of everything and the value of nothing.
By this I mean that our workload is really quite broad.
It is not just attendance at committees or plenary.
Any such information on Members' activities would need to include all the activities.
Otherwise some very valuable work that is not concentrated in Parliament could be lost because it would be invisible.
I would like to say regarding my colleague Mr Romagnoli's comments that his good work was not picked up by the media, that it is only news if you do not do your work.
Finally, I would like to say that the core of the matter is that there should be transparency when we are acting in a legislative capacity.
I agree with Michael Cashman that all citizens should know how their ministers vote in Council.
This is crucial.
Otherwise we play into the hands of the 'blame Brussels' brigade when something goes wrong at home.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, on 8 December, the ESDP mission, Operation Atalanta, celebrated one year of existence.
According to the Swedish Presidency, the operation has demonstrated its ability to counter piracy effectively and there has been a significant fall in attacks.
That last statement, however, is highly questionable.
According to a report by the International Maritime Bureau, in the first nine months of 2009, there were more attacks in total than in the whole of 2008.
The number of armed attacks also rose by 200% overall.
The financial efficiency of this operation is also highly questionable.
The cost of damage caused by piracy in this region is estimated to be USD 200 million in total, whereas the EU and its Member States are investing USD 408 million per year.
The new planned ESDP mission in Somalia, once again, will not get to the root of the problem, but merely deal with the symptoms.
What would really be worthwhile would be for the EU to set up an effective coastal watch to prevent illegal fishing ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (HU) Thank you, Mr President.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, opposing discrimination is a fundamental human value; in this regard there is no difference of opinion among us.
The European People's Party attaches particular importance to anti-discrimination policy.
It is our belief that Member States have an incontrovertible and unavoidable responsibility to ensure that not a single citizen of the European Union faces discrimination.
The Group is also aware that not all problems, unfortunately, can be resolved by means of legislation.
In order gradually to put an end to discrimination, we need an appropriate political culture, we need tolerance in daily life, in the workplace, in public life, in communications, from national to local level, and we need the whole of civil society to pull together.
As practice has shown, implementing the European directives on discrimination is no easy task.
Half of the Member States have not managed to transpose the directives adequately into their national legislation or apply them appropriately.
It is a fact that a real gap exists in European legislation between Article 13 of the EC Treaty and the existing directives.
This means that not all 'protected' groups, in other words those referred to in Article 13, are guaranteed equal rights under European law with regard to access to goods and services.
To bridge this gap, however, the European People's Party does not believe the solution lies in adopting a comprehensive directive that would be difficult to implement and inefficient.
Instead, it feels that a European directive is needed as a matter of urgency to help in a non-hierarchical manner to end discrimination against the 84 million disabled people who live in Europe, so that people living with a disability can enjoy the same rights throughout the EU.
Bearing in mind the fact that the average lifespan of the population is increasing and age-related chronic illness often results in damage to a person's health, the number of people living with a disability is set to increase in future.
We are convinced that this approach will provide more effective, practical help to people living with a disability.
The Group would therefore support an initiative of the European Commission with this aim.
Thank you.
<D>
Madam President, can I just first of all warmly welcome Antonio Tajani and congratulate him on his appointment.
It is very important that he is here for this significant debate.
I want to pay tribute first of all to Zita Gurmai, who has done an excellent piece of work, not just in putting this report together but also in promoting the whole of the Intelligent Car eSafety programme.
But I just want to say to the Commission that it is a remarkable example of how a Commission initiative can bring people together across their own services, because as you will know Mrs Reding and her predecessor Mr Liikanen were actively involved in this.
I am pleased to see my friends André Vits and Juhani Jaaskelainen sitting behind the Commissioner, because they have been instrumental in engaging all the participants together and really making progress; and I echo what Robert Evans says, it is a remarkable example of how the European institutions can cooperate together without heavyweight legislation and with a clear vision to move forward.
My only regret today, Mr President - and I hope you will take this up on behalf of Parliament - is that the other principal actors in the whole of the Intelligent Car programme are notably absent from the front row here, because the Council has a crucial responsibility here.
The Member States are responsible in large part for much of the detailed legislation that will help introduce these programmes and help our citizens.
Where are they here to listen to this debate?
I just want to make a couple of remarks to follow up what colleagues have said about the crucial issues of cars and roads.
Let me say to colleagues who have talked about safety features in vehicles that the whole process of evolution of the industry has been one of technological progress; indeed it is true that safety innovations have started first on more expensive cars with lower volumes, and have then trickled down to become available on cheaper cars.
Now all cars sold in the European Union will have anti-lock braking systems.
That is an intelligent system because intelligence, in my view, is collecting and using information.
This is what these systems do.
Once you have that information collection system on, you can then use it for anti-skid systems.
The incremental cost is much lower.
But if we have the eCall system, then we have all cars equipped with that external information-collection system which is what we want to interact with the intelligent highway systems too, where we are also collecting information.
Back in my region - and by the way, Robert Evans, the United Kingdom is now producing cars close to its historic high level and we have more car producers making cars in the United Kingdom than any other European Union country, so please do not run down our car industry - on my local motorway, we have Britain's first intelligent highway which opens lanes and controls speeds according to the traffic flow, and I can tell you that not only does traffic flow more smoothly, but fuel consumption has also been improved: it is a win-win-win situation.
That is what this is all about.
It is about winning by using intelligence and I hope you will all support it.
<D>
on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr President, well, it is all terribly simple really, isn't it?
We have had one vote against the Treaty in Ireland and one vote for the Treaty in Ireland, so if we have any sort of sporting sense, we ought to make this the best of three; but the difference is that with a third referendum, let's make it a free and a fair referendum.
Because what has happened in Ireland most certainly is not that!
In fact, I hope you are all very proud of yourselves because what you have done is you have taken the littlest boy in the playground, got him into the corner and given him a good kicking.
This is a victory for the bully boys; it is a victory for big money and a victory for bureaucrats.
The whole thing was a travesty!
(Heckling)
Oh, so you respect this vote, do you?
You did not respect the last vote, did you?
The European Commission poured in millions of pounds of taxpayers' money - well, pounds or euros, it doesn't matter, though it does in our case because we have still got the pound, thank God! - you poured in millions.
Something like a factor of between 10:1 and 20:1 was the outspending of the 'yes' side to the 'no' side.
The Referendum Commission in Ireland did not do its job, did not tell the Irish people that of course, the Lisbon constitutional treaty has profound impacts on their own constitution; and, perhaps worst of all, the Broadcasting Commission in Ireland changed the rules, so there was not equal coverage for the 'yes' and the 'no' sides.
The whole thing was an outrage.
But what they did campaign on, what you all campaigned on, was 'Vote 'yes' for jobs'.
That was what it was all about.
Well, hot off the press, folks: Aer Lingus have laid people off today and Intel, the people who put EUR 400 000 into the 'yes' campaign, have laid off 300 people today.
One thousand, five hundred and fifty jobs have gone since Saturday; the only jobs that were preserved by the 'yes' vote were the jobs of the political class.
I suspect that it is all over.
I suspect that for Ireland, their period of independence will be a very brief one in their history.
I do not think that President Klaus will be able to hold out, I hope that he does; he is a fine and brave man.
But it looks like we have got the victory of bureaucracy over national democracy.
In historical terms, I think Britain now finds herself very alone, perhaps as she was back in 1940, but...
(Mixed reactions)
...there is a real debate, there is a real debate here.
What is the point of having a Conservative Prime Minister if Mr Blair becomes the overlord?
What is the point of a Foreign Secretary if we have got an EU foreign secretary with his own diplomatic service?
What is the point of any of it?
As far as I am concerned, this Irish referendum begins the real debate.
There is no more pretending: if you want national democracy, you cannot remain a member of this European Union, and we will campaign for Britain to leave and to leave as soon possible.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, I first wish to apologise for the absence of my colleague Stravros Dimas, who wished to take part in this debate but has been prevented from doing so due to a recent serious eye operation.
Ladies and gentlemen, the European Commission wishes to express its deepest regret following the devastation caused by the forest fires in Greece.
Our thoughts are with the victims and their families.
President Barroso travelled to Greece this weekend to size up the situation for himself.
Commissioner Hübner also visited the scene in order to assess to what extent European funds can make a contribution to reconstruction work there, and will report on her visit at tomorrow's College meeting.
Commissioner Dimas, who was in Greece during the initial fires, witnessed the deployment of international assistance for the Greek fire-fighters, and also reported to the College in order to inform the entire Commission about the aid provided and to appeal for all available instruments to be mobilised for rapid reconstruction.
This has been both a human tragedy and an ecological disaster.
The fires have destroyed human lives, homes and the economic framework of an entire nation.
The extent of the damage is considerable: at least 180 000 hectares of land have been burned, and 130 towns and villages devastated.
In the areas most seriously affected, such as the Peloponnese and central and eastern Greece, regional economies were badly hit.
All Europeans were moved by footage of the fires, and Europe was prompted to react and take measures when Greece called for assistance.
The Commission's Monitoring and Information Centre was able to coordinate the assistance offered by 14 Member States, and the international community provided additional fire-fighting assistance, thereby playing a major role in preventing the fires from spreading.
With the assistance of the Commission, Greece's European partners were able to supply specialist airborne assistance with 13 Canadair water bombers and 20 helicopters - this information will be updated on Monday - and fire-fighting units on the ground, vehicles and other facilities.
Particularly valuable assistance was provided by Norway, Switzerland, Serbia, Russia and Israel.
The mission was the largest ever European civil protection operation carried out for a Member State.
Aid was rapid and efficient, a remarkable example of European solidarity.
The damage caused by the fires in Greece was on an exceptional scale, and occurred within a general context of escalation of this type of disaster.
Between July and August this year the Commission received a dozen international assistance calls: from Greece, Cyprus, Italy, Bulgaria, Albania and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
As a general rule the response by Member States was generous and immediate.
The increase in the number of calls for assistance, however, brought about a situation which eventually affected the operational limitations of airborne fire-fighting operations.
The European Union ought to give first priority to the possibility of mobilising additional capacity, and equip itself with extra fire-fighting facilities by approaching either non-EU countries or the private sector.
The Greek Government has estimated the damage at approximately EUR 4 billion, or around 2% of Greek GDP.
The government is drawing up a coherent action plan to redress the situation, and has informed the Commission that it intends to seek assistance from available EU programmes.
The terrible environmental damage caused in Greece is now compounded by the risk of torrential rain running into rivers to hit a weakened ecosystem, and soil erosion causing landslides and water pollution.
A large number of protected zones have been destroyed, and the Commission is now examining how the available funds, and the Life+ Fund in particular, could be mobilised to help restore the habitats destroyed.
The Commissioners have discussed these issues in detail and the Commission has undertaken to take all possible measures to help the Greek Government to cope with the social, environmental and economic consequences of the fires.
One possible instrument available to meet the needs of the Greek people is a reprogramming of the Structural Funds for the regions and programmes directly affected.
Moreover, the Solidarity Fund may be mobilised on the basis of a request submitted by the Greek authorities.
Within this context, the cooperation of Parliament and the Council will be essential to reduce as far as possible the length of the process for the adoption of an amending budget proposed by the Commission with a view to mobilising this Fund.
In relation to the support envisaged by the 2006 operational programmes concerned, as soon as a request for modification is made by the Greek authorities the Commission will examine it with maximum flexibility within the context of the existing regulatory provisions.
Any available credits will be diverted towards meeting the immediate needs of the people and regions affected by the crisis.
A fast-track procedure will be used by the Commission to ensure a rapid decision.
For the period 2007-2013, the Commission will adopt new programmes as planned in October following the request by the Greek authorities.
The programmes may be adopted at a later date depending on the needs identified and the regions and sectors concerned, on the basis of an overall plan presented by the Greek authorities.
With respect to the European Social Fund, we must ask the Greek authorities to include a substantial 'human resources' section in the ongoing action plan.
The plan must cover all areas: employment, inclusion and health, education and training, and public administration reform.
Climate change may bring drier winters and hotter summers, thereby creating an ideal context for fires.
There is now an increasing risk of forest fires, and Europe's response to this tragedy must also take account of the need to reduce the impact of future fires.
Forest management is largely the responsibility of the Member States.
This is understandable since the national governments are in a better position to administer their own territory, invest in fire prevention measures and plan the responses of the emergency services.
There are also many options whereby the EU may provide back-up for national responses in this area.
The Commission intends to draw up a communication on forest fires, and will be examining a number of practical measures that could improve fire prevention and the rebuilding of economies and ecosystems.
Even though the EU response in terms of civil protection was impressive, the Commission feels that it is time to enhance its capacity in this area.
This is an aspect it has been considering since 2006, and in fact President Barroso had already asked Michel Barnier to draw up a report on the matter.
We will carefully examine the recommendations of the Barnier Report when the proposals are submitted.
It is encouraging to see that Parliament has always backed ambitious development of European capacity in terms of civil protection.
Nevertheless, to enable new measures to be adopted, the unanimous support of the Member States must be forthcoming, and this has frequently proved difficult.
In 2006 the Commission proposed using Community funds from the Civil Protection Financial Instrument to provide extra civil protection facilities such as airborne fire-fighting units for large-scale fires.
That is point 9 of that day's resolution almost word for word.
Regrettably a number of Member States do not share this attitude, and the scheme cannot be implemented.
As a result, the Commission urges the Member States to adopt a more ambitious approach when future proposals are submitted to them in this area.

For 50 years, Tibetan refugees have been calling for their fundamental rights to be respected.
I am convinced that respecting these rights and reopening the process of dialogue with the people of Tibet is clearly in China's interest.
In today's world, a country's image is an important part of the way it operates within the global economy, and in terms of international cooperation.
China's refusal to engage in dialogue with the Dalai Lama's representatives, and its rejection of the extremely moderate demands of the Tibetans, is harmful to its image.
Engaging in talks on rights which are in accordance with the principles of the Chinese constitution would not pose any significant risk for China.
In fact, quite the opposite is the case.
Great countries and great nations should be magnanimous.
Such behaviour may provide proof of their greatness.
Engaging in a dialogue with Tibet provides China with an opportunity to show its good, positive, side.
Showing solidarity with Tibet and the Tibetan people is not anti-Chinese.
It is an expression of concern for human rights, religious and linguistic freedom, cultural diversity and the right to maintain one's national identity and autonomy.
Therefore, we are not interfering in China's internal affairs, but merely trying to defend standards and values which are important to us everywhere - in Europe, Asia and throughout the world.
China has not been singled out in any way.
We defend the rights of small nations even when this proves to be bothersome or uncomfortable.
This is because we believe that it is the right approach to take.
(The sitting was suspended at 11.55 a.m. and resumed at 12.05 p.m.)
<D>
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FI) Madam President, Commissioner, first of all I wish to thank the rapporteur, Cem Özdemir, for producing a successful report.
He has worked hard in this area and raised some fundamental issues on the EU and Central Asia strategy.
It is evident from the report that the EU views Central Asia from two standpoints.
The Union wants to increase imports of natural gas and oil from the region and diversify transit routes.
At the same time it wants to improve the human rights situation, promote democracy and equality, and reform systems of governance and the judiciary.
Finding the right balance for these objectives will be a challenging task.
The EU will need to step up the implementation of its Central Asia strategy, speed up the implementation of projects, and broaden its approach both at nation and local level.
I want to emphasise how important it is for there to be dialogue and cooperation between the EU and Central Asia.
At the same time the Union must also support relations between the countries of Central Asia and provide technical assistance for the fight against human and drug trafficking.
EU aid for healthcare, social and educational reforms and cooperation in the field of science will increase the number of contacts in civil society and strengthen European values, democracy, the rule of law and human rights.
This will also pave the way for cooperation in energy policy.
I also want to mention the importance of EU support for basic and further education and training, which will bring with it better opportunities for study in the EU and for exchanges with students from universities in the EU.
The EU also needs to support and encourage the countries of Central Asia to take more effective measures in the area of environmental protection and in their quest for sustainable water use and for their use of other natural resources.
<D>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my group I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Kirkhope, most sincerely.
He has presented a very balanced report and has worked very closely with the shadow rapporteurs.
His version, which he has negotiated with the French Presidency, affords consumers better protection against dubious flight and rail offers based on clear regulations on transparency and at the same time ensures fair competition between rail companies and airlines.
Incidentally, the recast version documents the fact that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats as the first group had rightly stopped the Commission's attempt in 2005 to abolish this regulation as obsolete.
We need it - and we shall prove it by the way we vote - to protect consumers.
Even if more and more travellers do in fact reserve their tickets directly with the airlines or on the Internet, the majority of consumers will continue to rely on their travel agencies, which for their part must be able to rely on non-discriminatory, genuine bargain offers in the computerised reservation system.
The prices indicated must in future include all taxes and charges so that the travel agencies can pass genuinely transparent and comparable offers on to the consumer.
The parent companies should also be subject to tighter regulations on transparency and competition in future in order that the systems are prevented from making preferential offers to the disadvantage of other airlines and to the disadvantage of consumers.
I must come back here to the rapporteur and appeal to my fellow Members.
I believe the version we have agreed with the French Presidency in relation to parent companies offers adequate protection against positive discrimination in favour of certain airlines.
Any change made by the famous amendment to Amendment 48 is therefore totally superfluous and if this goes through tomorrow, it would delay the adoption of the whole thing or even call it into question.
I appeal to you to take a clear, final decision tomorrow in order to protect consumers.
<D>
in writing. - (SV) There are two things that an EU supporter has to explain (if not defend) when he goes home and talks about his work in the EU.
One is Parliament's travelling circus shuttling back and forth to Strasbourg.
The other is the question of subsidies to agriculture.
In both cases the present system is equally impossible to defend - and explain.
There are no good reasons for us to travel to Strasbourg.
There is also no reason why EU taxpayers should subsidise the British Royal Family, which is currently one of the main beneficiaries of the system, while at the same time African producers are excluded.
The Goepel report adopted entirely the wrong approach; I therefore voted against it.
I did so mainly because I think its intentions point in the wrong direction: more direct support, fewer reforms, less market orientation.
The Commission has made a fair amount of progress in changing over to a more up-to-date system of support to agriculture.
It is regrettable that Parliament seems to want to turn the clock back.
<D>
in writing. - I will be supporting this report, strengthening as it does the rules of the European institutions regarding lobbyists.
I was the author of the first report on this subject more than a decade ago, in January 1996, produced by the then Rules Committee, and the legislations we currently have in place regarding lobbyist are those proposed in my original report.
More than 10 years on it is clearly time to modify and strengthen these rules.
We failed last time to have a common system for all of the institutions but this now seems possible.
For me lobbyists are all those who want to come into the Parliament, Commission or Council to influence the decision-making process, whether employers or employees, consumer groups, producer groups or special interest groups.
It is estimated there are around 5 000 lobbyist in Brussels - seven for each and every MEP.
The vast majority do a good job - a very small number do not.
We need to ensure that the few do not taint the many and that our work benefits from outside inputs rather than being distorted by it.
I look forward to the proposals for a 'common legislation' by the end of the year.
<D>
(RO) The report presents both scientific data and recommendations for combating climate change, referring both to adaptation and the reduction in the causes of this problem.
Combating climate change is not only an obligation so that we can guarantee the future for the generations to come, but it is also an opportunity for reviving the global economy.
I urge the importance of energy efficiency to be reflected in both the Community budget and in the financial instruments available.
Making transport more efficient through the use of intelligent transport systems, promoting transport by rail and ship, ensuring intermodal development and investments in greener cars are measures which will help cut the emissions generated by this sector.
I have recommended the development of greener forms of tourism such as sports tourism or cultural tourism.
I would also like to stress that the tourist destinations of excellence should be those which respect and protect the environment.
I feel that we must consider creating an international fund for planting trees on unused landmass.
I would like to end by saying that we need to carry out research in the field of medical science and in the pharmaceutical industry aimed at producing medicines and vaccines which will be available to the entire population affected by certain illnesses at an affordable price.
<D>
President of the Commission. - The task force was for economic governance and, when I was expressing my overall satisfaction with the work so far, I was referring to that.
Of course, growth is a separate issue now.
Growth is the most important point for the European Union economy.
Without growth, we will not be able to deliver to our citizens what they expect.
We will not be able to keep our social market economy.
Our citizens will not be able to realise their full potential.
That is precisely the goal of EU 2020 - growth, growth and growth.
Not just any kind of growth, but intelligent growth, sustainable growth and inclusive growth.
Of course, we believe that to have growth, we need confidence, and unless confidence comes back to the financial markets in Europe, we will not be able to achieve that higher level of growth and restore the growth potential before the crisis.
That is why fiscal consolidation is so important and reforms are so important, not as an end in themselves, but as a means to achieve greater levels of growth to increase the growth potential in Europe.
<D>
in writing. - (FI) Mr President, I respect the clear wish of the President-in-Office of the Council Nicholas Sarkozy to adopt an ambitious attitude towards the EU energy and climate package and to achieve a Convention in that regard during the French Presidency.
I hope this says above all that the challenges of climate change are at last at the heart of policy.
I would, however, like to remind the President-in-Office of the Council of the seriousness of the task - emissions trading is a very significant market tool and affects so many people that we cannot afford to aspire to the kind of political timetable which goes on at the expense of the environment and sustainable development.
Otherwise France may end up with egg on its face, something of which it could not be proud.
Last month I held a seminar at which environmental organisations, research bodies and bodies affected by emissions trading were able to express their views on its economic effects.
The message I received was clear: the Commission proposal will result in much higher costs without providing comparable environmental benefit.
I refer to the worrying McKinsey analysis of the matter.
Emissions trading must be improved.
The situation is serious.
We will not be able to use European industry, which has been dealing with its own affairs well, as a guinea pig again unless the system is operated in a slip-shod fashion.
It is better to fail to accomplish than to accomplish failure.
I believe that we can deliver a good result in time, but some vital adjustments are required.
Carbon emissions will not be prevented by pious hopes and promises, unless they become part of the directive itself.
We should remain firm on reducing the obligation but the procedure is very much open to discussion.
In Parliament we have presented a broad front to the way the Commission has approached the alternatives under consideration.
I would ask that you become acquainted with it, President-in-Office.
<D>
author. - Mr President, it is with great pleasure that I stand up and talk tonight because we are in a situation now where food security has become a real issue.
For 25 years we have been in a situation where there has been plenty of food in Europe.
In fact, we have been taking many decisions in agriculture, in the common agricultural policy, to restrict production in order to maintain prices and reduce the use of export subsidies and to export products on to the world markets.
Now we are facing a situation that is completely different: cereal prices have risen threefold this year; the livestock sector is having a huge problem, having seen its feed costs going up by perhaps 50% or 60%, and we are extremely concerned about this.
Mr Daul, Mr Goepel and I have tabled this oral question - and we are delighted that Commissioner Fischer Boel is here tonight - because we feel we now have to look at every opportunity for getting extra feed into the European Union.
We will have to face up to the reality that there are some feeds that are derived from GM maize and GM soya which cannot come into the European Union at the moment because they are not licensed.
I think we have to make sure that we look at this and that we have a system by which we can license these products.
Provided they are safe, they should come in to be fed to our poultry, and to our pigs in particular, as well as to our cattle, both beef and dairy, because we need to keep a very competitive industry.
We also have to look at the situation regarding supermarkets, because - do not forget - not only are we concerned at the price that the farmer receives for his or her products, but we are also interested in what the consumer has to pay.
There is no doubt that we are seeing, for instance, that only 10% of a loaf of bread is actually made from the raw material of wheat and yet there are huge increases in the price of the loaf because the supermarkets say they are having to pay so much more for wheat.
So we need to put pressure on the supermarkets to make sure that consumers are paying the right price.
It is great that it puts European agriculture in a very strong position to face up to the brave new world, because we will need food production, we will need farmers and we need the countryside, and all these things work very well.
But, as I say, we now have to get the balance right between the cereal and livestock sectors, and that is why we have tabled this question.
We shall be delighted to hear what Commissioner Fischer Boel has to say about it.
<D>
Mr President, although the legal systems of Member States make provision for sanctions against the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography, it is still necessary to raise the level of protection of our children.
It should be emphasised that children who use new technologies, and especially the Internet, are at risk of contact with potential perpetrators of sexual offences.
In connection with the danger which exists, Member States should be called upon to block access to Internet sites which contain child pornography.
This must be a legally binding obligation.
There is also an urgent need to carry out a Europe-wide campaign to make parents and teenagers aware of the dangers of child pornography on the Internet.
Supporting the victims of this reprehensible business, and of their families, is also an important matter.
They are often left without help.
It is our obligation to give the best possible protection to our children.
<D>
In order to achieve an EU-Middle East agreement, the attempt to restore stability, and assistance in realising the peace programme in the Gaza Strip, should, for the present, continue to be the priority.
The European Union should also do everything in its power to bring about an end to the dispute in which innocent citizens are losing their lives.
Furthermore, efforts should concentrate on bringing assistance to people, on ensuring that they have the basic means to live.
The population of the Gaza Strip have only 60% of their daily food needs available, which means that they are even more at risk of disease and exposed to difficult conditions.
The lack of drinking water constitutes no less a threat than the lack of food.
I do not, I think, need to mention the lack of medical care or the destruction of schools and public institutions, which is significantly hindering the establishment of order and a return to normality.
We should remember that only when many basic problems of everyday life have been solved will we be able to concentrate on the economic development of the Middle East and on close commercial cooperation with the region.
The European Union has an opportunity to help the Arab world, and all the countries of the Middle East, to become a region where prosperity prevails, which will, in turn, create a framework for closer cooperation between the Middle East and the EU.
<D>
in writing. - (RO) Support for the proposal of a European Parliament resolution on policy actions at the European Union level on organ donation and transplantation.
I request that the European Commission propose a more comprehensive directive that would set quality and safety requirements for the donation and transport of organs in the European Union.
This directive would also provide methods of preventing potential abuse.
The new legislative act should supplement and strengthen the Member States' efforts to improve the present situation, imposing lines of conduct at a European level, by taking into account the progress in medicine.
I insist on Member State involvement, including the Member State I come from, Romania, in educating citizens by presenting the advantages of organ donation and acknowledging the fact that organ donation and transplantation mean lives saved.
I also support the involvement of the European Commission in organizing public debates together with the relevant European non-governmental organizations, in order to identify the best solutions, both as regards the communication campaign and the turning to account of the Member States' experience and good practice.
The response speed is essential in such cases.
Better organization of the medical system at a national level is necessary, as well as making paramedics sensitive to such emergencies
<D>
(DE) Mr President, Mr Nassauer, the right to self-determination is a human right and that includes sexual self-determination.
To that extent it was already topical in 2008 and what was said is particularly unfortunate.
I will read Amendment 2 aloud.
On the one hand, it is about a correction of fact and, on the other, a somewhat more balanced formulation:
'Underlines the importance of promoting sexual and reproductive health rights, as a precondition for any successful fight against HIV/AIDS, which causes enormous loss in terms of human lives and economic development, affecting particularly the poorest regions in the world; is concerned about declarations made by Pope Benedict XVI, which create the impression that condom use could even lead to an increased risk of contagion; is of the opinion that those statements will severely hamper the fight against HIV/AIDS;'.
The remainder of the amendment remains unchanged.
(Applause from the left)
<D>
Madam President, two years' work and my congratulations to all of you on this hard work.
The telecoms package makes a major contribution to the Lisbon Strategy as the sector represents 4% of GDP and 25% of GDP growth.
It is one of the basic sectors for European economic power.
The telecoms package makes a major contribution to a knowledge-based economy, not only through the sector itself, but also by increasing opportunities for users, whether they be companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, or individuals.
Everyone can benefit from it.
The telecoms package makes a major contribution to the European Economic Recovery Plan through its development of the network.
The telecoms package makes a major contribution to strengthening consumer rights and consumer opportunities as more and more consumers can use it.
The telecoms package also, however, makes a major contribution to the development of democracy.
It provides access to all Europeans and new means to practise our rights and obligations, but is also a balance established by the regulatory body: a balance between giving Europe an instrument to achieve a truly internal market in the telecoms sector, and using the expertise available at national regulatory level.
My congratulations to the rapporteurs and to the Commission.
Over the next five years, we shall make the first step, which then has to be followed by others.
<D>
Mr President, I will use my speech to propose a reform of the way we deal with the annual programmes.
Until now the elected members of national parliaments and the European Parliament had no say.
The annual programme is initiated and adopted by the non-elected in the Commission.
Member States coordinate their priorities through the working programmes of the shifting presidencies.
We discuss both; we amend nothing.
We do not represent our voters in the very important agenda-setting function.
Instead, we should insist on one joint working programme for all institutions in the next year.
The Commission could draft a detailed proposal with annexes of all proposals for laws they intend to propose, including their legal base.
Then the national parliaments should deal with it in their sectoral committees for a first reading, then in their European committees and finally in their plenaries.
National parliaments should meet in COSAC and formally adopt the working programme.
Parliament should have its own readings, and then the European Union would be governed bottom-up instead of top-down.
It would be directed by elected representatives of our peoples instead of being governed by civil servants and lobbyists behind closed doors.
When the programme is adopted, the national parliaments could then start the reading of the concrete proposals for 'subsidiarity and proportionality' and decide the legal base.
Then the European institutions could take over, and all laws could be passed - both in the Council, with the support of 75% of the Member States, and in the European Parliament, with the normal majority.
Then Europe would be a democracy, instead of the mixture of the ideas of Machiavelli and Mussolini we build on today.
<D>
Mr President, the ratification of the renamed EU Constitution threatens the democratic legitimacy of the European project itself.
The peoples of France and Holland rejected the Constitution, yet it has now come back with a new name and with what Angela Merkel called 'cosmetic changes'.
Now the institutions and the Member States, including the Labour Government in the UK, are dishonestly pretending that these cosmetic changes justify breaking their promise of a referendum.
They do not, and the pretence that they do is a huge breach of faith with the people.
In Britain a campaign group has just undertaken an independently monitored postal ballot in 10 Westminster constituencies.
Over 150 000 voters responded: 88% wanted a referendum; 89% opposed the Treaty.
In six constituencies more people voted for a referendum than voted for their current Member of Parliament.
The people have spoken.
The Treaty cannot be legitimate without their consent.
The European Council must listen.
We must have a referendum.
<D>
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first of all to thank the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs for agreeing to accept the procedure laid down in Article 91 and to put this emergency resolution on last Monday's agenda, since, at our last plenary here, in Strasbourg, we already had an emergency resolution on this issue of Sri Lanka.
I would also like to thank Parliament for having agreed to this debate taking place this evening, and I thank you, Commissioner, for coming to this debate, as I know the time is difficult for you.
We wanted this resolution because we have to send a strong political signal to the government and the Tamil representatives in Sri Lanka, because the situation is getting worse every day.
We have first hand accounts from Tamil families and people who are in Europe and who are always sending us messages and accounts of what is happening to them and what is happening to their families trapped in the conflict between the Tamil Tigers and the Sri Lankan army.
These people are enduring really terrible suffering.
We do not know how many people are affected, but we estimate that between 150 and 200 000 people need to be evacuated.
What is meant by 'evacuated', though?
The NGOs are asking us to have them evacuated by sea, but, there again, I have to ask: to go where?
Where are these people going to go?
This afternoon, I met a little girl who was born in a Sri Lankan refugee camp and who is now in Europe.
If it is that these people have to leave their country to go and live in refugee camps, then that is not the solution, either.
Therefore, we are asking in this resolution for there to be an actual ceasefire.
Of course, there will be debate with the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats about an immediate or temporary ceasefire.
We are really asking the authorities for an immediate ceasefire so that civilians can be removed from danger, because we know that there are people who have been killed.
We have had another example of this today with these testimonies.
We are asking, of course, in this resolution, for the Sri Lankan Government to cooperate with the NGOs and with countries that are willing to help to resolve this conflict.
We are also asking if the European Union can help to deliver desperately needed food and medicines.
Finally, may I say on behalf of my group - since it is on the initiative of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance that we tabled this emergency resolution on Monday in the Committee on Foreign Affairs - that we are asking for this issue to be taken very seriously by some of our fellow Members, who have different interests in this country.
I would remind you that, for a long time now, some of the political groups have been asking for the opportunity to speak about the situation in Sri Lanka and that, for internal reasons in some countries, we have not been able to debate this issue of the Tamils and their situation, which has deteriorated since the 1980s.
Since you are here with us, Commissioner, maybe we can ask ourselves another question.
The European Union appears to have the ability to help in resolving conflict.
Perhaps the time has come for us to consider the possibility of setting up a conflict resolution unit within the European Union.
We can see in the Caucasus, we can see everywhere else in the world that the European Union is taken seriously for the proposals that it issues.
In resolving conflict today, we must no longer be just a supportive participant, but an actual promoter of conflict resolution.
If, today, we can start to lay the foundations to resolve this conflict with a strong European Union presence and a strong message to the authorities, I believe that we will have also increased our stature in terms of political union.
<D>
President-in-Office. - (SL) I have understood that the common mood of the participants in this debate is support for the code to become legally binding as soon as possible.
I should add that the Presidency shares this objective and I hope, Mr Pflüger, that this year we will have more luck and succeed in achieving it or at least, as I said in the introduction, make major progress in this direction.
I would like to thank you for your support of the Council's endeavours to reach a common position, and you can trust that the Slovenian Presidency will strengthen its efforts to this end.
I would like to thank Mrs Gomes, who pointed out that there is an attempt to include new players in the implementation of the code, namely those outside the European Union borders.
The previous Presidencies, for example in 2007, included countries of the western Balkans, in particular, in these activities.
There are also activities relating to other countries, such as Turkey, Ukraine, north African countries and some other eastern European countries.
I will end by expressing my hope that, in the next debate of this topic in the European Parliament, the discussion will not be just about the code, but also about the common position.
<D>
Thank you, Mr President.
I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Hammerstein, on the report he has drafted and the work he has done on it.
The last Eurobarometer opinion poll at EU level shows that the European Parliament is the institution most trusted by European citizens.
In fact, 52% of Europeans trust the European Parliament, which is more than the percentage who trust the European Commission (47%), more than the percentage who trust their national parliament (trusted by only 34%), and also more than the percentage who trust their national government (trusted by only 32% of EU citizens).
I feel that we should increase this trust that is placed in the European Parliament.
The fact remains that the European Parliament is the institution most trusted by EU citizens.
I think that this results from the fact that the Members of this Parliament are directly elected by the people; it also results from the fact that the Treaty recognises the citizen's right to make a complaint, to present a petition to this Parliament for its consideration.
This is in fact the work that is performed by the Committee on Petitions, which is therefore a very important committee because it gives voice to the people and is therefore the committee, among the 20 committees in this Parliament, that is close to the people.
What can we do to improve this situation?
I think that we should increase awareness of this committee and of the possibility for citizens to petition.
Here I disagree with the rapporteur that there is sufficient awareness; I think that 1 500 petitions are too little when you consider that we represent a continent of half a billion people.
Moreover, we have to increase awareness and the possibility for citizens to complain, to petition.
We need more simplification so that it is easier for citizens to make a complaint.
That is why we are asking in this report that the Secretary-General of the European Parliament negotiate with the European Commission to simplify the petition.
We also want more efficiency, because we feel that there is too much of a delay in the consideration of complaints.
To say the least, we take three months to register people's petitions or complaints; this delay is unacceptable.
Lastly, we want a more effective remedy.
We want there to be more cooperation before the start of legal proceedings and we want national representatives to be present too when our citizens' complaints are heard.
Thank you very much.
<D>
(After the speech by Mrs Harms, see item 4.1).
Yes, Mrs Harms.
Regarding the matter that you have just mentioned, I must inform the House that President Buzek has made a public statement, which I will read to you.
It is with great sadness that I have learned of the tragic death of Natalia Estemirova, who was abducted earlier today in Grozny.
On behalf of the European Parliament, I would like to express our sympathy and condolences to the family and friends of the deceased.
Natalia Estemirova was a human rights activist and a leading researcher, with Memorial, on Chechnya.
In 2005 she was awarded the Robert Schuman Medal by the EPP Group in the European Parliament.
We in the European Parliament have appreciated her work in the fields of human rights, promoting democratic accountability and the implementation of the rule of law.
We strongly call on the authorities of the Russian Federation to start a fully fledged inquiry into her death and to do their utmost to bring those responsible for this tragic death to justice.
The European Parliament is at the forefront of promoting democracy, implementing the rule of law and defending human rights.
It is, therefore, our obligation to support and show our solidarity with all those who struggle everywhere in the world for the same values, as was the case with Natalia Estemirova.
(Applause)
Ms Harms, the Presidency agrees with your proposal to hold a minute's silence in memory of Natalia Estemirova.
(The House observed a minute's silence)
<D>
(HU) True dialogue between cultures and peoples exists when all are free to use their mother tongue and exercise their individual or collective rights.
Today and tomorrow the European Parliament is expressing solidarity with the Tibetan people.
More than 500 people have joined the silent demonstration on behalf of the freedom of Tibetans to use their mother tongue, practise their religion and enjoy true autonomy.
Within the EU there are traditional ethnic minorities which are unable to study or use their mother tongue freely, and which lack cultural or territorial autonomy.
What is more, there are countries which have reintroduced the notion of collective guilt, reminiscent of the Second World War, or countries which still want to rely on the Communist laws of the 1940s to guarantee the rights of traditional ethnic minorities.
The EU's action on behalf of the minorities living on Chinese territory can be effective if ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
<D>
(PT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in 1848 Karl Marx proclaimed Socialism for the 19th century, and it was a disaster.
In 1917 Lenin, with the Russian Revolution, proclaimed Socialism for the 20th century, and it was a disaster.
Various Members of this House emerged from that disaster to join us in freedom.
The problem with Socialism for the 21st century, as proclaimed by President Chávez in Venezuela, is that this century is only just beginning and we do not know what will happen.
However, we can imagine that, as in the 19th and 20th centuries, it will also be a disaster.
As a matter of fact, we see it resulting in violence.
It is not the elections that concern us; it is the brutal violence perpetrated by the authorities against the students protesting in Venezuela because they are not recognised as having the right to demonstrate.
Some of these students have died in recent days on the streets of Caracas and other cities.
It is the threats to freedom of expression that concern independent and free journalists throughout Latin America and in particular in Venezuela and which led to the closure of Radio Caracas Televisión.
This is the line that concerns us, and we are right to be concerned as, in the constitutional reform proposed by President Chávez, words such as 'decentralisation', 'private initiative', 'freedom of competition' and 'social justice' have given way to words such as 'Socialism', 'Socialist', 'imposition of the Socialist State', 'elimination of the independence of the Central Bank' and 'people's power'.
It is well-known throughout the world that, when someone uses the expression 'people's power', power will be taken away from the people and democracy will be destroyed.
This has happened everywhere that the expression 'people's power' has been used.
'Bolivarian Armed Forces', 'communes', this is the kind of line that should concern us, that has sown instability and violence in recent months and years on the streets of Caracas and that also represents a threat to regional stability if what has recently happened in relations between Venezuela and Colombia should continue.
That is why it is essential that we closely monitor events in Venezuela in solidarity with the democratic parties and civil society fighting for regional stability and firmly defending democracy, but also with great cohesion in the European Union's diplomacy.
<D>
- (PL) In discussion of the conflict between Russia and Georgia, we tend to overlook what happened in Abkhazia rather than in Ossetia.
In fact, something very significant happened in Abkhazia.
The Russians do have some grounds for arguing that their action, albeit disproportionate, was in response to an effort to resolve the problem of Ossetia by military means.
Where Abkhazia is concerned, however, nothing of the sort happened.
The mass incursion by Russian troops, the appearance of the fleet along the Georgian coast, and the military conquest of the territory controlled by the Georgian authorities all demonstrate that Russia is prepared to use its fighting forces on the pretext of taking preventive action.
Accordingly, such action must be classed amongst those justified solely by a one-sided assessment of foreign policy resources.
In his statement, President Medvedev returned to the notion of a common area of security stretching from Vancouver to Vladivostok.
I put it to you, ladies and gentlemen, how can one rely on joint action in this common area of security if Russia demonstrates that it is itself a source of threats?
Regarding the other issues President Medvedev would like to see included in the potential agreement, we should recall that they are all already contained in the agreement currently in force.
This agreement was adopted in 1990 and is entitled the Paris Charter for a New Europe.
Of course, perhaps what is really at issue here is not dialogue but the right of veto in relation to various actions NATO may undertake.
(Applause)

(NL) Madam President, I am delighted that the Council and Commission are issuing a statement about the economic and social impact of present demographic trends.
Many politicians have a bad habit of thinking in the short term and of neglecting long-term policy.
Our demographic challenge is a vital problem in the long term, which also requires long-term solutions.
The average birth rate in women in the European Union is 1.5, which is too low to replace the current generations.
This is also where the problem lies.
One option is to reach out for an easy solution in the short term by pleading in favour of an even greater immigration wave from outside Europe.
Whilst this may seem like a good idea in theory, day-to-day reality in our big cities bears witness to the total failure of lax immigration policy over the past 30 years.
The European unemployment figure is 20 million, and still the Commission would like to import more immigrants.
Might I, in fact, point out that the unemployment percentage among non-European immigrants is considerably higher than among the native people in the Member States?
A lack of time prevents me from mentioning the social problems, including the social breakdown, which large-scale immigration causes.
What we need is policy in the Member States that supports young European families in their desire to have children.
Tax measures are needed in the Member States in order to make having children more attractive.
Child care should be improved and extended.
We should also dare to contemplate the introduction of a wage for the stay-at-home-parent who chooses to commit most of his or her time to raising the children.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, thank you very much for this debate.
I feel a very powerful support for the Commission proposal to grant visa freedom to the citizens of Bosnia and Albania and I think that is a very good thing.
Hopefully, there will be a big majority tomorrow in the plenary and that will send a signal to the people of these two countries that the elected Members of the European Parliament strongly support their wish to travel more freely in the European Union.
I can reassure you once again that the benchmarks have been met.
We have been monitoring very closely.
We will, of course, remain in contact and monitor this, but they have been fulfilled.
All countries must be treated equally.
The benchmarks are clear and are very transparent.
The process has been as transparent as possible.
A few words on Kosovo before I end.
Kosovo is not forgotten.
Kosovo is, of course, also a very important partner in this.
They have made a lot of progress but still, in order to be credible, the Commission has to watch over all the benchmarks and all the conditions if we want to have credibility and legitimacy for this process.
Kosovo is not ready.
We are working with them.
I know that they are making great efforts on the government side on readmission and on the reintegration of forced returnees.
They need to do more.
Once these conditions are met, we are, of course, ready to enter into a more formal visa dialogue with them.
In the meantime, we can only encourage Member States to use all the facilities provided by the revised visa code when they are addressing the visa applications submitted by Kosovo citizens.
So, rapporteur, thank you for this very fruitful and very encouraging debate and I look forward to a very strong vote tomorrow in plenary.
<D>
(NL) Madam President, in June 2009 I was elected to the European Parliament by European citizens.
I was not elected to a parliament of institutions, nor was I elected to a parliament of individual Member States.
I am pointing that out because European citizens have many questions about Schengen.
This is nothing to do with populism, nor is it to do with fear.
This is to do with the questions which are worrying European citizens: how are we dealing with Schengen?
Many questions are being asked about this at the moment, and I therefore call your attention to this.
Obviously, if the President of the Commission says that we have to uphold the principle of free movement of persons, then I will support that.
25,000 Tunisians cannot be allowed to take 502 million Europeans hostage, but these questions will not go away and public support for Schengen in Europe will be jeopardised.
That is why I can also agree to temporary border check arrangements, as my fellow member Mr Iacolino suggested.
I am very well aware that we cannot get burden-sharing up and running at the first attempt.
Finally, Madam President, one more question: what is the state of play when it comes to the launch of the European Asylum Support Office in Malta?
I have heard that there is still a possibility of it getting off the ground.
Perhaps, the Commissioner could explain once again when the Office will actually be up and running.
<D>
Mr President, I am very proud to have been at the launch at Sadler's Wells in 2001 of the campaign for the Convention.
I am very proud that Members across this Parliament have played a leading role in supporting the creation of the Convention.
I am very proud to have been with the Human Rights Subcommittee in Geneva at the Human Rights Commission and Council to lobby for its agreement.
I am very proud that the European Commission and the European Communities have signed up to a human rights instrument for the first time.
I am very proud that it is the swiftest-agreed convention in the history of the United Nations, but most of all I am very proud that disabled people and disabled people's organisations have played a full part in its consideration and its agreement.
Our support for ratification this week should make clear three points.
Firstly, in becoming the eighth ratifier, the European Union is saying to the EU Member States that they too should ratify and implement, including the optional protocol.
Secondly, Commissioner, we and the European Commission, across all its competencies, should screen existing policies and procedures to make sure that we comply with the Convention and act accordingly.
(The President cut off the speaker.)
<D>
The next item is the President's statement on the situation in Gaza.
The chairs of the political groups will outline their respective positions on this issue.
They have, however, asked me to make a statement too, and I have gladly acceded to their request.
In view of the escalation in the Middle East, there was an urgent need to put the current situation on the agenda once more.
We Europeans are again asking ourselves what we can do, how we are to react to the spiral of violence that is causing the Middle East to flare up once again before our eyes.
To come straight to the point, the only response is the resolute pursuit and emphatic fast-tracking of the peace talks between the Israelis and the Palestinians.
The peace process launched in Annapolis must not be destroyed by violence and terrorism.
As Members of the European Parliament, we must do everything in our power to prevent that.
The television images of victims of the conflict that reach us daily are harrowing.
If we were moved to sympathy and outrage a week ago by the sight of the innocent Palestinian civilians, including many children, who lost their lives in Gaza because of the disproportionate use of military force, since last Thursday's appalling murderous attack on a school in Jerusalem we have been sharing the sadness and anger of the Israeli population.
Sympathy is a noble virtue in politics too, but sympathy is not enough.
Sympathy is no substitute for political action.
Viable political solutions must be found rationally on the basis of clear principles.
The protection of human life and respect for international law are embodiments of such principles, and they must therefore be our benchmarks.
On behalf of the European Parliament I strongly condemn the acts of violence perpetrated by Hamas and other Palestinian extremists.
On behalf of the European Parliament I ask the Government of Israel to listen to the voices both within the country itself and beyond its borders that are calling on it to match its rhetoric with actions designed to promote peace.
The Gaza Strip has become the running sore of the Middle East.
To some people it is a thorn in the flesh, because extremists are in political control there.
Many would like to turn their backs on it, to detach the Gaza Strip from the rest of the world and pretend it did not exist.
Behind the walls that already exist there and those that are currently being built along the Egyptian border live people - men, women and children who have the right to decent living conditions - and people do not tolerate walls and divisions for ever.
People are afraid.
We sympathise deeply with the population of places like Sderot and Ashkelon who live in daily fear of new mortar attacks.
We take Israel's security very seriously, and we shall always defend it.
The European Parliament and I myself, during my visit at the end of May 2007 to Israel and the Palestinian territories, including the Gaza Strip, have repeated that message countless times.
Mortar attacks on Israel from the Gaza Strip must stop.
That kind of resistance is terrorism, and it is non-negotiable as far as we are concerned.
Yet while people's emotions are being ruled by fear, death is final, and no one can bring back the hundreds of people whose lives have been sacrificed to Israel's security needs since the Gaza Strip was sealed off.
We must question the proportionality and the expedience of this approach.
We must also ask whether it is consistent with international law that the population of any territory should suffer for the extremism of their leaders.
Providing the population of Gaza with minimal humanitarian aid and otherwise ignoring them cannot be a durable and viable solution.
The European Union is helping to alleviate distress with its humanitarian assistance, but its priority must now be to make a greater long-term political investment so that its financial generosity is channelled in the most strategically desirable direction.
At the donors' conference in Paris last December, where the European Parliament was also represented, the European Union pledged EUR 540 million for 2008 to support the process launched in Annapolis.
The new Pegase funding mechanism is already operating.
The European Parliament wants the European Union to lend vigorous support and assistance to the peace process.
As the budgetary authority, however, we must ensure that our financial commitment does not miss its target.
All parties will have to realise that the European Union cannot have military actions destroying the fruits of our financial solidarity.
It is the will of the European Parliament to work hard, as an honest broker, for a solution to the Middle East conflict.
Our new working group on the Middle East intends to contribute to the pursuit of that goal.
In two weeks' time, together with the follow-up group of the Paris donors' conference, comprising the French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner, the Norwegian Foreign Minister Jonas Gahr Støre, Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner and Tony Blair, Special Envoy of the Middle East Quartet, we shall be discussing progress in the actual delivery of our aid.
If the European Union is to act as an honest broker, even-handedness is imperative.
However, if we focus on the constant diplomatic struggle to describe the escalation in Israel and Gaza in an even-handed manner, we are liable to forget that people, not words, are meant to be at the heart of our policies.
What is termed the Annapolis Process must not be used as a smokescreen behind which the settlement policy remains in place and the Palestinian territories continue to be sealed off with countless security zones that restrict people's freedom of movement.
The situation of the Palestinian population cannot improve unless people can move freely in Gaza and the West Bank.
Without freedom of movement, the establishment of a stable Palestinian state is inconceivable.
Security has more than just a military dimension.
Security cannot be achieved unless people in Israel and Palestine acknowledge and respect each other.
Security begins with reconciliation.
The time has come to sow the seeds of lasting reconciliation between Palestinians too.
Hamas must alter its position and work alongside moderate Palestinians to build peace.
Once again I declare our support for President Mahmud Abbas and Prime Minister Salam Fayyad.
One of the keys to success is an arrangement on the crossing points along the border of the Gaza Strip, with high priority attaching to a rapid solution for cross-border traffic at the Karni and Rafah crossings.
This is an area where the European Union bears special responsibility too.
Ladies and gentlemen, let us do everything in our power to back up our financial commitment with consistent political action so that we can contribute to peace in the Middle East and, above all, give our support to the people of the Middle East.
(Applause)
<D>
Vice-President of the Commission. - (IT) Mr President, I believe that today an important goal has been achieved, and that is the goal of launching a debate on body scanners, in order to understand whether this is an issue that needs to be addressed or not.
It seems to me that the debate has shown there is a clear will to discuss the issue.
With regard to the method, and partly because of what has been decided with the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon - and I hope that it will later be adopted by all the EU countries - I realise that Parliament wants to have its say, and wants to feel that it is a full legislator.
I have only abided by the current rules.
I do not have the authority to modify comitology; that is not within my powers.
I can only have a report and ensure that Parliament is always involved in any case when there is a debate on an important issue, and also say whether a debate on the issue ought to take place.
The workshop that we have arranged for 6 November, which will include representatives of the Member States and MEPs, will be an opportunity - not that it is the only one, since it might be the first of a series of specific meetings - to assess all aspects of the use of body scanners, starting with what I consider to be the most important, human health.
We will then tackle all the other problems relating to the possible non-mandatory use of this instrument, with the consensus of Parliament at the time.
I do not wish to impose anything on anyone: I just want to assess possibilities.
I say again that I believe that it is right to do this with Parliament, with the commitment that I have made - and I repeat it now, at the conclusion of this debate - to officially consult the European Data Protection Supervisor and listen to the views of the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights.
As far as I am concerned, if after all the evaluations, on which I will report to Parliament, it is decided to go ahead with the choice of using body scanners, as far as the European Commission is concerned, my commitment is that body scanners - and I can guarantee this and I say it once again - will never be made compulsory and an alternative to them must always be provided by the airports.
If there is a European regulation then it must be on these terms: then, of course, if the laws are infringed it is clear that there will be consequences.
If a legal provision is adopted, if we have a European regulation, then as far as the Commission is concerned one may agree or disagree, but that is the way things are.
I make a commitment to do something: then if someone does not believe what I say and thinks it cannot be done.
Otherwise we will not do anything.
As far as the images are concerned, they will not be recorded and they will never be stored.
Thus it will only be a sort of walk through, given everything that will have to be done first.
Should a decision be taken to use body scanners as an optional tool, the images will never be recorded or stored.
That point will be in the text of the European Commission's regulation.
If anyone subsequently breaks the rules, then the European Commission will take the appropriate measures.
The same goes for any provision, and any criminal code.
If anyone breaks a law then they incur the penalties laid down by the criminal code.
Today there is a manual body search: any official who touches a citizen inappropriately is violating their privacy and breaking the rules, and is thus not abiding by the law.
The official will certainly be charged and found guilty, after a proper legal process.
Above all, I undertake to take great pains on the issue of health.
I believe that all these guarantees must and can be assessed afterwards by Parliament, which I intend to consult again at successive stages, starting with the workshop to be held on 6 November.
This will be a meeting where MEPs will be able to put questions, say what they think and raise any queries, including technical ones.
I can give guarantees of a political nature, but not of a technical nature.
We need the technical experts to respond.
After the technical assessments, we will be able to give a response on that point.
The MEPs who have been invited to the workshop will also participate in the assessment.
I therefore believe that I am in agreement with what was said in particular by Mr Fava and Mr Cappato on this point.
A general consensus can be reached, which will be a joint assessment as to whether or not it is advisable in the future to use this technological tool.
If it proves not to be possible to use it because the relevant criteria have not been met, then it will not even be included in the list of possible tools to use.
If we were to come up with a positive verdict, after all the steps that I have promised to carry out, then the text of the regulation would contain all the guarantees that I have undertaken to incorporate into it, as I have said both in my opening remarks in response to the question and in my concluding reply.
This is a commitment, and I am used to keeping to my commitments, above all those made to a Parliament of which I was a part for nearly 15 years.
<D>
on behalf of the ITS Group. - (FR) Mr President, the European authorities, and in particular the Kacin report, generally seem to treat Serbia not as a sovereign state but as a naughty schoolboy, a ne'er-do-well, someone the European Union has the right to give good marks and bad marks to.
Serbia gets good marks when it acquires a government that is described as being pro-European.
This pro-European reference of course means being liable for and subject to the dogma that pertains in Brussels.
It gets bad marks when the Serbs prove less than enthusiastic about collaborating with the International Criminal Tribunal.
Here it is useful to recall that this Tribunal has scorned two principles that in fact go to the heart of our justice system: the legal sovereignty of states and freedom of expression.
As a result, Vojislav Seselj, the leader of the Serbian Radical Party that represents 28% of the electorate, has been imprisoned in The Hague since February 2003 and is still awaiting a verdict, even though he turned himself in voluntarily.
This Tribunal is therefore blatantly violating the very principles that have been declared by the European Union, namely respect for fundamental freedoms and human rights.
To tell the truth, Mr Seselj's only crime is to be a Serbian patriot.
The rulers of the European Union, who wish to break up the nations of Europe, cannot in fact forgive the Serbs for having resisted the destruction of their state, and in particular the secession of Kosovo, the historic heart of Serbia.
The treatment inflicted on the Serbs in Kosovo is a warning to all the peoples of Europe.
If today the Albanians are calling for the establishment of a Kosovar state, it is because immigration from Albania and the falling birth-rate among Serbs have given them a majority in a province where, some fifty years ago, they were in the minority.
The Kosovan example should compel us more than ever to reaffirm the right of the peoples of Europe to be themselves and to make their own decisions, in other words to preserve their identity and sovereignty, and in an enlarged European Europe of nations and homelands there should also clearly be a legitimate place for the people of Serbia.
<D>
Mr President, I welcome Ms Ferreira's excellent work and cooperation, thanks to which we have before us a report that gives a comprehensive and honest appraisal of the potential and limitations of market-based instruments.
Market instruments clearly have a role to play.
Making economic logic align with environmental and social reality by applying the 'polluter pays' principle should be a powerful way of steering patterns of production and consumption towards sustainability.
For example, if the true environmental and social costs of freight transport were internalised within prices paid along the supply chain, we might finally see an end to the madness that sees more or less identical products being pointlessly traded back and forth between distant countries.
Applying such principles at the level of individuals via a system of personal carbon trading could be an extremely effective way of influencing consumer behaviour.
But, as Ms Ferreira's report rightly makes clear, market instruments must not be seen as a replacement for other forms of environmental standards and regulation.
Their usefulness also depends crucially on the way in which they are designed.
The emissions trading system is a case in point.
I would like to warn colleagues that, if we listen to a lot of what the industry is telling us, we will end up with a scheme that is no more than trading backwards and forwards for the sake of trading, as we have seen with the first two phases, completely losing sight of any environmental objectives.
To be effective, the scheme has to have a tough cap deriving from the 30% emissions reduction target, restrictions on the entry of outside credits and full auctioning of allowances from the outset.
Finally, I would like to mention one other welcome thread running through the report - the recognition that traditional economic growth as measured by GDP is no longer an adequate or accurate measure of true well-being.
A conference was held on this topic in Parliament earlier this year and I look forward to the Commission's report in the autumn.
<D>
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission, and I personally, wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Vakalis, for this extremely informative and valuable report.
Earthquakes are not easy to deal with.
There needs to be adequate preparation and sufficient measures must be taken in advance so that we can cope with the most serious effects.
2007 was an important year for developing ways of dealing with natural disasters at EU level.
Not only did we have the largest single mobilisation of the EU civil protection mechanism to fight the Greek forest fires, but two new legislative measures on civil protection were adopted: the financial instrument for civil protection, and a revised European civil protection mechanism.
In addition, as announced in September and following the European Parliament's resolution on forest fires and floods, the Commission is to launch a special initiative to strengthen the EU's capacity to deal with disasters.
A rapid and effective response to emergencies is obviously of crucial importance, particularly for risks such as earthquakes, which are practically impossible to foresee.
However, even when unforeseen events occur, an effective response can and must be supplemented by suitable preventive measures, such as early warning, to limit potential damage and enable the situation to be brought under control.
For these reasons, in 2008 the Commission will develop a complete initiative to improve disaster prevention generally.
After response and prevention, the third stage in the management of disasters such as earthquakes is restoration.
In this context, I welcome Parliament's call for the Council to promote the proposal on the Solidarity Fund.
The financial instrument for civil protection provides a long-term funding framework for civil protection such as earthquake response operations.
The new regulation has almost doubled the funds available.
The Commission also has special plans for dealing with earthquake-related issues and, thanks to the capital allocated by the European Parliament to the EU budget in 2006, the Commission is already supporting the STEP project.
This project is being implemented through a partnership between Italy, Portugal and Germany and aims to develop a mobile assessment and administration unit for earthquake management.
The Commission endorses the appeal by the rapporteur, Mr Vakalis, for better coordination.
The events of last summer have shown that although the EU civil protection response was impressive, there is still room for improvement.
On the basis of the recommendations of the Barnier report, the Commission is now developing ready-formed civil protection units composed of disaster response experts that can be mobilised instantly.
Lastly, the rapporteur, Mr Vakalis, underlines the importance of cooperation with third countries.
The civil protection mechanism allows cooperation with third countries and with the Euromed programme in the prevention, mitigation and management of natural and man-made disasters and is another good example of cooperation in this sector.
<D>
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (GA) Mr President, the EU's leaders are assembled in Brussels for a European Council meeting on the day after the signing of the new Reform Treaty.
Ireland is one of the countries where the provisions of the Treaty will be put to a referendum; if the campaign in support of the Treaty is run on a visibly professional footing, I believe that the referendum will prove to be a great success.
And, further to what Mr Schulz said about the dangers of a negative coming from Europe, it behoves me, as a representative from Ireland, speaking at this round of the debate on the future of Lisbon, to point out a number of home truths.
Firstly, to congratulate all those who have been involved in bringing about the final agreement on the Lisbon Treaty.
But that is only the written document, and we ask ourselves - and often in this Parliament we ask ourselves - what does Europe want to see?
What do the people and citizens of Europe want to know about?
Yes, the citizens of Europe want more Europe.
But more Europe, to them, does not mean what a lot of us inside this room might think.
It does not mean new regulations, new laws - new restrictions, as they would see it.
It means a cleverer Europe, a Europe that delivers a response to their everyday needs.
That is why the Lisbon Strategy - the continuation and the improvement of the Lisbon Strategy - is so important as regards what would be happening within the Lisbon Council meeting.
Secondly, the whole issue of migration, which was touched on by many Members, is putting enormous pressure on resources, not just in financial terms as regards the cost to countries, especially those in the southern Mediterranean who are forced to expend huge amounts of money on tackling this problem, but on the social cohesion within those countries as well.
It is creating enormous problems and drawing on the goodwill and efforts that will be there.
Thirdly, and most importantly of all, the whole issue with regard to the kind of development of a European vision that we want to see around the world as is now being played out in Bali at the Climate Change Conference, as will be played out in the future at some other conferences in New York in the coming months, and, most importantly, that we have to tell our citizens and inform them properly of what comes before them.
Finally, could I say to President Barroso and to Vice-President Wallström, as we are having a referendum in Ireland: no tax, no tax, no tax.
The Treaties do not give you the power to come up with tax proposals.
The Commission should stay away from it.
<D>
(HU) Thank you, Mr President.
I speak now as one of the authors of written statement No 93.
The statement, which I tabled jointly with my fellow Members Mr Tabajdi, Mr Szent-Iványi, Mr Vigenin and Mr Amezaga, condemns the operations of paramilitary extremist groups within the Union, which are one of the most obvious forms of extremism.
In my experience, although many people feel a moral and political obligation to stop such extremist ideas from gaining ground, many stop short of specifically condemning it in a written statement or in another way.
There are many reasons for this.
One of them, for example, is that when we try to publicise these ideas, the list is never complete and never accurate.
This deters many people from supporting it.
However, one thing we must know is that the list will never be complete, and the concepts and definitions will never be accurate.
For this very reason, we must instead grab extremism and extremist ideas by the roots.
Today in this House is a day of celebration, but the Charter of Fundamental Rights has not come to be signed in untroubled circumstances.
This Charter summarises in 50 paragraphs all the values and rights that we respect and want to protect in the Union.
This Charter is the charter of anti-discrimination, the charter of the freedoms of expression, religion and assembly, the charter of equality and the charter of protection for individuals, data, young people and the elderly.
We cannot pick and choose from it at will, put some people before others or use it for our short-term internal policy objectives.
Everyone must be respected and protected equally, because this guarantees human dignity, and we, as members of the Parliament, have sworn to do that.
Opponents to the sum total of the ideas and rights formulated here are what we call extremists, irrespective of the age, sex, religion, or nationality of the person concerned.
In this spirit, I would like to ask my fellow Members to support written statement number 93.
Thank you.
<D>
According to recent media information, the French police are using the MINS database which focuses on Roma and travellers.
Non-governmental organisations have submitted complaints relating to the creation of illegal and secret databases for storing personal information in connection with racial and ethnic origins, and have stated that they are appealing to the relevant authorities.
The French authorities, however, deny the existence of such a database.
The Minister for Immigration has previously declared that biometric data on the deported Roma may be retained in the OSCAR database and in a new database that is under construction.
It is said that even the Netherlands and other countries of the European Union are registering data on ethnic and racial origin.
In connection with this, the Council is discussing a draft of the conclusions relating to mobile criminal groups in a very controversial way, and without informing the European Parliament of this initiative.
I would therefore like to ask you, Commissioner, what the Commission is doing, with regard to evidence on the existence of the MINS database in France, to verify such information.
If the Commission finds that the database breaches the principle of non-discrimination, what measures will it adopt to correct the situation?
Is the Commission considering bringing proceedings against Member States in connection with a breach of law, and with regard to recent developments in other Member States concerning the creation or existence of databases linked to racial or ethnic origin?
Will the Commission launch investigations in order to obtain information on such databases and to verify whether they are lawful in relation to the principle of non-discrimination?
I would finally also like to ask what the Commission is doing to ensure that Member States do not adopt ethnic profiling in their administrative and criminal law proceedings.
<D>
Madam President, may I thank the Minister for his reply.
I think we are far too defensive in this House - and in institutions generally - when it comes to Lisbon and the European Union in general.
It is time that we put some of the people who are attacking Europe on the defensive.
Where would we be without the European Central Bank?
Where would we be - those of us who are in the euro zone - without the euro zone?
The one thing we do not have is an identifiable head of the European Council who can speak on matters of economic recovery, and I think it is clear that the provision in the Lisbon Treaty to provide for such a person is really essential.
If we had that person in place now we would not have the zigzagging that goes on between the six-monthly presidencies.
Perhaps the Minister might say in his reply what he sees as the prospects for the ratification of the Treaty in the Czech Republic.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would firstly like to thank Doris Pack for her excellent report.
I welcome the opportunity to discuss Bosnia and Herzegovina with you today at a very crucial moment for the country and its European aspirations.
The signature of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) last June was a significant step forward for Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Together with the start of the visa dialogue, it gave a clear signal to the people of that country that their future lies in the European Union.
The EU was able to initial the SAA last December and sign it in June because the country's political leaders pulled together and reached consensus on the main conditions, particularly on police reform.
This proves that progress can be achieved and crises overcome when the political will exists, as Mr Jouyet rightly pointed out.
However, this consensus has since collapsed and reforms have been halted.
Nationalist rhetoric ahead of the local elections in October was one factor in this deterioration.
Yet the country's political problems run much deeper than that.
The lack of a common vision among the country's leaders about its future and the absence of consensus on EU reforms seriously harm its European prospects.
There is also open disagreement on most political questions, while there is no sense of urgency or responsibility to overcome this political stalemate.
I expressed my serious concern to the Presidency of the country during my visit to Sarajevo a few days ago.
I underlined that Bosnia and Herzegovina now needs to put EU-related reforms at the top of its political agenda and address the priorities of the European partnership, including state- and institution-building.
Your resolution sends a strong signal to the leaders of Bosnia and Herzegovina to get on with the reforms and to get their country back on the road to Europe.
Likewise, Bosnia and Herzegovina must be able to speak with one voice to advance in European integration.
Another litmus test of the country's ability to deliver on EU integration is the census.
From an EU perspective - as we all know - census data are vital for social and economic planning and development and for most Community policies.
The Commission will offer its assessment on the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the Progress Report on 5 November.
Like you, we shall also point out the fact that the leaders of Bosnia and Herzegovina can either continue to quarrel and fall behind their neighbours, or get on with reform and move forward towards the EU.
Your resolution underlines that closing down the Office of the High Representative (OHR) and strengthening the role of the European Union should remain our ultimate objective.
I agree.
The future of the OHR is a matter for the Peace Implementation Council to decide, but it is clearly in the interest of Bosnia and Herzegovina to reach a point where the OHR will no longer be needed, thus paving the way for a stronger EU presence and for realising the EU perspective of the country.
In other words, as we move into the next phase of our relations, Bosnia and Herzegovina itself must assume full ownership of the reform process that underpins its EU perspective.
The signature of the SAA this summer provided an opportunity that should not be wasted.
The challenge for Bosnia and Herzegovina's leaders is to achieve a degree of political consensus such as has delivered progress on EU integration elsewhere in the Western Balkans region.
They have done it before so they can do it again.
I hope our messages will now be heard.

Madam President, Mrs Vassiliou, ladies and gentlemen, the images of the 1999 storm, which was just mentioned and which hit south-west France causing tremendous damage, are still engraved on our collective memory.
It is an understatement to say that Europe was not prepared to endure such a tragedy again, so soon.
There are those who view it as a blow dealt by fate, but I see it rather as a horrendous example of the climate change which you have just referred to, Mrs Vassiliou, for which we merely propose rough solutions whereas in fact urgent action is needed.
This is a situation that we must handle responsibly.
Unfortunately, we need to be prepared to face even more natural disasters.
On 24 and 25 January this year, storm Klaus, which hit southern Europe, killed 11 people in France, 14 in Spain and three in Italy.
It caused significant damage, destroying schools and many homes, depriving thousands of people of electricity, heating, drinking water and a telephone service and leaving certain economic sectors in a critical situation, as in the case of the timber industry.
While I am keen to express my solidarity with the families of the victims and all those affected, and my support for local councillors, I would like to take advantage of this forum to call on the European Community since, it has to be said, this kind of situation requires a European response and, first and foremost, European solidarity.
Admittedly, in France a state of natural disaster has been declared, which will facilitate aid to disaster victims, but this does nothing to detract from the need to take coordinated European action to supplement the Member States' efforts to protect people, the environment and property in disaster-stricken towns and regions.
In practical terms, this primarily entails centralising information at European level in order to make a precise assessment of the damage.
We must then release the necessary funds to provide support for local authorities that are facing huge challenges.
In particular we should support the public services, which have been doing an exceptional job, and which we desperately need in order to repair infrastructure and equipment in the energy, water-supply, sewage, transport and telecommunications, health and education sectors.
Past disasters showed that action at European level is urgent and enabled the prevention of natural risks to be included as one the goals of the European Regional Development Fund.
From now on, Europe must prove its ability to react and to translate its solidarity into practical measures.
I therefore hope, although you have just said so, that the Commission will take this message on board and mobilise all means necessary to respond to this urgent situation, in particular through the EU Solidarity Fund and the Civil Protection Financial Instrument.
Lastly, in conclusion, I would like to remind you that, as with the fires in Greece in 2007, this violent storm has demonstrated the need for a civil protection force that can be mobilised in all crisis areas.
I would like to hear your opinion on this subject, Mrs Vassiliou, as well as your response to Parliament's request in its resolution of 27 April 2006, seeking the creation of a European observatory on natural disasters to ensure a more effective European response when these unfortunate events occur.
<D>
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Mr President, the reports put forward are very precise and well documented.
They give a convincing indication, I believe, of Parliament's current ability to evaluate EU policy on human rights and democracy.
Guidelines, dialogues and consultations, action plans, the human rights clause, election observation missions: these instruments are evaluated thoroughly and the progress that still needs to be made is also clearly identified, whether it is by devising human rights strategies for each country or precise indicators to evaluate situations, or asking Parliament to initiate appropriate measures for the implementation of the human rights clause.
These objectives are, I believe, well known both to the Commission and to the Council, and will remain on the agenda for our discussions.
Specific demands are also addressed to the Member States.
In particular, we deplore the fact that a large number of international conventions and additional protocols have still not been ratified by many of them: the Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families; the Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture; the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance; and other instruments, such as ILO Convention 169.
Ratifying them would honour the Member States and the EU as a whole.
There are also some even more difficult, and recurrent, issues that the international situation unfailingly places at the forefront of our concerns: issues concerning a comprehensive, integrated approach to human rights in all EU policies.
Yes, the asylum and immigration policy being pursued by the EU and the Member States leads to massive human rights violations, particularly at our external borders.
Yes, large European companies turn a blind eye to direct attacks on employment law or the right to a healthy environment, or are even the cause of them.
The EU should be moving towards a legislative framework that fosters compatibility in its activities and respect for human rights.
Yes, the food crisis calls our agricultural and energy policies into question.
Yes, once again, the impact of climate change on human rights is obvious.
The rights to life, health, housing and food are at the top of the list of violations.
Our ambition is a comprehensive, integrated policy.
Work on implementing the Treaty of Lisbon has begun.
It will mark an additional step in our commitment to human rights.
This commitment needs to be guaranteed by more substantial and coherent organisation and resources when it comes to human rights.
The European External Action Service should, for example, include a centre focusing on the cross-cutting nature of human rights.
The European Parliament itself should take the plunge.
A fully functional parliamentary body is highly desirable for this purpose.
<D>
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (ES) Mr President, Commissioner, since August I have taken part in various Parliamentary initiatives and have made various speeches in this plenary.
The basic issue - as we all know - is that the area around the Straits is one of the busiest areas in Europe for maritime traffic with more than 100 000 vessels per annum, 30 000 of which anchor in the area between the Bay of Algeciras and Gibraltar.
The underlying problem is that these two ports have no body to coordinate and monitor maritime traffic.
That is the basic problem.
We are launching a clear and precise initiative so that the two Member States involved in this matter can resolve this lack of coordination as soon as possible.
We are talking about two ports with the greatest volume of maritime traffic and it is unacceptable, in this day and age, that there is still no monitoring entity.
We are not just talking about the New Flame, we also had the Sierra Nava and the Samotraki, and these are incidents which obviously threaten maritime safety, the safety of persons and the natural environment.
Therefore, I think that Europe must take the initiative and give the Member States a clear directive.
It is unacceptable, in the 21st century, for the vessel still to be in its current condition.
Perhaps Spain was wrong to entrust salvage of the vessel to Gibraltar?
Perhaps the two administrations should have done it jointly?
I have a substantive matter to put to the Commissioner.
I put a question to the Commission - which Mr Dimas answered in March - highlighting an issue which is still not clear, namely what the vessel was carrying in its hold.
What type of scrap metal was it carrying?
The Commission replied saying that it was carrying 700 tonnes of IFO-380 fuel but we still do not know what type of scrap metal.
I think that this is unacceptable.
I call on the Commission to tell us once and for all what type of scrap metal the vessel was carrying.
<D>
rapporteur. - (FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is quite an important report just before the Bali Conference.
We are aware that international trade is developing at twice the speed of gross world product.
This means it is causing growth in the transport industry, one of the most prolific producers of greenhouse gases.
It is also enabling the relocation of production, which can be good in terms of using workforces and applying wage regulations, but, given that it takes no account whatsoever of the cost of greenhouse gases produced by this division of labour, it may accelerate the production of greenhouse gases and climate change.
To give you just one set of figures: ships, which carry 40 times more freight than planes, produce only twice as much greenhouse gas, but we still use planes to transport our goods to optimise the production cycle.
I therefore feel that, further to the Stern Report and the four reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, we should be aware that it is worth waiting half a day or even three more days for a product to arrive at its destination, rather than destroying our climate at a price the Stern Report estimates as 5 000 billion dollars.
Beyond this comment, the report makes an attempt to open up certain avenues.
Obviously there are certain avenues relating to transport.
We are pleased with the recent vote on the addition of the aviation industry to the European quota system.
The report encourages reflection on industrial organisation to reduce the geographic scale of production chains - producing in closer proximity to the end user - and makes a number of proposals in relation to trade in environmental commodities.
What we are proposing, within the context of the WTO and the bilateral or bi-regional agreements - in other words, all the agreements we are currently negotiating - is to prioritise the assessment of the effects on climate change within the assessment made by these agreements of the environmental effects.
We also suggest prioritising a considerable reduction in all tariff and non-tariff barriers - and here we are thinking about royalties in particular - that hinder trade in own goods and services which are the ones that can reduce the production of greenhouse gases.
All this must evidently be carried out within the most multilateral context, with the WTO if possible, in the absence of any bi-regional agreements currently being negotiated by Europe.
We cannot, however, rule out the possibility that, after 2012, in the initial post-Kyoto phase, mankind will not have reached a unanimous agreement on the fight against climate change.
In this case, Europe's decision to lead the fight against climate change will definitely hit some of its sectors.
It will not hit all of them.
In many cases, being the leader of the fight against climate change provides a competitive edge.
In some cases, and here I am thinking specifically of the cement industry, this could pose enormous problems and could even lead to cement tourism.
In that case, when all the possibilities of multilateral agreements have been exhausted, we suggest adopting the GATT's Article 20, in other words, border adjustment taxes to restore fair competition.
This, ladies and gentlemen, forms the basis of my proposals.
<D>
Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, thank you for this debate and this discussion.
I think it is difficult to summarise but, if I were to do so, I would repeat what some of you have said about this being a fundamental element in any democracy.
I prefer to look at it from the point of view of citizens: the right of citizens to know what is going on and to have access to information and documents and to then be able to make an informed choice.
We will all have a very crucial year, because on the 7 June the citizens of Europe will vote in elections.
It is, of course, absolutely fundamental that they have access to information.
We are still carrying a burden of historical differences in culture and views on what should be made public or not.
I think we are still struggling with that in some cases.
I come from a country where we have a very long tradition of the principle of openness and access to documents, while in other Member States it has been the opposite: It is first secret and only the things you decide should not be secret should be made public.
I think this is still something that we have to try to tackle and deal with.
I think that the report has also shown all the linkages and the interlinkages between all these issues and we have to look at it from a political point of view.
Again, the beauty of the Lisbon Treaty is that it would actually extend the right of information and access to documents and hopefully help end the 'blame game', as it would also give us a chance to follow what goes on in the European Council.
Mr Cashman and others mentioned this and I think it is so important for all of us.
I hope you know that you can count on me to continue, on a daily basis, to strive to make sure that the Commission improves its access to documents.
We can look at what we do in the committees; we can improve what we do on registers and on a number of points that Mr Cappato has raised and that are helpful to us.
I think you should keep up the pressure on the Commission, but you have also shown that it concerns Parliament as well.
You can also improve and add to openness and transparency.
This is certainly a part of strengthening democracy in Europe.
We will have the chance to do some work on this during preparations for the EP elections.
That would be one of the ultimate tests for all of us.
Thank you very much for the discussion and we will come back to it very soon when we discuss Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001.
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (LT) Madam President, Commissioner, Secretary of State, ladies and gentlemen, today here in the European Parliament we are returning to the issue of a moratorium on capital punishment.
We have already considered this issue twice over the last year, with two resolutions on the implementation of a global moratorium on capital punishment being adopted (on 1 February and 26 April).
We can only regret that in the case of each of these resolutions the European Parliament addressed the Council, encouraging it to submit the resolution to the General Assembly of the United Nations, but the Council has not yet done so.
The Council could do this before the start of the session of the 62nd General Assembly and it would be possible to adopt the resolutions before the end of this year.
Capital punishment is a cruel and inhuman kind of punishment infringing one of the inherent human rights - the right to life - and we really cannot tolerate a situation where thousands of people face capital punishment every year in Iran and China and other countries.
Therefore, the implementation of a global moratorium on capital punishment seeking to fully abolish it remains one of our most important political aims and we therefore require not only the consensus of our parliamentary groups on this issue, but also the consensus of all EU Member States.
I am sure that in adopting this resolution the European Parliament could show extraordinary solidarity and consensus, despite a difference of opinion, for example regarding the declaration of 10 February as the European Day against the Death Penalty.
The European Parliament has a golden opportunity to demonstrate cohesion and solidarity to the Council, especially when taking a decision on a political issue that has clear added value.
Politics without value is just cheap politicking and populism, while human life is valuable to us all, irrespective of geographical or cultural divides.
I truly encourage my fellow members in all groups to support this important resolution.
(Applause)
<D>
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, as shadow rapporteur for the Liberal Group, I would like to thank Malcolm Harbour and my other colleagues for their excellent cooperation.
This dossier is of great importance for all electronic communications users in the European Union, and the compromise we agreed in the end with the Council - and they were not at all easy discussions - was a balanced one.
There have been some important achievements as a result of the negotiations with the Council.
One of the great improvements in comparison to the first reading relates to access to the 112 European emergency number, and the obligation of operators to make caller location available without any derogation on the grounds of technical feasibility, at least for fixed and mobile telephone operators.
This is a major achievement since it will help the emergency services respond more efficiently, and will enhance the protection of all citizens' lives wherever they are in the European Union.
The provisions on traffic management policies were a controversial point in the report, but I strongly believe that the compromise protects users' rights to access content and use services of their own choice.
No one in this House ever wanted to restrict freedom on the Internet.
Our objective has been to allow traffic management procedures, as long as they are necessary, to ensure the best possible online experience for end-users, and as long as they do not restrict competition between service providers.
I consider the compromise to be totally in line with this objective, which is why I fully support it.
I also believe that all measures regarding access to, and use of, services should respect the fundamental rights and freedoms of all citizens, and this has also been safeguarded in the report.
Some among us may not be happy with this compromise, but I would like to stress that, despite its shortcomings, this is the best we could achieve with the Council, and I strongly advise you to vote for it tomorrow.
<D>
I voted for the report because I am convinced that an integrated industrial policy for Europe is indispensable, especially in the face of the new challenges brought about by globalisation, and a further development of industrial policy is therefore necessary.
Industrial policy serves as a driver for sustainable employment and the prosperity of society.
A single job in industry creates at least two more jobs.
Europe's position in industrial policy is increasingly being put in doubt as a result of increasing industrialisation in the emerging countries and the growing strength of our largest competitors, like the US and China.
We must therefore develop more ourselves; for that to be the case, we need to make sure to renew our industrial base by taking steps in specific sectors, but also by guaranteeing, in broad terms, the competitiveness of Europe on a global level and the sustainable growth of European industry.
The report also calls for an integrated industrial policy to serve as the foundation for environmental, competition and trade policy, in order to improve resource efficiency.
In addition, the report highlights the importance of a constructive partnership with workers and trade union organisations.
The need to improve coordination between the EU and the Member States is also emphasised in the report.
I consider these measures to be absolutely necessary.
This report makes provision for the further development of industrial policy to be approached with the necessary ambition and prudence.
<D>
Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, I am very pleased to be here today to speak on behalf of the Commission on this key issue of transparency.
I must thank Mr Pomés Ruiz for this own-initiative report and the Committee on Budgetary Control for its valuable contribution.
The report addresses five main issues.
First, the report gives guidance on the publication of information about those receiving EU funds through grants and contracts.
We are working to implement the terms of the modified Financial Regulation on transparency.
These terms were included through Parliament's efforts and came into force in May 2007.
With regard to direct management, the Commission launched a website last year, with a single portal giving access to all relevant sites in the various directorates-general.
Although we continue to update these sites, the portal still seems a rather confusing and complicated entry point.
The Commission services are working to improve this.
Regarding shared management, the role of the Commission is to 'finalise and agree with Member States on the common standards of these sets of information before April 2008'.
I am quoting here from the draft discharge report by Mr Jørgensen.
The Member States will remain responsible for the data.
The Commission assumes responsibility for the standards applicable and checking that Member States respect the terms of the Financial Regulation.
The second issue in Mr Pomés Ruiz's report is the issue of recoveries.
I clearly said in the Committee on Budgetary Control in January 2008 that 'the Commission has so far been unable to give Parliament a comprehensive picture of all our recovery efforts'.
I gave an estimate for the recoveries made in 2006 and announced improvements to our own systems, so that, this year, the ABAC accounting system will include more detailed and complete data on recoveries.
We are discussing the methodology for doing so with the European Court of Auditors.
Information about recoveries would be incomplete without reliable input from the Member States.
For agriculture, the picture is encouraging.
Tomorrow, the Commission will adopt an action plan to strengthen our supervisory role regarding the Structural Funds, addressing this issue among other things.
The third issue in the report relates to the declaration of financial interests and, in particular, to the results of an independent comparative study launched in July 2006, in the context of the European Transparency Initiative, and published in 2007.
The study concluded that most of the European institutions are regulated more intensively than institutions at national level.
The Commission and the European Investment Bank have the most comprehensive ethical rules of the EU institutions.
While the study noted that the Commission has a relatively well developed system for notification of conflicts of interests, it suggests that consideration be given to enlarging the mandate of our ad hoc Ethical Committee to include a broader advisory role.
I invite you to examine the study and draw whatever conclusions you think are relevant for the European Parliament.
The fourth issue raised by Mr Pomés Ruiz concerns the composition of experts groups advising the Commission.
I would like to thank Mr Pomés Ruiz for recognising the value of the work done so far.
We will study the recommendations you make for further improvements.
The fifth and final main issue concerns governance within the institutions.
Last Friday, 15 February 2008, was the deadline for Member States to send in 'annual summaries'.
As of noon today, we had received 22 replies from the Member States.
We are assessing the compliance of these reports with the obligations under the Financial Regulation, and we will report to you as soon as we have a clear picture of this, including with regard to the quality of these reports.
In conclusion, I can declare that we are taking transparency very seriously and that the European Transparency Initiative is delivering on many points raised in the report.
(Applause)
<D>
I voted in favour of the four directives on the energy and climate change package because it was important for the EU to adopt these texts before 2009 and the international negotiations.
To postpone it would have delayed taking action and accrued delays, without guaranteeing an improved text.
I voted YES:
because the 3x20 targets have been confirmed (20% reduction of greenhouses gases, 20% reduction of energy consumed, 20% renewable energy) and an increase to a 30% reduction of greenhouse gases in the event of a more ambitious international agreement;
because it is vital since the texts proposed by the Council do not go as far as the Commission's proposals and there is a risk of not achieving the stated targets - staggering over time, a large number of derogations, the possibility of financing gas reductions from outside the EU, which delays the essential decarbonisation of our industries, economies and means of development;
as a precaution, because if the targets are not met on the way, Parliament will have to impose new policies;
because it is a first step.
I have always believed that emissions trading schemes would not transform our industry or our activities, in order to reduce their environmental impact.
We must contemplate significant appropriations for research and innovation, establishing standards and customs tariffs in order to tackle environmental dumping, as well as industrial policies and European funds to accompany the changes.
<D>
in writing. - A significant part of the European population lives in the coastal regions.
Most do not realise that the European mainland coast stretches for almost 90000 km.
The development of sustainable tourism as opposed to seasonal tourism has to be encouraged.
It is only through product diversification and alternative forms of tourism such as business, conference, cultural, medical, sport, agricultural, language and sea related tourism that this can be achieved.
Promoting traditional coastal tourism however remains a priority.
In my country we are endeavouring to increase the size and quantity of sand beaches.
Unfortunately to date this has been approached in an amateurish fashion.
Dumping sand on existing beaches or creating new sandy beaches without undertaking the necessary infrastructural works is just a waste of resources.
Extending or creating sandy beaches has been taking place in many other countries and territories for years.
The difference is that it was approached firstly by putting into place the necessary infrastructural works to accumulate sand naturally and prevent its erosion.
And in this context one additional and important aspect which appears to be lacking in relation to current proposals to Malta's largest sandy beach l-Ghadira - is respect and sensitivity to the immediate environment.
<D>
The EU has committed to achieving the Millennium Development Goals, such as reducing the maternal mortality rate by 75% by 2015.
Although, on the whole, the EU countries are on the right path, slow progress is recorded in the field of maternal health.
The European Commission's initiatives to allocate funds for the health systems reform in order to improve the quality of prenatal and postnatal services, as well as of the access to such services, the support of research in the field of reproductive medicine and the training of medical personnel were opportune for achieving goal No. 5.
The Charter on enhancing the performance of health systems, adopted in Tallinn, in June 2008, is also important progress.
Nevertheless, there are developed countries, such as France, Great Britain or the Netherlands, with a very low mortality rate, for which the 75% reduction by 2015 seems difficult, since evolution is slower than in the countries with a higher maternal mortality rate.
Also, there are still disparities as regards the progress made in the EU states and even in the regions of various countries.
Therefore, in order to manage to achieve the goal set for 2015, the rapid modernisation of the European health systems is necessary, with a special emphasis on research for improving prenatal and postnatal services, as well as more efficient sanitary education and family planning.
<D>
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have followed the Union for the Mediterranean initiative, on which next Sunday's summit in Paris will focus and we hope that the initiative is successful.
I would like to clarify a few things, however.
This initiative aims to reinforce the multilateral Euro-Mediterranean dimension.
I believe this is right and that we should go in this direction.
I think that if there is a policy that needs a critical appraisal, however, it is the neighbourhood with the southern countries, because the neighbourhood policy actually brings countries into competition with one another that are very divided.
So we need to work on integration between these countries and between them and Europe, and channel resources into that as well.
I will tell you this openly, President-in-Office of the Council, that we really did not appreciate - and I am saying this to President Barroso as well - your stopping funding for the Audiovisuel Méditerranée programme, which was the only cultural co-production instrument.
You have said that there is a European cultural exception but I would add, Mr President, that there is a Euro-Mediterranean cultural exception.
If you consider the world's top twenty intellectuals, in the top ten you will find many from the Muslim culture and a great many Euro-Mediterranean ones.
So let us help one another to put in place effective policies to change the lives of many people in these countries, especially young people and women, who place hope in Europe.
We do not need good students: we need to change the reality of this relationship and Parliament is very ready to cooperate with your Presidency if you intend to move in that direction.
<D>
(EL) Mr President, as all the previous speakers have said, the symbols of the European Union have existed for many years.
What are we in the European Parliament aiming for by amending the Rules?
We wish to emphasise what is called the proper use of symbols, as is done in all organisations.
Unfortunately, there have been unjustified reactions from both Member States and citizens.
These are reactions from Member States that think that adopting and promoting the symbols of the EU will lead to the creation of a super-state.
For heaven's sake, will symbols really create the super-state that some Members have talked about?
Some say that the national morale of peoples and states will be affected.
If the national morale of anyone is so low that it can be eclipsed by a symbol of unity of all states, then I pity what some call 'national pride'.
Such arguments have been heard in this House.
There is another question.
If some citizens and Member States react so badly to these symbols, how can they continue to be members of this EU when they cannot even bear to look at its symbols?
This is a contradiction.
The European Parliament is right to proceed as usual today with the formal adoption of these symbols.
It is sending out a message: the EU must advance united under its symbols in order to become complete and reach a point where it can play its part.
Its role is to promote principles and values throughout the world.
<D>
Once again, we are calling attention to the question of free speech and freedom of the press and to the general policy of treating journalists in Azerbaijan.
Reports from a variety of sources indicate that the situation of journalists and every kind of political activist in Azerbaijan is becoming increasingly difficult.
As far back as 2005, the President of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev, pledged that all the rights of journalists would be respected and that they would be able to count on help in the event of any kind of danger.
The facts reveal, however, that those words are just an empty promise.
As someone who, for many years, worked as a journalist and has a thorough knowledge of the job, this matter is of particular importance to me.
In Azerbaijan, journalists are constantly hindered from fulfilling their basic role - the reliable and credible provision of information.
It is unacceptable that journalists are carrying out their work under the threat of arrests and body searches.
The Azerbaijani authorities have to realise that the activity of free and independent media is a clear signal to the international community that a country is a credible partner on the world stage.
The message given by the European Parliament should be clear - the benefits of economic cooperation with the European Union must not obscure expectations regarding the need to move towards European standards of respect for fundamental human rights, in particular, free speech and freedom of the press, which are a pillar of democracy and without which it is impossible for a modern democratic society to exist.
<D>
The debate on trade relations with China always brings us back to the issue of human rights in that country.
It is understandable.
The objections raised by the relationship with China can be understood in the light of various assessments, which are, in most cases, justifiable.
The perception that Chinese economic growth has no parallel in the respect of human rights and democracy in that country, nor in its actions at international level, the exploitation of workers, a regulatory framework on labour that is incomparably less demanding, disregard for environmental matters and for rules on intellectual property and patents, all these factors are barriers to open trade relations that are marked by respect for international good practice.
Nevertheless, this trade is there, and it is growing.
China's role in the modern world economy is unequalled and its participation in overcoming the present crisis is vital.
It is therefore necessary to insist on respect for the rules and principles of international trade, for equal access to markets and for the defence of democracy and human rights, without rejecting the reality and our growing interdependency.
In fact, we need to make the most of this situation, if only to better influence this great country.
<D>
Madam President, artificial, man-made famines were used systematically as a tool by Communist totalitarian regimes.
Seventy-five years ago, Stalin decided to uproot the Ukrainian national identity and resistance by creating such a famine in the very bread-basket of Europe.
Regions struck by famine were not merely denied assistance.
Even worse, hundreds of villages were cordoned off by the Red Army.
Starving people were denied the most elementary human right - the right to escape from certain death.
People who tried to flee were hunted down like wild animals and shot.
Only today are we reacting to one of the most appalling crimes by the Communist dictatorship.
An authoritative assessment of such crimes is long overdue.
All victims of the crimes against humanity deserve the same status.
There cannot be first-class Nazi victims or second-class victims of Communism just because Europe still lacks an integrated approach to all totalitarian regimes and has hesitated to take a concrete stand on crimes that took place in the eastern part of the continent.
We have a duty to know what happened under Stalin just as well as we know what happened under Hitler.
We need to extend not only our solidarity to the Ukrainian nation and, indeed, to all nations that have suffered under totalitarian crimes, but also to pass a moral verdict.
Only in this way can we reach the goal of these debates: to guarantee that this monumental, destructive disregard for human lives and dignity will never be repeated in any part of Europe.
We need an all-European reconciliation, a reconciliation that can result only from truth and justice.
Our duty is to make sure that the famous 'never again' will equally apply to the Ukrainian nation.
<D>
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DA) Mr President, the visit to the West Bank and Gaza a couple of weeks ago that has been mentioned was a shock - even for those of us who have been there many times.
Israel's closure of the borders and the countless roadblocks make it impossible to develop a healthy economy, and for the EU's rules on humanitarian assistance to be followed.
The Council and the Commission should intervene immediately to help the Palestinian economy back on its feet.
Let me make myself clear: without such intervention a peace conference cannot succeed.
As has been said repeatedly, the economic dimension is inseparable from the political.
In other words, Israel's occupation must be brought to an end or there will never be peace.
Besides the economic exhaustion, radicalisation of Palestinians is currently taking place.
It is growing among the poor - of whom there are more and more as a result of Israel's blockade - and among the young.
Older generations of Palestinians have warned repeatedly that the young people growing up today have never lived side by side with Israelis, and that their only experience of them is ugly walls, military invasions and teenage soldiers humiliating their fathers.
This is not the way to create peace, only implacable enemies.
Nor is there any confidence in the EU, which disregarded the democratic elections in the Palestinian territories and, by isolating Hamas, has demonstrated both diplomatic incompetence and, once again, double standards.
Unless all Palestinians are represented in the ongoing negotiations there will be no peace, as anyone involved with the issue is well aware.
As Mr Davies and others have mentioned, all hope of peace will shatter if, as has been reported, the Government of Israel means to expropriate E1.
Both the USA and the EU have said in no uncertain terms that this must not happen.
The question that Council and Commission should answer now is what action is planned to prevent this expropriation of Palestinian East Jerusalem.
<D>
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (LT) Good fences make good neighbours.
That is an old English saying.
Today, thinking about neighbouring countries, it would be more appropriate to say that low fences or no fences are better.
At the juncture of the 20th and 21st centuries, with increasing tendencies towards authoritarianism, Belarus became the odd sick man of Europe.
The country slid into self-isolation and isolation, as the fences surrounding it grew ever higher.
Due to human rights abuses there was no place in the European Council for a state at the centre of Europe.
Last year gave us hope that relations between the European Union and Belarus can change and that the fences I mentioned can be lowered.
Here mention has been made of the small steps which Minsk has taken in the right direction in terms of political prisoners, the registration of parties and the registration of newspapers.
We might also mention the future opening of a European Union representation.
I share the cautious optimism of both the Commission Member and the Minister and feel that the skies are clearing, but that there are still many clouds.
Here our colleague Mr Protasiewicz has already mentioned both media freedom and real conditions allowing the formation of political parties, and the country is generally also on the brink of great economic and social changes.
Reforms should look to the future and make the lives of ordinary people easier.
I think that the European Union should also go down the road of mutual understanding.
Firstly by destroying or at least lowering the financial fences of visa requirements, which prevent people from communicating so much.
Belarus has taken the decision to build a new nuclear power plant which will probably appear quite close to Lithuania's capital Vilnius.
Several such power plants are planned for the region in Lithuania, Estonia and Poland.
There needs to be dialogue among all these and other states and constant consultations, so that we avoid misunderstandings, damage to the environment and disregard for the interests of other countries.
Brussels should watch carefully how Minsk implements the IAEA's recommendations, conventions on nuclear security, and defend the interests of European Union countries.
I do not think that Belarus will make any real progress unless the wall between official institutions and people there is torn down.
The government should be interested in talking to and negotiating with the opposition, NGOs, unions and youth organisations.
In a few months the European Parliament will submit recommendations as to whether we should continue tearing down that fence, or build an even higher one.
If we fail to take advantage of this chance, people on both sides will be disillusioned.
The ball, as they say, is in Minsk's court.
<D>
(FR) Mr President, I, in turn, would like to express my satisfaction with the agreement reached in conciliation.
It required the intelligence of the Swedish Presidency, the effective contribution of the Commission, the competence of our rapporteurs and the sense of compromise of the political groups' representatives.
May we thank them all.
In my view, however, the big news of the day is not this agreement.
When it comes to the future of the European budget, the week's major event is not taking place here in Strasbourg, but in Copenhagen.
There, our great national leaders have taken two days to agree to find EUR 2 400 000 000 to finance so-called EU aid for disadvantaged countries affected by climate change, and this is just for 2010.
We MEPs would have been considered irresponsible had we failed to make EUR 81 million in EU budget cuts, and here we see EUR 2 400 000 000 being plucked out of thin air.
I welcome this outcome, but no democrat can accept a procedure that is so obscure, so devoid of all democratic control - all the parliaments, the European Parliament and the national parliaments, are going to be presented with a fait accompli - and which has such unfair consequences for certain Member States, since some will pay two or three times as much as other, equally wealthy, States.
Nevertheless, let us welcome this first: our Heads of State or Government are recognising that common EU policies can no longer make do with a budget that is limited to 1% of gross domestic product.
They are reinventing the European budget, but in a kind of parallel form.
I am counting on the new European Commission and on the Spanish Presidency to help us lay the foundations of the new budgetary Europe, which no one now disputes is necessary.
<D>
First and foremost, we congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Patrão Neves, on the excellent work she has done up to now and on the positive outcome of the vote.
We hope that the Green Paper, which will arrive shortly in committee, is the prelude to the swift arrival in plenary of the White Paper.
Europe has always taken an interest in the fisheries sector.
We believe, however, that it is essential to provide for greater investment in scientific research, especially in the fisheries sector, including within the next framework programme.
We also believe it is essential to improve knowledge in the sector of the rules through greater flexibility of the quota system and increased responsibility in relation to control and stocks.
We also want stronger partnerships with third countries in order to combat illegal fishing, and a greater degree of cooperation with the countries of the Mediterranean, so that we may regulate more decisively fishing in a sea such as the Mediterranean, which has always been the cradle of different civilisations and cultures.
Lastly, we agree with the provisions of paragraph 23 on modernisation, especially of the small-scale fleet, although we would like more details on this matter.
With regard to paragraphs 62 and 63 on professional qualifications for operators in the sector, we would like further clarification, especially as regards small-scale fishing, which would end up being penalised the most if the rules on fleet management were made tougher.
<D>
Mr President, nearly three weeks have passed since cyclone Nagris hit Burma destroying the harbours and the deltas of the Ayeyarwady.
It destroyed houses and towns killing thousands of people and leaving thousands of others homeless.
History has taught us that, unless we react immediately when people suffer, their suffering is bound to increase by multiples and factors way beyond our conception.
In many ways, the failure of the Burmese regime is a reflection of what we have been saying in this Parliament over the last number of years concerning the military junta that is presently in place in Burma.
However, despite our objections to that military junta, we must find mechanisms - however they are arrived at - to deliver aid directly to the people.
I welcome the fact - and little did I think I would be saying this today - that the military junta has now allowed in five United Nations helicopters to distribute food, despite the fact that a French naval vessel and American naval vessels are in the bay waiting to deliver food and medical aid to the people.
It is incumbent on all of us to guarantee that we can make the best possible efforts to assist human beings when they are suffering.
Indeed, with regard to those great defenders of Burma, the Chinese, Burma could learn from the way in which the Chinese reacted to their most recent natural disaster by appealing for international aid and assistance from Japan and other countries.
Hopefully among these different alliances we can create conditions whereby the aid and succour can be delivered.
The issue with regard to the International Criminal Court is a matter for another day.
Our first and most immediate aim and task, following what Louis Michel has already said, is to guarantee that we put in place the mechanisms to deliver that aid, to rebuild the infrastructure, to rebuild homes and, most importantly of all, to prevent the continuing suffering of the Burmese people.
<D>
(NL) Mr President, the Constitution is dead.
Long live the Constitution!
How else to describe the events in Lisbon?
We all agree that this Reform Treaty is a mere clone of the Constitution rejected by the French and Dutch; one that, as Valéry Giscard d'Estaing said, is even less readable than the original.
After all, referendums are to be avoided at all costs, we are told.
There is indeed one major difference from 2005.
This time the French, Dutch and other European peoples are not being given the chance to express their opinions.
An illustration of this disdain for democracy can be found in the statements of Commissioner Wallström, who always has so much to say about bridging the gap between Europe and the citizen.
She is urging the national parliaments to ratify this text as quickly as possible.
Yet genuine respect for democracy requires that the citizens of all EU Member States be able to express their opinions on the Treaty, a text which, in numerous respects, erodes the sovereignty of the nation-states even more than is already the case.
Those responsible should not complain if this fear of citizens again goes against official Europe in the subsequent European elections.
<D>
(RO) Admitting the progress achieved lately by Iraq internally and at foreign affairs level, the European Union must encourage the Iraqi authorities in continuing their efforts to develop democratic, stable, lawful state institutions, of a federal type.
Taking account of the ethnic and religious realities, I believe that only a federal Iraq can be viable.
I am referring to a federal Iraq and not to a divided one.
The European Union must also encourage the existence of a stable Iraq, with institutions capable of providing national sovereignty, state unity, territorial integrity, sustainable economic development and prosperity for the Iraqi people.
The European Union must actively support the institutional development of Iraq, strongly rooted in its realities, with due respect of the historical, religious, cultural and identity traditions of the Iraqi people and of all the ethnic and religious communities within its territory.
In this context, it is advisable to establish certain consultative bodies, made up of the leaders of all the ethnic and religious communities of Iraq, with a view to conferring more legitimacy on the central authorities.
Iraqi institutional development must be supported by the European Union by means of the Eujust Lex mission, as well as by adequate European financial tools.
I stress the necessity that European funding be addressed directly to the beneficiary Iraqi institutions.
Such funds should be managed by the European Union institutions in a transparent and visible way for European citizens.
I recommend that the European Union institutions use the experience and expertise of those Member States that already have a civil and military presence on Iraqi territory in the process of stabilisation and reconstruction of this country.
At the same time, I believe that European companies should be encouraged and supported in getting involved in the process of the reconstruction of Iraqi and in better developing their business in this area.
<D>
I voted in favour of this resolution on Turkey's 2010 progress report.
When it began negotiations on EU accession, Turkey committed itself to reforms, good neighbourly relations and progressive alignment with the EU.
However, it is clear that Turkey's progress is too slow, demonstrating the unwillingness of this country's government representatives to implement reforms and democratise the country.
The European Parliament has serious concerns about the deterioration in freedom of the press, about certain acts of censorship and about growing self-censorship within the Turkish media, including on the Internet.
We condemn the restrictions on freedom of assembly and, in particular, the violent police crackdown on student demonstrations at Ankara University in December 2010.
The European Parliament is also concerned that human rights defenders are being persecuted in Turkey.
This represents just a portion of the human rights violations in a country that aims to become an EU Member State.
It is clear that the current human rights situation in Turkey is complicated, one might even say contrary to the EU's values and policies.
Against such a backdrop, negotiations on EU accession are leading to a dead end.
I therefore believe that the Turkish authorities must adopt immediate rigorous reforms in all branches of government or consider the possibility of becoming not an EU Member, but a strategic partner.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - (CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, water scarcity and drought represent a major global problem and it is clear that climate change will aggravate the situation and result in serious water scarcity.
This trend was confirmed by another report on the impact of climate change in Europe, prepared by the European Environment Agency last week.
The frequency and intensity of droughts in the European Union have dramatically increased over the past 30 years, and over 100 million people and almost one third of the EU were affected in 2003.
Since the Commission presented its communication on water scarcity and droughts, we have seen further evidence of this trend.
Cyprus is experiencing its worst drought since 1900.
Water supplies for irrigation purposes were suspended during the summer and farmers suffered 80% crop losses as a result.
In some areas cereal crops were completely destroyed.
The estimated losses exceed 1.5% of Cyprus's GDP.
Nor was this an isolated occurrence: 2008 is the third consecutive drought year in Cyprus.
This is therefore the right time for Parliament to debate its report on water scarcity and droughts.
I am glad that the European Parliament has taken this opportunity to send out a clear message that it is important to tackle this problem.
Global warming, population growth and increasing per capita consumption all mean that the pressure on our water resources is rising.
As a consequence, water scarcity or droughts are becoming increasingly likely, and they have a direct effect on the population and on those economic sectors that depend on water supply, for example agriculture, tourism, industry, power supply and transport.
They also have negative side effects for biodiversity and water quality.
The risks of forest fires and the consumption of land are increasing.
Unless urgent measures are taken, entire regions will face the risk of desertification, both within and outside the European Union.
In order to prevent this, our top priority must be a shift towards practices that will lead to effective water use and water savings.
At the same time, measures aimed at water saving will be adopted at all levels.
In order to achieve this, the entire population will have to play a role; the adoption of government measures will not on its own be enough.
The latest Eurobarometer poll, asking the public about their attitude towards climate change, indicates that 62% of Europeans consider climate change/global warming to be among the two most serious problems facing the world today, while 68% of Europeans feel that 'poverty, the lack of food and drinking water' is the most serious problem.
In this context the good news is that the fears expressed by the members of the public are also reflected in their behaviour: 61% of Europeans declare that they have personally taken actions aimed at tackling climate change and more than half have reduced their consumption of water at home.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to note that your report welcomes the Commission communication and supports the proposed first set of policy options for action.
I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Seeber, for his excellent work on this report, as well as Mrs Herranz García and Mrs García Pérez from the Committee on Agriculture and the Committee on Regional Development for their positive and constructive contributions.
There is broad agreement between the report and the conclusions adopted by the Council last year regarding the measures to be taken.
The task now is to turn this political support into real actions.
<D>
- (FR) Madam President, in answer to Mr Rack's question, we are, of course, well aware of the strong Turkish influence on the northern part of Cyprus, and we shall raise these problems.
As you know, a delegation of elected representatives from Northern Cyprus will be visiting the European Parliament on Thursday, and that will be an opportunity to express our deep concern about these matters.
Let me reassure Mr Allister by telling him that we naturally monitor the fate of all confessions, and I thank him for reporting the case of these two young men from the Protestant community who have indeed been subjected to threats or aggression because of their religious beliefs.
We shall therefore bring this point to the attention of the Turkish authorities, Mr Allister.
Subject: New migratory pressures on Europe
In recent weeks an increase has been felt in the migratory pressure on the Mediterranean countries of the European Union.
Is the Council considering new diplomatic measures or other types of action to help those countries hold back the fresh wave of illegal immigration currently affecting that area?
<D>
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Madam President, let me say categorically that we must not permit the United States to split Europe.
The European Union must act as one, because that is the only way for it to make its distinctive mark and to carry weight on the international stage.
This applies especially to its dealings with the United States.
A single Member State naturally possesses less clout than the European Union as a community.
Nevertheless, by going it alone, a Member State can weaken the Union as a whole and indeed seriously weaken it.
Such an approach gnaws at the very core of Europe's credibility.
It virtually gives the United States a hammer, served on a silver platter, with which to drive a wedge through Europe, enabling Washington to obtain from individual states what it cannot obtain from the Union as a whole.
The negotiations between the United States and the EU that culminated in the agreement of July 2007 on the transfer of passenger name records showed that it was scarcely possible for the Union to secure US acceptance of any of its positions.
In the view of many Europeans, and in my opinion too, that agreement already lets the United States access too much information on European air passengers.
Moreover, we do not even know exactly how these data are being used or to whom they are being passed on.
The fundamental question is whether these stacks of data serve any purpose at all in the fight against terrorism.
I therefore find it downright grotesque that individual Member States are now going even further than the agreement requires and are letting themselves be drawn into a kind of horse-trading in which visa waivers are being bartered for the transfer of even more data.
That cannot be in the interests of the general public.
Citizens of these Member States would certainly be given the right to enter the United States without a visa, as other EU citizens already can, but at what cost for all of us?
No, such an approach exposes Europe to the risk of blackmail.
If the Member States do not act together and show solidarity, and if they do not nurture the cohesion of the Union, we should not be surprised if people in the United States do not take the European Union seriously.
<D>
Europeana, the European Digital Library, faces many challenges today.
The success of this pan-European undertaking is far from being assured.
Firstly, because until now, Europeana has contained, principally, works coming from just a few of the most active countries.
Secondly, these are not contemporary works, which would attract the greatest interest, but older ones which are in the public domain.
I would like to draw particular attention to one aspect of the Europeana project which, in my opinion, is of crucial significance for its success - financing.
The process of extending digital collections is very expensive and will take many more years.
Meanwhile, Europeana is only guaranteed financial resources up until 2013, as part of a project financed partly by the European Commission and Member States, and also by private sponsors.
I think it is essential to ensure stable sources of finance as part of the new Financial Perspective for 2014-2020.
European funds in the form of grants made to individual cultural institutions in Member States should encourage them to be more effective in the digitisation of collections.
At the same time, compulsory digitisation targets should be introduced, which Member States would have to meet in a specified time.
Only consistent realisation of a 'carrot and stick' approach will ensure that Europeana becomes an attractive portal of great interest to readers and researchers, and not a digital attic used for the sentimental storage of old junk.
<D>
(EL) Mr President, the next few days will mark:
10 years since the dirty war unleashed by ΝΑΤΟ and the governments of the European Union, both centre left and centre right, against the people of Yugoslavia;
6 years since the criminal war and occupation of Iraq by the USA and its willing allies, a war which has cost the lives of approximately 1.5 million Iraqis;
60 years since the establishment of ΝΑΤΟ, the imperialist war machine and threat to peace throughout the world which is preparing to mark its 60th anniversary with a celebratory summit in Strasbourg.
In Washington ten years ago, on 23 and 24 April 1999, the leaders of the ΝΑΤΟ member states signed a 50th anniversary declaration approving its new doctrine.
Thus the new NATO strategy was adopted, which also officially overthrows the basic rules of international law.
A series of other criminal interventions by NATO followed in Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran and the Middle East.
In the run-up to the NATO summit, the French authorities have turned the centre of Strasbourg into an off-limits zone and activated the facility provided for in the Schengen Convention in order to prevent peace demonstrators from entering France.
They have mobilised considerable army and police forces to deal with demonstrators.
These measures, which blatantly violate basic democratic rights, illustrate how much the imperialists and ΝΑΤΟ fear the people.
The people need to respond to the celebrations and 'fiestas' marking the 60th anniversary of criminal imperialist action by ΝΑΤΟ by reinforcing the anti-imperialist peace movement, strengthening the grassroots demand that ΝΑΤΟ be disbanded...
(The President cut off the speaker)
<D>
(DE) Madam President, the scale of the crisis in Burma is horrific: 100 000 deaths, 200 000 people missing and more than two million homeless in a country of 54 million inhabitants.
The Irrawaddy Delta is Burma's largest rice-producing region and plays a key role in food production.
The tidal wave swept inland for 22 miles, flooding fields and leaving many of them heavily salinated.
In other words, the present humanitarian disaster is set to be compounded in the medium term by a food production crisis in the Irrawaddy Delta.
The people of Burma urgently need immediate as well as long-term help from the international community.
That help, unfortunately, must be forced through against the will of the generals, come what may.
A government blocking emergency aid is a scandal without precedent in the history of international relations.
The victims of the cyclone are being held hostage by a paranoid and murderous band of soldiers that has ruled Burma for several decades.
Last September the popular pro-democracy movement led by Buddhist monks was brutally crushed.
Thousands were killed or abducted, and now tens of thousands are dying because the government is not letting aid through.
Its refusal to accept aid for the people is killing them.
This murderous regime belongs at the very top of the United Nations' blacklist, and the members of the junta belong in the dock at the International Criminal Court.
<D>
(ET) Ladies and gentlemen, neither the European Union nor the UN suspends its election observation missions lightly; unfortunately we had to do so in Bangladesh.
In January the activity of democracy was suspended with the support of the military in a country whose two main parties, in the only example of its kind in the world, are led by women.
I admit that combating coercion and corruption is important for an effective economy and politics, although dirty methods such as suppressing demonstrations, gagging the press and undermining fair judicial proceedings may not be employed to that end.
For nearly twenty-five years Bangladesh has been moving towards the European model.
Secularism, hand in hand with religious tolerance, human rights and freedom of speech are values which our Parliament supports with all possible means.
We should therefore do all we can to put Bangladesh back on the road of democracy.
The technical assistance to organise elections and the bipartite working groups are the least the European Union can do.
We demand an immediate end to the state of emergency and to military intervention.
<D>
I am well aware that Mr Cohn-Bendit's thirst for knowledge knows no bounds.
Let me say to you that there was not one second in the entire process when this was in any doubt.
Nor was the matter raised at all during the open session at the summit meeting.
But this rumour was being spread in other circles.
Wherever I could, I acted immediately to quash it.
There can never be a situation where the European Council or any other body could withdraw the voting rights of the President of the European Parliament.
This is not about me personally but about the office of the President of Parliament.
I would vigorously oppose any such move, and the House is united on that stance.
(Applause)
<D>
(PL) Mr President, I would like to begin by saying that I appreciate the work undertaken by Mr Stockmann, the rapporteur, and by the Commission.
The competitiveness of the European economy calls for a transparent and rational approach to airport charges.
The latter are a significant component of the carriers' operational costs.
This issue concerns not only airport owners but also airlines and therefore passengers too.
Airports of national or continental importance are affected along with regional ones.
The question of the size limit arises.
Is the proposed amended criterion of 5 million passenger movements or 15% of passenger movements in a particular country appropriate?
In no circumstances should these provisions impact negatively on passengers.
The services provided by airports must comply with the criteria for safety and punctuality of arrivals, departures and transfers.
We are all aware that at the moment our airports differ considerably as regards punctuality culture.
In some of them the passenger is treated as a nuisance.
Improvements and better passenger service would be most welcome.
<D>
(NL) Everyone has been aware of the problems surrounding Lampedusa for years.
Capsized ships with unfortunate asylum seekers before the European coasts were, in recent years, a regular occurrence.
Tens of thousands of people try to reach Europe, enticed by unscrupulous human traffickers who are prepared to bring economic fortune hunters to Europe for huge sums of money.
I do not intend to mince my words, though, when I say that Lampedusa's plight is, first and foremost, the result of the failure of European immigration policy and should not be attributed to the Italian local authorities or the people of Lampedusa.
Europe should dare to send clear messages, for desperate times call for desperate measures.
We should come down hard on human traffickers, and their punishments cannot be severe enough.
This should go hand in hand with a strict asylum policy, one that demonstrates to the rest of the world that Europe is serious about protecting its borders.
Europe should follow the example of the Swiss, who decided two years ago to tighten up legal conditions for immigration and asylum.
It is the only way of sending human traffickers and economic fortune hunters a clear message that Europe is prepared to protect its borders to avoid social catastrophes.
Only then will a debate such as the one we are holding today prove unnecessary in future.
<D>
Madam President, the new impetus given to the Barcelona Process Mediterranean Union has been well presented by Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner and previous speakers.
The ideas of Barcelona are now even more pertinent than ever.
The prosperity gap between the European Union and most Mediterranean countries has unfortunately increased.
Gradual free trade with the European Union has not attracted the domestic and foreign investment needed to boost the standard of living of our Mediterranean partners.
A lot will depend now on the success of the new projects proposed, which must be visible and tangible to ordinary citizens on both sides of the Mediterranean, and affect and attract the interest of the private sector: projects dealing with topics such as civil protection, the effects of climate change, drought and the lack of water, forest fires, the de-pollution of the Mediterranean Sea, and the development of technology to make the best use of solar energy for the benefit of both sides of the Mediterranean.
Common projects for all Mediterranean countries, north and south, are one of the keys to success.
The issues of migration, social integration, justice and security are also of mutual benefit and visibility.
Let us not forget that our partners are now transit countries for the waves of migration from sub-Saharan Africa.
The question of funds, particularly with a more ambitious project such as this one, remains open.
The more tangible and visible the benefits of this project, the more willing the Member States will be to provide funds.
<D>
The result of the referendum in Ireland on the Treaty of Lisbon is a vital step in European integration and in strengthening the role of Europe.
The Treaty of Lisbon enables the EU to step up Europe's role in policies on energy, climate change, science and cooperation with developing countries.
The Treaty of Lisbon makes the fight against climate change a specific objective of EU environmental policy, acknowledging that it has a leading role, internationally, in the fight against climate change.
For the first time, a chapter will be included on energy, giving EU policy the objectives of achieving energy security, promoting energy efficiency and the development of renewable energy sources.
The Treaty of Lisbon lays the foundations for creating the European Research Area, strengthening European action in an area that is vital for economic growth and employment.
The Treaty of Lisbon introduces, for the first time, a specific legal basis for humanitarian aid, and states that the reduction and the eradication of poverty in developing countries is the primary objective of the Union's development cooperation policy.
<D>
The employment guidelines drawn up by the EU in collaboration with centre-left and centre-right governments have been enthusiastically contributed to by the European Parliament's political representatives of capitalism.
They promote the most barbarous exploitation of the working class in order to achieve the aim of the Lisbon Strategy, which is the unrestrained growth of profit for plutocrats.
At the centre of EU and government policy is the notorious 'flexicurity', which spells out the complete dismantling of labour relations.
The EU is using unemployment as a means of intimidating workers.
It is doing away with collective agreements and full-time steady employment.
These are being replaced with individualised employment contracts and mainly part-time jobs having precious little in the way of labour, wage, social, insurance or pension rights.
The EU aims to strike a decisive blow against state systems of social protection, insurance and pensions in all Member States.
In the mediaeval employment conditions being prepared by the EU, the 'model' employee as described in EU employment guidelines is an 'employable' person working under conditions of every conceivable form of part-time work.
He or she has no rights, having been trained and retrained in disposable skills according to the capitalist needs of the time.
He or she is constantly on the move in search of employment, works until advanced old age or even death, and provides untold riches to be plundered by the plutocracy.
<D>
The first amending budget for 2009 relates to the mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund for Romania, following the floods that hit that country in July 2008.
Faced with direct damage calculated at around EUR 471.4 million, it is (only now) planned to mobilise just EUR 11.8 million under this Fund, which once again clearly shows the urgent need for its revision.
The objective of this Fund is to enable the Community to respond in a rapid, efficient and flexible manner to 'emergency situations' in the various Member States.
That is why, despite all the inadequacies, we support its mobilisation for Romania.
However, the EUR 11.8 million allocated will be deducted from the budget line for the European Regional Development Fund (Convergence objective).
In other words, the 'solidarity' offered to Romania is being financed from funds intended for the least economically developed countries and regions, including Romania itself!
This is what can be termed as solidarity between the 'poor' or, in other words, between the so-called 'cohesion countries'/convergence regions ...
We disagree with 'cohesion' funds being used - all the more so at a time of worsening socio-economic crisis - when other funds are available, such as those intended for the militarisation of the EU.
<D>
in writing. - (HU) Over the past fifty years the population of the world has doubled, while energy consumption has quadrupled.
For this reason, there is no other option but to welcome the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking and provide all possible support for its establishment.
I understand Mrs Haug's concerns about the financing of the Joint Undertaking, but financial issues cannot be allowed stand in the way of this initiative.
The key words are innovation and change of lifestyle.
This, however, costs money, but on the other hand it will bring returns.
In modern economies, innovation accounts for 70-80% of annual GDP growth.
Why should we invest in hydrogen?
Because it is an intermediate source of energy.
'Supplies' cannot run out; it is the most abundant element in the universe.
It can only be considered an alternative to fossil fuels, however, if we can produce it from renewable energy sources at a competitive price, without emitting carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere in the process.
In Canada and the USA, the importance of hydrogen was recognised as far back as 2002.
Over there, several hundreds of thousands of 'eco-vehicles' are already on the road, and the number of filling stations with hydrogen pumps is steadily increasing.
In the European Union, around eighteen thousand eco-friendly vehicles are in operation, while the number of hydrogen pumps available is not even worth mentioning.
If we are to avoid the ultimate collapse, we cannot hold back support for this technology and fuel; we must take action.
I would like to use this opportunity to invite my fellow Members to my Greenovation conference, scheduled to take place in Parliament next week, on the afternoon of 28 May.
Following the discussions, participants will have the chance to take a ride in a hydrogen-powered bus or car.
<D>
(PL) Mr President, first and foremost I should like to thank Mr Borloo for his excellent preparation for the negotiations on the climate package and for steering them through to their conclusion.
Unfortunately things did not go well for the third energy package during the French Presidency.
I should like to take this opportunity of thanking Commissioner Piebalgs for his work in the first half of this year, however.
We did largely succeed in getting the third energy package through Parliament as well, thanks to constant discussions with the Commission and to the many amendments we tabled.
It is my view that in the climate package we have a problem with the unjustified windfall profits, as they have become known.
The main reason for this type of profits is the absence of a genuine market and of the relevant solutions.
For example, it is hard to imagine windfall profits in relation to the sale of vehicles, apples or oranges because in those cases there is a genuine market and such profits would be impossible.
That is why, having taken such a great step forward regarding protection of the natural environment in the climate package, we must now consider actions relating to the market.
It is our duty to do so.
The common market should bring us greater competition and energy security, which is what our customers are eagerly awaiting in particular.
I should like to pose a question to the French Presidency.
Did individual countries change their stance concerning the third energy package in the course of debate on the energy and climate package?
I ask this because it is now abundantly clear that it is imperative to complete work on the third energy package in order to implement the climate package.
<D>
Millions of Europeans rely on the Internet, whether directly or indirectly, in their daily lives.
Limiting, restricting or conditioning the Internet would have a direct and negative impact on the day-to-day lives of the general public and many of the micro-enterprises and SMEs which depend directly on this resource to carry out their business.
It was therefore important that our group's proposal be adopted, through our vote in favour, as this will maintain the freedom of exchanges between users, without these being controlled or sponsored by intermediaries.
However, it seems that the Council is not ready to accept this amendment, which is supported by a majority in Parliament who are against the limitation agreement reached in negotiations with the Council.
However, this is a small victory, given that it has prevented the adoption of a bad proposal.
All those who defend freedom of movement on the Internet and free software are to be congratulated.
This is a struggle with which we will continue in order to ensure the protection of citizens' rights and unrestricted access by end-users to services.
<D>
(BG) Madam President, Commissioner, bearing in mind the role played by trade in our globalizing world, we need to support the efforts to promote fair trade, and all initiatives which contribute to sustainable economic development.
Prices of raw materials affect market developments and in a number of cases have an aggravating effect on economic development, particularly in countries where deposits of raw materials are scarce.
This affects the overall market situation, and the availability of raw materials.
The expected high oil and electricity prices can and should be dealt with through effective technologies in both extraction and processing of raw materials.
This effectiveness and the implementation of innovations, as well as maintaining a strong research sector determine the level of success in improving the market situation and strength, in enhancing diversification and energy security.
In terms of agricultural trade, attention should focus on relaxing the pressure on producers caused by the imbalance between farmgate purchase prices of agricultural produce and their retail price levels.
This distorts the market but it also indicates that the market has its social cost.

Member of the Commission. - I had understood it was until 8 p.m., but, as I have already said, you have the chair and it is up to you to decide what I should do, so I shall continue.
The financial crisis which has also evolved into a macro-economic crisis has been the worst in post-Second World War history in terms of both magnitude and global coverage.
The crisis took a heavy toll on the global economy, including the EU and the euro area countries.
As such, it unavoidably affected Cyprus, a very small, open economy.
According to provisional estimates released by the Cypriot Statistical Service, the gross domestic product of Cyprus appears to have contracted by 1.7% in real terms in 2009.
This is the first time economic activity in Cyprus recorded a negative growth rate over the last 35 years.
These unfavourable economic conditions, coupled with the fading-out of the asset boom and an expansionary fiscal policy partly due to measures adopted within the framework of the European Economic Recovery Plan, led to a deterioration of the public finances.
According to the latest notification of GDP-related data from the Cypriot authorities transmitted in March 2010 and currently under validation by Eurostat, the general government balance reached a deficit of 6.1% of GDP and the general government gross debt attained 56.25% of GDP in 2009.
The Stability and Growth Pact requires the Commission to prepare a report whenever an actual or planned deficit of a Member State exceeds 3% of GDP reference value.
Currently, the Commission is in the process of preparing such a report for Cyprus.
Once the report is ready, it will be presented to the Council, which should decide whether the deficit is excessive.
If the Council concludes this is the case, it would make recommendations to Cyprus and would establish deadlines for effective corrective action to be taken.
In the meantime, the Cypriot Government has also sent its updated stability programme.
The programme spells out the medium-term budgetary strategy until 2013.
Currently, the Commission is in the process of assessing the update and preparing its recommendation for a Council opinion on the programme.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, as has already been mentioned, my colleague Ms Kroes had a small accident so that is why she cannot be with us.
On 4 November 2008 the Commission published, for consultation until 15 January, a draft new broadcast communication.
We are serious about the process of wide consultation.
Parliament's Committee on Culture and Education has scheduled a hearing for 5 March and, as has already been mentioned, the PPE-DE Group already held such a hearing on Thursday, last week, in the presence of the Director-General for Competition, Philip Lowe.
This dialogue between the Commission and Parliament is important.
We stand ready to listen and to reply to your questions.
We also know that Parliament agreed in September 2008 that state aid to public broadcasters should be delivered so that they fulfil their function in a dynamic environment, avoiding the use of public funding for reasons of political or economic expediency.
This concurs with our views; both public and private broadcasting are important.
The dual system of broadcasting is an answer to Europe's media landscape which must be safeguarded on all platforms.
The draft broadcasting communication therefore seeks to consolidate the Commission's state aid case practised since their existing 2001 communication.
The draft ensures that our rules reflect the rapidly changing new media environment.
The objective of modernising the communication is to increase transparency and legal certainty.
The draft communication clarifies that public broadcasters shall provide audiovisual services on all media platforms while leaving private operators sufficient incentives to stay in the market.
This is ensured by the so-called Amsterdam test, which balances the value and the negative effects of publicly financed media services at the national level.
Why do we have these tests?
Because having these tests at the national level helps to avoid Commission intervention.
The Commission increasingly receives complaints about borderline cases where a public media activity may have no clear value for citizens but where the market impact appears considerable.
The Commission, however, feels that repeated interventions in this sector would not be in the spirit of subsidiarity.
This is why we want Member Sates to share the Commission's responsibility for controlling the market impact of state finance media services.
The Amsterdam test will ensure that new media services of public broadcasters satisfy the social, democratic and cultural needs of viewers and listeners while limiting the collateral damage for state aid for private operators to a minimum.
We cannot agree that the Amsterdam test would involve an unjustifiable administrative burden.
Of course, any test involves work but the minimum effort we require is reasonable and necessary.
Firstly, the test is only foreseen for important and truly new services; and here our draft leaves a large margin of appreciation to Member States.
Each Member State can decide when a new audiovisual service actually merits being tested.
Secondly, the draft exempts pilot projects from the test.
Public broadcasters can therefore continue experimenting with new media without any preliminary tests.
Thirdly, the draft leaves Member States full freedom to choose their adequate procedures and institutions which apply the test.
It is finally worth mentioning that smaller Member States, such as Belgium and Ireland, already implement such tests.
The solutions found in these countries are proportionate to the resources available.
As the test is quite broad there is also no possibility of infringing on editorial freedom.
The test merely requires that a public media service satisfies the social, democratic and cultural needs of society and that its impact on the market is commensurate.
To safeguard editorial independence we also open the possibility in the draft that, under certain conditions, the test is done by a public broadcaster itself.
In summary, I would say the Amsterdam test should be seen as an opportunity rather than as a threat.
It will help to maintain media pluralism in the new media environment by safeguarding fairness and certainty for both commercial media, including online newspapers and our excellent public media.
<D>
(EL) Mr President, we do not agree with the political approach of this budget, because it increases military spending and because it slowly but surely merges its policy with NATO policy.
Essentially, this permanently excludes the potential for an independent EU foreign policy.
The five-year financial framework cuts agricultural spending and fails to support the household economy, cohesion and the fight to maintain the climate.
We want a European Union which passes legislation to protect consumers from speculation and citizens from the indiscriminate eye of authority.
We have all been turned into prima facie suspects.
I want to make one thing clear: we are against the budget, but our arguments are completely contrary to those we heard earlier from the non-attached members from the United Kingdom.
We believe in linking national interests and we do not accept that it is right for each nation to retreat into its shell.
That just leads to hostility and ultimately to conflict.
<D>
President-in-Office of the Council - Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honour for me to be with you today at the plenary of the European Parliament and to debate the products package.
The free movement of goods is undoubtedly one of the cornerstones of European integration.
I am very pleased that, in the year we are celebrating the 40th anniversary of the customs union and attention is centred on reviewing the operation of the internal market, we can add another stone to the mosaic of improved operation of the European market.
The free movement of goods is one of the areas where Slovenia first had contact with European legislation, so I am all the more pleased that, right at the time of the Slovenian Presidency, we will have an opportunity to confirm the agreement by means of this products package, which represents a new milestone in the building of the European Union's internal market.
I should mention that already this year, during the Slovenian Presidency, there have been about 30 or 35 meetings at all levels, and it is only mid-February.
At the end of November there were about 300 amendments to the text, for which we are grateful to everyone, especially those who devoted a considerable effort to achieving these results.
I agree that at first sight the products package seems very technical, but I am convinced that European companies are going to respond very clearly that this legislation is going to affect their business methods in the most direct manner.
This legislative package clearly informs the Member States what is and what is not permitted when dealing with products which companies wish to market.
On the other hand, companies will know what they can expect from national authorities.
They will know about procedures, how long the administration is likely to take to deal with their case when the products come under a category for which there is no harmonised Community legislation, and what the procedures are for possible withdrawal of such products from the market.
This is especially important for small and medium-sized enterprises which are disproportionately burdened by administrative procedures compared with other companies.
They will find that the new legislation makes these procedures much simpler and that the products package will benefit European companies.
There is no doubt about it.
However, and for me this is particularly important, it will also benefit European consumers.
The accreditation regulation on market surveillance has enabled us to strengthen market surveillance.
We will thereby ensure that consumers have the best possible access to safe products which will satisfy all requirements.
In the same way we will ensure that the surveillance of products entering the European Union from third countries is good and that, in future, we will avoid the presence on the European market of products that are harmful to the health of its citizens and, even worse, its children.
The procedures of the Member States for handling unsafe products are now much clearer.
The link with legislation relating to general product safety is also clear.
In my opinion, this will enable us in the most direct way to increase the confidence of our citizens in the internal market of the European Union.
Let me mention that the products package is also part of the effort to create a better legislative environment.
With the Decision on the common framework for the marketing of products, the European Commission and both legislators have a clear plan, or manual, the essential elements of which should be contained in the future technical legislation of the European Union.
This will make European Union legislation more comprehensible and it will be easier for the Member States to implement it.
I am convinced that the new legislation will contribute to more efficient organisation of national administration and enable businesses and citizens to operate more transparently.
It will strengthen and simplify cooperation among the Member States and thus contribute to better links between institutions for accreditation and surveillance of the European Union market.
Finally, allow me to thank the rapporteurs, Mrs Schaldemose, Mr Stubb and Mr Brie, for their exceptionally accommodating and constructive cooperation.
I would also like to thank the Commission and Commissioner Verheugen for their tireless support and advice in the shaping of the final agreement between the European Parliament and the Council.
All this has led, in an exceptionally short time, to the shaping of a harmonised and, in my opinion, excellent final text of all three debated documents.
I think that together we have proven that, where the well-being of European citizens and the European economy is concerned, European institutions are united and efficient.
Thank you for your efforts and your attention.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I am afraid I did not catch the interpretation of all of the last question that was put to me.
I got just the last fragment, which seemed to suggest that we had suspended the operation of the trade defence instruments and that we were no longer initiating or pursuing cases.
I do not quite understand the premise of the question, because any examination of DG Trade's website will be able to yield the information that the Member wants about cases that are currently being initiated and investigated and on which proposals will be brought forward in the ordinary way.
I do not complain about being accused of being unduly ambitious - that is the benchmark for what I do and how I set about my job.
If a Commissioner lacks ambition, then he or she is going to be judged, I think, by pretty low standards.
I am, however, not sufficiently ambitious to embrace straight away my friend Mr Schlyter's proposal of moving from my inability to propose consensual reforms of trade defence instruments against the low cost of production dumping to a new concept of organic or ecological dumping.
I think we will continue to concentrate on the former before we shift our focus to the latter, but I hope he does not take that as a sign of any lack of ambition on my part, only great realism.
Mr Caspary seemed to suggest that he was disappointed that proposals were not being brought forward.
Well, I can understand his disappointment, but I am really not sure that even this Parliament would have shown any greater ability to arrive at a simple consensual view about what reform should take place than the Member States have been able to achieve.
Mr Arif has suggested that my motivation is to play off consumers against workers and to play off importers against producers.
I am not playing anyone off against anyone - it is just that, in the real world, people do have different interests, and they have different viewpoints and different needs.
We do not yet live, I am afraid, in an ideal socialist society, where no one has a different view, no one has a different need and no one has a different interest.
I am afraid that we have to operate in the real world and we have to navigate our way through these interests and needs and arrive at a fair and equitable and acceptable outcome in our attempts to steer these policies forward.
I thought that Ms Mann's understanding of the dilemmas that we face in this policy area was very realistic.
It is not that I was seeking greater flexibility per se.
What I was seeking to do, in approaching this review, was to arrive at a set of trade instruments that were not fundamentally different or changed from those that we have at the moment, but that operated within a framework that was clearly understood, that were clearly predictable and clearly reasonable and balanced in their impact on the range of different businesses, which are trading in increasingly different circumstances in the global economy in the 21st century.
And I make no apology for doing that.
I would just say in conclusion, really in response to Mr Markov: yes it is probably an accurate summing-up that the system of trade defence that we have is not the best, but it is the one we have got.
I think that is a fair description of our system.
The questions that I had to put and that remain to be answered were not whether our system is the best - it probably is not, but it is, nonetheless, the one we have got and it is in reasonable working order.
I had to ask, will it remain workable, in the way that it is now, in the future?
Will it become increasingly controversial and contested amongst European businesses in the future?
Will it fit the changing production models and supply chains of increasing numbers of European businesses that are becoming far more internationalised and that will continue to do so more than ever before?
Those are the questions that I put.
They have not yet been satisfactorily answered, but answers, I think, will remain to be found and we need to continue seeking them.
<D>
The Treaty of Lisbon refers to consumer protection as an overarching and fundamental policy of the European Union, which establishes that consumer protection requirements must be taken into account.
In this context, it is essential to strengthen European consumer protection policy and to render it more effective and meaningful for the public.
It is crucial to respond to the needs and problems of the European public.
In this sense, instruments for monitoring the market, such as the Consumer Markets Scoreboard, are justified.
A good consumer protection policy must ensure healthy markets, and security and confidence, whereby cross-border trade and innovation are encouraged.
I advocate a transparent policy where brand name of origin is obligatory.
Consumer protection is important in the face of imported products that are unsafe, and this requires closer cooperation between market monitoring authorities and customs authorities.
The safety of products circulating in the domestic market requires a combination of efforts with the authorities of third countries, and therefore justifies the Commission's initiative to step up international cooperation and sign formal agreements with the relevant authorities of third countries, especially China, the US and Japan.
<D>
in writing. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I strongly oppose this report.
From the outset I have expressed my opposition to the way the Treaty of Lisbon has been devised and ratified.
In fact, I believe that a Treaty cannot simply be ratified by the national parliaments, but it needs a referendum.
Then, looking at the merits of the text itself, I totally disagree with some sections.
In particular, in the third indent of paragraph 6, I utterly deplore the reference to Italy, though implicit.
In fact, the text expresses regret about 'the extra parliamentary seat attributed to a Member State in derogation of the principle of degressive proportionality'.
The truth is, this is all completely false.
With this attribution, even if it comes in the form of an extra seat, discrimination orchestrated to harm Italy has been partially revived.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, this was, of course, a very important discussion.
Why?
Because there is a huge civil society in Iran that certainly would like to have a different way of life, but there is still a very difficult regime.
I think we all know that the nuclear issue is the huge stumbling block at this moment.
It spoils all the possibilities for development and also for a bilateral relationship, which would have very great potential.
This is what I said repeatedly to Mr Jalili: 'Why do you not take this?
Why is there no possibility of entering into a dialogue with you?
Why do you not show some political will on this?'
I think this is what we have to do - try to appeal to the population as well, to see if there is perhaps a chance to change things at the next elections - knowing that it will be very difficult.
But I think it is interesting to see that the Opposition is, at least, coming together again.
It has been split.
It has been in a resigned mood.
Now there is, at least, a new will to go for elections and perhaps change the situation, at least of the Government.
But of course, as I said before, the screening of the candidates by the Council of Guardians is now under way and is crucial.
As Ms Beer said, if 7 000 candidates can run for 290 seats, too many candidates have already been rejected.
Two thousand of them will have been rejected.
Therefore I strongly hope that an appeals procedure will indeed redress the situation.
The Iranian electorate deserves to be able to choose its representatives from amongst a wide spectrum of parties and opinions.
Of course it is clear that we are not supporting any specific party, but it is important that there is the establishment of a genuine pluralism.
Having said this, I completely agree with all those - and I did not go into all the details - who said that we have to do a lot on the human rights front, even if we cannot go forward with regard to the nuclear issue.
We have, of course, supported all the UN resolutions; Canada has introduced such a resolution.
This has been adopted, clearly showing where Iran - unfortunately - stands today.
I would like to say, to some of the Members of Parliament who have mentioned that we should use the EIDHR instrument, that we are already using it via implementation through the UN, UNICEF and UNODC: for instance in the areas of juvenile justice and young people addicted to drugs, and on the question of justice.
But it becomes more and more complicated in this very rigid atmosphere.
I have been trying to have one diplomat in one Embassy in Tehran, to ensure a smoother coordination of joint projects.
This is, of course, only a small step, but hopefully a meaningful one, which could pave the way, at least a little, for the development of our cooperation.
Unfortunately, however, Iran remains evasive.
Last week, when I personally mentioned this, I did not receive an answer.
<D>
(FR) Mr President, thank you for Sète.
There are indeed fisheries resources, and a new monitoring system, which we are debating this evening, but above all there are fishermen, their jobs and their livelihoods, and being a fisherman is the hardest job in the world.
It is not that of an official or elected representative, and it shapes men who are free, but desperate today, hence the uprisings of the tuna fishermen in the Mediterranean, in Sète, in Le Grau-du-Roi, and the irate fishermen in Boulogne, in France.
We have regulated their fishing since 1983, so for 26 years.
However, since the entry into force of the Treaty of Rome, Articles 32 to 39 on the CAP have also related to them, and the very first Community regulation on fishing came into force in 1970.
For 39 years we have been legislating: on the shock of the arrival of Spain in 1986, and of Denmark in 1993, on gillnets, driftnets, fishery agents, total allowable catches, quotas, aid, fleet restructuring, and modernisation.
We legislate on sanctions, biological rest periods, stocks, discards, monitoring systems, humans, species, cod, hake, bluefin tuna, and even international agreements, and now, on recreational fishing!
What is more, it is still not working.
Blue Europe is becoming greyer and greyer.
Why?
Because fishing is part of the 21st-century global food challenge; it is at global level that it will have to be managed.
Like the financial crisis, pandemics, climate change, immigration and serious crime, fish are alter-globalists.
They respect neither borders nor Community law.
Europe is too small to regulate fisheries resources, and, from Peru to Japan, Moscow to Dakar, Ireland and Valencia, we are going to need regulations on the global shared ownership of fisheries resources.
That is the path, Mr President, that Brussels must also take.
<D>
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the text on which we are about to vote constitutes a good compromise and considerably improves the Commission's initial proposal.
Our aim is still to launch a reform geared to revitalising the sector on both the domestic and international markets.
Global demand is not falling, but rising, so the right approach is not to produce less but to invest in the quality and character of European wines, in cutting costs, in promoting wine so as to expand the market and in helping young people to establish vineyards.
It is equally necessary to limit the reduction in European wine production, as proposed by the Commission, by increasing the Member States' autonomy to govern the grubbing-up scheme.
We must avoid destroying vineyards which, while perhaps not having a particularly strong market position, produce high-quality regional wines, have well-established historical traditions and even today make up the social fabric of entire regional areas.
Despite creating the conditions for greater competitiveness, this reform must retain links with the past and promote the continuation of wine-growing as a factor in preserving the land and the environment.
We are therefore in favour of allocating the earmarked resources over three years rather than five and distributing them primarily on the basis of historical data, broadly according to the same criterion used for all other reforms adopted until now.
Commissioner, we are opposed to the liberalisation of new oenological practices and the use of imported must to enrich our wines or blend them with third country wines, because we believe that this could be detrimental to the wine's image and could compromise the consumer's trust in the product, with extremely serious consequences for consumption.
On the other hand, we think it is vital to provide aid for concentrated musts and rectified concentrated musts used for enrichment purposes, so as to protect an oenological practice common in many Community regions.
We believe that investment by producers must be borne in mind and that any disruptions to trade flows which could increase available supplies must be avoided.
This reform must encourage the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin, as a means of better guaranteeing and protecting European wines in the context of multilateral negotiations and bilateral trade agreements.
Finally, Commissioner, we are against the full liberalisation of planting rights from 2014 onwards for wines with designations of origin and geographical indications, and we can endorse the rapporteur's proposal that the new reform should enter into force on 1 August 2009.
<D>
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a Minister of the Interior of a European country may not describe a debate in the European Parliament as grotesque.
It is a statement that undermines the dignity of the European Parliament.
We are not happy about a measure of the Italian Government having to be appraised in this house.
For us, Europe is not the scapegoat for all national problems, nor is it the gendarme having to keep watch over the Prime Minister of Italy.
We believe, even when we are in opposition in our country, that it is right to uphold and defend in international circles the sound choices that Italy makes.
The Italian Government and the Interior Minister should, however, have looked for other means, fully in line with European standards, and informed the European Commission beforehand rather than late in the day.
We have been endeavouring to tackle the Roma issue for years: exploitation of minors, begging, racketeering, robbery and other pathological phenomena.
But the solution is not ethnic profiling, but rather a specific policy that brings together the three pillars of citizenship, decency and security.
The identification of Roma children and not them alone is a guarantee for those involved and essential for combating racketeering and trafficking in minors, but it may not be done on an ethnic basis using invasive methods such as fingerprinting.
We are grateful to Commissioner Špidla for his commitment to give a European response to a major European issue and we ask him to speak clearly about the measures adopted by the Italian Government and to report to the European Parliament.
It is surprising that the third millennium, which should have heralded the dawn of a new era for citizens' rights, has in fact descended to the depths of cultural regression.
Let the European institution itself stand up against rampant conformism, in defence of the values of decency that Europe represents in the world.
<D>
in writing. - (FR) Strengthening the competitiveness of the European defence industry, which is supposedly damaged by European markets that are too narrow and too closed in on themselves, has served as a pretext for this Directive on the opening up to competition of public contracts in this sector.
True, the text that is today being submitted to us does take account of a number of problems raised by the Commission's initial text, such as its scope, the non-application of the WTO agreement on public contracts, the financial thresholds and confidentiality.
However, it is in keeping with the logic of Brussels, whereby no sector, not even strategic or vital ones, can be exempt from its supervision, from liberalisation or from privatisation.
It does not guarantee respect for Member States' sovereignty, even though they alone are legally responsible for their national security.
It does not encourage the existence of far-reaching markets in Europe, where the States' defence budgets are drastically reduced.
It does not introduce any system of Community preference, which alone would enable a true European market to emerge naturally.
It strengthens the civilian/military dichotomy, which is so specific to Europe and which has already cost us so dearly.
Above all, it puts economic and market considerations above everything else.
These serious flaws on key points are the reason for our opposition.
<D>
We must implement a policy of good governance, both within and outside the European Union, not least to oppose unfair tax competition, particularly with those countries that represent tax havens.
Transparency and the physical exchange of information are the foundations of fair competition and of a fair distribution of the tax burden.
Moreover, good tax governance is an important pre-condition for preserving the integrity of financial markets.
The motions on administrative cooperation and on mutual assistance for recovery, which we are adopting in this plenary session, are taking us in this direction.
At the international level, one of the instruments that the EU can use to promote good governance in tax matters in third countries is to negotiate tax fraud agreements with them, which include a clause on an exchange of information.
The statements of the five countries with which the EU has a savings agreement (Monaco, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Andorra and San Marino) are an important step towards the end of a situation of complete imbalance.
Such statements must, however, be followed by the conclusion of legally binding agreements.
The EU must also act as a driving force in this sector, setting a good example and following through what the G20 summit has already set in motion.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - I have two questions today on the budget reform, one more general and one more concentrated on agricultural matters.
I am very happy to have at least two questions because we were asking for more interest from Parliament.
In response to the first question, this is more general and concerns more the delivery and efficiency of European budget delivery.
Part of the public consultation concentrated specifically on how to make delivery of the European budget more efficient, faster, simpler and more transparent.
The public consultation has made a strong call for the improved effectiveness and efficiency of the European budget, in particular through the simplification and proportionality of the administrative budget and control.
In this context, a number of issues were identified, some of which are already taking concrete shape in the Commission.
Among those initiatives which are already in place is the European Transparency Initiative.
Thanks to this initiative, the Commission has already provided a first response to the need for increased openness and accessibility to the budget.
Some other issues mentioned in the consultation deserve our serious attention.
The first is the integration of expenditures currently outside the budget - the so-called budgetisation of the funds.
This would obviously increase synergies, legitimacy and administrative simplification, but we have not been very successful over the years.
You are aware of this with regard to some funds.
The responsibilities of the Member States are another important element.
It is important to further strengthen the responsibilities of Member States, who manage over 80% of the European budget, particularly in areas under shared management.
A clearer allocation of responsibilities between Member States and the Commission is needed.
This will also hopefully be partly improved if we have the Lisbon Treaty in place.
The third element is the rigidity of our budget.
The current European budget is still rather too rigid, recent examples being the negotiations for the food facility or the European recovery plan, especially in the current environment.
Then we have problems with the gas supply in Europe where we are not able to deliver or have an agreement between the Member States to invest in future projects such as interconnections or gas storage.
That again shows how much we need to invest in the European budget's operational capacities to react.
The third group of problems which has been mentioned in the consultations concerned minimising the administrative burden.
The Commission has also already made various commitments.
In the action plan towards an integrated internal control framework, the Commission has committed itself to making proposals for simplified rules on cost eligibility issues.
This includes extending the use of lump sums or flat-rate payments wherever this is appropriate.
In its recent communication on tolerable risk, the Commission proposes to redefine the control system in terms of risk objectives and an acceptable level of error.
We hope for the support of the Parliament in these political discussions and later in negotiations with the Council.
The Commission looks forward to the Parliament's support in general in rationalising and simplifying budget delivery and then in examining future legislation in general.
I thank you for the questions.
This is the least attractive question we usually receive because it is sometimes treated as being too technical.
No matter how good the political decisions being made are, good politics can fail if we do not have efficient delivery mechanisms.
<D>
Our next question comes from Mrs Kadenbach, who is replaced tonight by Mr Arsenis.
Subject: EU Biodiversity Strategy
In 2010, the International Year of Biodiversity, the European Council adopted an ambitious 2050 vision and 2020 target for biodiversity conservation in the EU.
Subsequently, under the Convention on Biological Diversity, the world's governments adopted an ambitious global vision and 2020 mission for biodiversity conservation, and a Strategic Plan setting out 20 testing targets.
When does the Commission expect to publish an EU Biodiversity Strategy, setting out the ambitious measures needed to achieve the EU and global biodiversity conservation targets?
Can the Commission confirm that the new Strategy will call for no further negative changes in the conservation status of all protected habitats and species across the EU, both within and outside Natura 2000 sites, by 2020, with a view to restoring all habitats and species to favourable conservation status by 2050?
Other than ongoing training for judges, and guidance documents previously announced by the Commission, what concrete measures are planned to improve the implementation of EU environmental law?
Does the Commission have any plans to set up an EU environmental inspection force and adopt legislation on environmental inspections, as called for by Parliament?
<D>
(HU) Thank you, Mr President.
As the MDF MEP, I have voted in favour of the creation of the European Soil Protection Directive because I am convinced that it is necessary.
Without an appropriate amount of good-quality soil, European agriculture too will be jeopardised.
I trust that, if this legislation is created, an opportunity will open up for us to work using Union resources on cleaning soil from pollution and protecting its quality.
However, at this point I would like to draw the attention of the Member States to the fact that this is possible only if the Member States also take their duties seriously.
In my home country, for example, the action mostly amounts to the preparation of plans, and their implementation drags along.
There is a national remedial programme in Hungary, but not a word about consistent implementation of it.
The government does not guarantee the necessary resources.
EUR 18 million is earmarked for the future, which is risible in comparison with the scale of the problem.
At this rate, we would need more than 220 years to finish cleaning up the soil pollution we know about today.
Let us be more serious, please!
Thank you.
<D>
Madam President, the topic of urban transport, I would like to inform the honourable Members - 'fellow Members' always comes to my mind first, it must be force of habit; I have only been a commissioner for a few months whereas I was an MEP for many years and evidently I still feel part of this Parliament - was one of the topics at the informal Council in La Rochelle on 1 and 2 September 2008, and was discussed at length.
The Commission and the Member States gave the issue a great deal of attention, inviting experts, mayors of large and medium-sized cities and specialists in the sector to talk about urban transport.
I spoke on this subject myself at the Road Safety Day that took place a few days ago in Paris - the official Commission and Council day during Road Safety Week - emphasising that road safety must also mean a good urban transport system: our roads will become safer, above all in big cities, if there is a good urban transport system.
In my view, this will inevitably reduce the number of victims of accidents that occur in big cities, where there is the greatest number of accidents and the greatest number of victims.
The Commission is drawing up an action plan on urban mobility based on the consultations that followed the publication of the Green Paper.
We intend to present the plan before the end of this year.
This plan will include proposals for definite actions at European Union level for the coming years.
Clearly the European Commission does not have jurisdiction on this: these are areas that concern the Member States, but we, on the basis of the principle of subsidiarity which, as you all know, is derived from the word subsidium, want to help the Member States and the mayors of large cities.
The former mayor of Milan, Gabriele Albertini, Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, can testify to all this: through this action plan, we will ensure that all of the information we have, all of the advice, all of the ideas, all of the suggestions, can be made available to all cities, above all the big cities with traffic problems.
The action plan will also assist policy makers at local, regional and national level, in full respect - I repeat, full respect - of the principle of subsidiarity.
The actions we will propose will help to cut costs, to guarantee the proper funding of the single market and to create new markets for new technologies, developing sustainable urban mobility.
It is no coincidence that only yesterday evening, the debate was concluded and a vote taken on a directive that should encourage, that is aimed at encouraging, local authorities to purchase means of public transport with reduced harmful gas emissions.
Today, however, it is still too early to outline or be specific about the content of the action plan, but we nonetheless expect, and you can expect, it to cover the breaking up of rules on access to green areas, urban goods transport and logistics, better information on public transport systems in European cities or broad plans on sustainable urban mobility and proposals on ways to integrate urban planning and mobility.
The action plan may also include proposals on information sharing and for improved data collection and research practices, and may even tackle the issue of funding, which is an extremely delicate question.
This, I repeat, will all be based on respect for the principle of subsidiarity.
<D>
(EL) Mr President, in order correctly to assess the report by the two rapporteurs, Mr Severin and Mr Lamassoure, we need to take into account certain facts and to apply certain rules.
First of all, we must approach the report in a European manner, not a nationalistic one.
If we fail to do so, we will be faced with competition over which country gets more seats and which fewer.
Secondly, we must take into account certain facts, for example the European Parliament is not deciding today on the composition of Parliament, but is making a proposal to the Council.
The Council has a certain margin and foundation on which to build, even it is based on the past, which we may think is not particularly well-balanced.
In addition to this, we have to apply the arithmetical facts we have been given.
There are 750 MEPs, 96 per country at most and 6 per country as a minimum.
We cannot also start bargaining about parts of the population which are inside and outside.
We ought to reach a compromise based on the existing situation in line with the population and with what applies to other sectors.
We are not here to re-found the EU.
When we do, let us use different calculations.
What matters today, therefore, is that we reach a result which has the widest possible support from the European Parliament, so that we retain our credibility and at the same time open up the way for European and not nationalistic movements.
Let me appeal here to the esteemed Germans, who have always been generous; besides, if in the past they had displayed the tendency they have today we would have no EU.
I also appeal to my fellow Members from the other states, so that tomorrow we can adopt the Lamassoure and Severin report with the greatest possible majority.
<D>
President of the Commission. - First of all, I have stated several times in this Parliament and on other occasions that we are against any kind of competing or parallel divisions of institutions in the European Union.
We have one Union, the European Union, with our institutions, with the 27 Member States today, and of course we fully respect the treaties.
We can, in the current framework, do more for economic coordination and clearance.
We have, namely, Article 121 of the treaty that is clear in stating that Member States' economic policies are a matter of common concern.
What a Member State does has implications in the other Member States.
Article 121 is an implicit call for coordination by Member States.
We have Article 126 that deals specifically with budgetary policies, and Article 136 allows the Commission to take initiatives to reinforce coordination, also within the euro area but within the general Community framework.
This is the important point to understand.
We can make some proposals for the euro area, but always within the framework of the European Union, and not having the euro area as something separate from the rest of the European Union.
I believe this is critically important for the success of a Union that is really based on the principle of solidarity.
<D>
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, beyond congratulating Mr Romeva i Rueda on his report, I would like to address the content in the wider context of the common fisheries policy.
In the last 10 years I have heard many criticisms of it, including the lack of a level playing field, insufficient stakeholder involvement, inadequate balancing of economic, social and environmental imperatives and too much by way of micro-management from the centre.
Recently, though, I have been able to assure people that the policy is undergoing significant change.
Of course there is still a long way to go - eliminating discards, for example - and there are times when the Commission still seems to veer towards micro-management.
I mention here Article 47 of the control regulation, at least in its original version.
I have often said, though, that the common fisheries policy is a bit like an oil tanker: it takes a considerable time to turn round, and I do believe that the control regulation will go a long way to achieving the necessary level playing field where enforcement and sanctions are concerned, just as the development of regional advisory councils shall do much to bring improvements in other respects.
So I would like to finish on a personal note, by expressing my appreciation of the valuable work done by members of the Fisheries Committee throughout and by thanking Commissioner Borg and his team for all that has been achieved in their five years at the helm.
<D>
in writing. - (RO) Undeclared work is a phenomenon encountered in all EU Member States and an alarming feature of the European economic market, which goes against flexicurity principles.
The fight against undeclared work is somehow similar to the duel between Microsoft and hackers.
The more innovative our methods to fight undeclared work are, the more efficient the tricks used by the employers become.
And the best example of this is the emergence of "grey labour” when employers would rather enter into employment contracts for the minimum guaranteed wages while the rest of the money up to the real wages is paid without using legal forms.
In Romania, the phenomenon has become more and more extensive and currently grey labour accounts for 20 - 50% of total employment.
The alarming fact is that, if at the beginning the users of this method were small enterprises, now there are well known names which avoid taxes and social security contributions resulting in a very small pension for the employee which will bring him/her close to the poverty threshold.
I have emphasised these aspects because the future strategy for fighting undeclared work as mentioned in the report must take into account the specific situation in each Member State.
We need a unified European approach and efficient collaboration between the governmental agencies, labour inspectorates and the social partners.
<D>
Madam President, honourable Members, I, too would like to begin by expressing thanks, in this case to the rapporteur, Mr Schwab, and to those Members of this House who participated in the preparatory work, for their truly constructive and engaged cooperation, which makes agreement right at the first reading possible.
What we are actually dealing with here is what appears to be a very technical regulation, yet it is a regulation with a large and far-reaching political significance.
What we are aiming to adopt today represents a milestone when it comes to improving road safety.
This regulation will make European cars safer.
It is a milestone in terms of the environmental compatibility of European vehicles, as environmental compatibility, of course, is something that will not only be achieved through producing more fuel-efficient engines - cars also offer other entirely different options for saving fuel and reducing pollution.
At the end of the day, it will also form an important part of our policy of better lawmaking, as it will lead to a truly drastic simplification of the entire regulatory environment.
Allow me to begin with the aspect of safety, which was the most important element in this project.
Road safety in Europe is still an issue that demands our earnest attention and that causes us great concern.
The rules that we are laying down here, and that will apply as standard to European cars from 2011, will lead to 35 000 fewer deaths and serious injuries a year on Europe's roads.
The introduction of the electronic stability programme for passenger cars and for commercial vehicles, in particular, can save almost 3 000 lives a year and prevent serious injuries for 25 000 people.
This is, ultimately, a piece of safety equipment which, especially when it comes to goods vehicles, which are often involved in serious accidents, has only rarely been used up to now.
The costs to manufacturers will be far outweighed by the overall economic benefit.
This package of measures will play a considerable part in implementing the European Strategy to reduce CO2 emissions from passenger cars and light commercial vehicles.
It makes low rolling resistance tyres mandatory and requires the installation of tyre pressure monitoring systems and gear shift indicators.
These measures will reduce average CO2 emissions by 6 to 7 grams of CO2 per kilometre.
That is, therefore, a really very noteworthy contribution.
What is more, I do not wish to miss the opportunity to point out that this proposal will lead to a significant reduction in noise pollution from roads since reducing tyre noise levels will bring about a significant improvement in this situation.
Allow me, at this point, to stress once again that we can only achieve sustainable mobility in Europe if, as part of an integrated approach, we include the potential of all the factors that are involved here, which means the vehicle itself - which is what we are discussing today - but we also have to discuss the transport infrastructure and the driving behaviour of the people involved.
I am very pleased that that is exactly how the European Parliament sees it.
As for simplifying the legislation, this regulation will bring about an impressive simplification of the regulatory environment.
This single regulation will rescind 50 existing directives and, wherever possible, replace them by international rules.
Lower administration costs, better transparency and greater international harmonisation will mean noteworthy savings for the industry, and that will help reinforce its competitiveness.
At the same time, the Member States will benefit from reduced spending on administration.
When it comes to cars, it is scarcely possible not to mention the fact that the European motor industry currently finds itself in a very serious crisis, the most serious for decades.
It is natural, therefore, to wonder whether this is the right time to be implementing technical regulations.
Let me be quite clear in my response to that, when I say that what we are aiming to adopt here today is one of the results of the CARS 21 process, in which we worked intensively with manufacturers, the Member States and civil society on how the framework for the European motor industry will look in future and how we envisage the European car of the future.
I would like to emphasise strongly that, even in this crisis - and specifically in this crisis, in fact - European manufacturers must not slacken off when it comes to developing and bringing onto the market cars that meet the requirements of the early 21st century, and those requirements are quite clear.
Consumers want vehicles that use less fuel, are better for the environment and are safer.
The vision for the European car of the future that resulted from CARS 21, and the common line of all the participants when it came to the future of this industry, is exactly that - what we want is for Europe to send out to face the international competition not only qualitatively the best cars, but also those that consume the least, are the most environmentally friendly and the safest, and I am absolutely convinced that, with products like that, the European industry will retain its leading position in the international vehicles market.
Thank you very much.
<D>
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am happy to see that the issue of developments in Russia has found its way into the debates in plenary.
There is no doubt that good mutual relations with the Russian Federation are a precondition for a strong European Union in the future.
I very much regret that the elections in Russia did not take place without any interference from the authorities.
On the other hand what we are lacking, like so many times before, is a simple demonstration of basic respect, on our part, for the work that has been carried out and for the culture of the nation and the country we are discussing today.
Without a shadow of a doubt Russia is still a long way from reaching the level of social justice and quality of life that we would like to see all over the world.
It has difficulty coping with its demographic crisis.
On the other hand, for the first time in Russian history the highest country's representative is leaving the Kremlin voluntarily and his successor has been chosen by the people.
There is no doubt that political technologies, tools and management methods, including voting procedures, have been tuned to perfection in Russia.
These technologies, however, have been imported from the West.
I want to ask those who today cry over the plight of democracy in Russia whether they are also upset about the European Parliament's somewhat cowardly refusal to ask how Mr Solana handles international law?
<D>
(PT) Madam President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, at the beginning of this legislative term, one of the central issues under debate was the institutional issue.
We started with the Treaty of Nice and, five years later, it will still be the Treaty of Nice that we have to use to take some important decisions.
The re-election of President José Manuel Barroso, which I of course support, is certainly one of those decisions.
I still hope that the Treaty of Lisbon can quickly enter into force, not only because of its virtues and the improvements from which it has benefited over time, but also to allow the institutional debate to be stabilised.
I especially hope that our energies can then be better used for and directed at the Europe of results, of which the Commission President spoke and has always spoken.
If, in the next referendum, the Irish say yes, it will be more because they have realised that Europe is a safe harbour, particularly in times of crisis.
The current situation is therefore our most powerful ally, but it could also be our most fearsome adversary.
Nowadays, Europe's modern promise is particularly one of prosperity and well-being for everyone, and this promise greatly depends on what we are capable of deciding, including at the next European Council.
We particularly need the political will to respond to the current economic situation.
Protectionism, nationalisation and fear of globalisation will not help us.
We need to release and create space for the forces that can build our economies, we need to insist on reforms and compliance with the law, and of course we need to support the most vulnerable.
In this way we can achieve a Europe of results, without the abstraction from which people will inevitably remain alienated.
Now as I am leaving Parliament, Madam President, it is this hope that I want to express, and it is this hope that encourages me.
<D>
The next item is the joint debate on the four reports dealing with taxation.
We have here:
the report by Mrs Alvarez on administrative cooperation in the field of taxation,
the report by Mr Dumitru Stolojan on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims relating to taxes, duties and other measures,
the report by Mr Casa on an optional and temporary application of the reverse charge mechanism in relation to supplies of certain goods,
the report by Mr Domenici on promoting good governance in tax matters,
I will give the floor to Mrs Alvarez, the rapporteur, for four minutes.
<D>
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should firstly like to congratulate Mr Foglietta for his excellent work: his report very effectively tackles a tragically topical issue, that of alcohol abuse, in particular by minors.
It has already been said that the aim is in no way to criminalise consumption of alcohol which, when taken in moderate quantities, may well have health benefits.
The aim is rather to take a strong line against the spread of alcohol consumption among the very young.
Alcohol is often taken with drugs or alcohol itself may end up as a drug.
Alcohol abuse is now a social emergency among young people because it brings with it very serious physical and psychological damage, not to mention the victims of road accidents which are increasingly being caused by drink-drivers.
In Europe, Italy is sadly in the lead here with the highest number of road traffic accidents, half of whose victims are young people aged under thirty.
In the majority of cases, they lose their lives at weekends, during the evening, during the night, often returning from a party or a discotheque after consuming excessive amounts of alcohol.
In conclusion, Mr President, this is an excellent report, whose line we support as it is capable of reconciling prevention of the problem with appropriate action in terms of education and information and with zero tolerance for those failing to abide by the rules.
<D>
(RO) In order to best use the opportunities provided by globalization, the European Union should modernize its social policies and invest mainly in human resources.
Starting in the '90s, expenses of social protection have remained around 28% of the gross domestic product.
During 2000-2007, the number of jobs increased by 13 million, while the unemployment rate decreased from 9% to 7%.
At the same time, approximately 80 million European citizens are below the poverty threshold.
The poverty risk among children is 19% in the European Union.
The Lisbon Treaty emphasizes the importance for the European Union to have a social market economy.
Social changes that take place in the context of globalization refer to unemployment, the reform of the pension system, the reform of taxation systems, fighting poverty and invetsments in education and the child care system.
Education could play a vital role in compensating for the socio-economic disadvantage and for opening the way for children's succesful development.
Member States should also improve their health systems and fight poverty among the elderly as well.
<D>
Serbia's future lies in the EU.
I therefore welcome Serbia's application for membership of the European Union, submitted on 22 December 2009, and the decision taken by the Council of Ministers on 25 October 2010 to ask the Commission to examine Serbia's application.
I would congratulate Serbia on the progress achieved in the reform process.
I would stress that the development of regional cooperation remains a key priority for the EU and is intended as a catalyst for reconciliation, good neighbourliness and enhanced people-to-people contacts in the Western Balkans.
I therefore call on Serbia to adopt a constructive approach towards more inclusive regional cooperation.
I would point out that full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) is a fundamental condition for Serbia to progress on the path to EU membership.
It should be noted that Serbia continues to respond adequately to ICTY requests for assistance.
I call on the Serbian Government to continue working closely with the Tribunal, including swift transmission of all requested documents and timely completion of cases transferred back from the ICTY.
<D>
- Madam President, in the current difficult economic climate, this report brings the kind of joined-up thinking that is desperately needed.
VAT reductions will help most the people who need it most - the people who earn less than others.
I believe this report is also about job creation, and that is why I supported it.
It is about making sure that jobs do not disappear into the black economy.
I hope that it will be implemented quickly, especially in my region, in the West Midlands.
We also need to stress that we have to allow Member States to reduce VAT on certain items to battle against climate change.
Providing people with an incentive to 'buy green' is exactly the kind of market-based instrument that will reap the greatest benefits.
VAT reductions across the world are used to encourage people to buy energy-efficient and environmentally-friendly fridges, freezers and other goods that use up large amounts of energy, and cheaper prices for these products will help the less well-off.
My Government in the UK has taken the lead on this issue by reducing VAT by 2.5% until 2010, and I hope other Member States will also follow suit.
<D>
(RO) For the near festival organized by the European Parliament as part of the intercultural dialogue, each country was requested to produce a film on this theme.
From what I understand, Romania's initial proposal was not accepted for the reason of not answering to the theme, but the production replacing it, namely the film California Dreaming, has even bigger shortcomings.
The first one is that it answers even less to the theme, despite its opening night at Cannes, mystifying the reality and altering my country's image.
While all the other films transpose the intercultural dialogue at a personal, human level, the film California Dreaming relates an imaginary case of an American transport through Romania, which is stopped by the local authorities and ends in a civil war.
Moreover, the film is pigmented with obscene language, and scenes of explicit sex and violence, a unique case in the festival.
I don't believe all these are virtues of the intercultural dialogue.
But the biggest shortcoming is that, apparently, this film was not selected by the Romanian party, but by the European Parliament public servants.
If this is true, the situation is serious, because an apolitical concept, such as the intercultural dialogue, is consciously politicized for obscure reasons, thus damaging the image of a European Union Member State.
Consequently, I request the European Parliament to examine this matter.
<D>
(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, the debate that is taking place today concerns one of the most important matters that the European Union, and certainly the European Parliament, is engaged in: observance of human rights in the world, and monitoring the current state of global democracy.
The two reports seem to me to represent a very significant achievement by the European Parliament.
I would like to record my congratulations to Mr Cappato and to Mrs De Keyser and Mr Salafranca on drawing up these reports.
In such situations we are always faced with the following dilemma: how can we defend human rights, speak about the principles of law that we wish to demonstrate in other regions of the world, and at the same time conduct an effective EU policy?
This is the basis of the art of EU policy today: balancing these two principles, demonstrating the vista of human rights and, at the same time, the effectiveness of our policy.
This is the stark issue facing us today in Burma, in China, in the Caucasus, and in very many regions of the world.
It seems to me that the two reports make a very good attempt to balance these two challenges facing the European Union.
One more matter: I would like to use this debate to thank Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner for her answer in the matter of observing human rights in Mongolia.
My information turned out to be correct.
Mongolia may be an example of a country in which we really are dealing with a positive trend in the field of human rights.
Mongolia may be an example of how the situation may change for the better in this respect.
It is a very important Asian country, which the European Union may in future point to as an example for other Central Asian countries.
<D>
Mr President, again today many talk grandly about European values of democracy.
Today we will have a pretentious affirmation of a belief in human rights yet, at the same time, the EU elite are preparing to celebrate their greatest stroke of arrogance to date as they make ready to sign the repackaged Constitution without a backward glance towards their people and what they want or what they think.
The 2005 referendums showed Europe to be out of touch, but the lesson learned was not to abandon what the people did not want but to circumvent their opposition by determining this time not to ask them.
Hence the scandal that, across this continent, national powers will be stripped away, superstate structures will be established, a new EU citizenship will be created, legal personality will be bestowed on the EU and only a handful of citizens will ever be asked.
Why?
Because in most states, my own included, the leaders fear the verdict of their people, adding cowardice to their arrogance.
So on a day when there is much talk of human rights, I say: Give the people of Europe the basic political and human right to say 'yes' or 'no' to this Constitution, the right to say 'yes' or 'no' in a referendum.
(Applause)
<D>
The Green Paper on the common fisheries policy tears to shreds both the European Commission and the Member States.
It is emphatic proof that not all projects and reforms carried out within the Union are successful.
We should, therefore, draw the right conclusions with regard to both institutional and practical solutions.
One of the fundamental mistakes of the 2002 reform was excessive centralisation.
The diversity and specific nature of different regions of the European Union should oblige us to regionalise.
The European Commission must not treat the Baltic Sea on a par with the Atlantic or the Mediterranean Sea.
Regionalisation of fisheries policy should go hand in hand with specific measures relating to social and economic matters.
From the point of view of the people who live in areas which are dependent on fishing, the most important course of action is economic and social diversification and restructuring, including the creation of new jobs outwith the fishing sector.
The fact that it is not possible to increase catches and employment in the Baltic fishing sector should lead to the above measures being put into effect.
This is something which meets social expectations and needs.
Research shows that two-thirds of European fish stocks are under threat, including very well-known species such as sole, plaice and cod.
Analyses carried out by the WWF say openly that if specific changes are not introduced, the breeding population of Mediterranean tuna and many other species will disappear by 2012.
<D>
There is a country in the European Union where, for nearly 20 years, the human rights and fundamental freedoms of about 20% of the population have been violated.
Regardless of this fact, Latvia was accepted into the European Union in 2004.
At the time that Latvia's accession negotiations were taking place, the Latvian Government promised the then EU Enlargement Commissioner, Günther Verheugen, to solve the non-citizen problem, but to this day, regardless of those promises, the question has not been resolved.
As a result, there are approximately 340 000 non-citizens living in EU territory.
In Latvia, they are second-class people, who are not allowed to work in the public sector, or hold official posts even in districts where more than 60% of the population are non-citizens.
There is a city in Latvia, Daugavpils, where more than 90% of the population is Russian-speaking.
Despite this fact, the use of Russian as an official language in the city is forbidden, and 30% of the population do not have the vote in local elections.
Local councillors, elected in a Russian-speaking city, are not allowed to use their mother tongue in meetings.
Funny though it may be, to this very day, the European Commission has found neither the necessary arguments nor the time to influence the Latvian Government to bring to an end discrimination on grounds of language.
It is essential to set up a working group to investigate the situation in Latvia without delay, otherwise I do not see the point of the EU's being a party to the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.
We must make it known clearly and unambiguously that there is a country within the European Union where the rights of more than 25% of the population have been cynically violated over many years.
<D>
(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report by our fellow Member Mrs Harkin on volunteering is a way for the European Parliament to demonstrate its social aspect to European citizens.
The report promotes the idea of contribution, which is dealt with comprehensively and objectively on both a theoretical and practical level.
Our fellow Member's work is important; I welcome it and congratulate her warmly.
We in turn have also tried to contribute to her activity.
We have among other things brought out the importance of corporate volunteering, the coordination of voluntary initiatives reconciling family with professional life, as well as the creation of rapid action volunteer sections in every region to deal speedily with natural disasters and accidents.
In general terms, volunteering helps among other things to increase GDP.
As has been said, volunteering boosts skill acquisition and improves employability of a volunteer.
It provides socially and educationally excluded persons and the unemployed with genuine opportunities and encourages immigrants to participate in the local community.
The actions and the activity of volunteers speak for themselves.
In my country, Greece, for example, the 2004 Olympic volunteers won us our most significant medal.
Both individual and group volunteering are vital in social, economic, environmental and cultural terms.
They unify all differences and peculiarities, while promoting them and revealing them in a spirit of concord and common aims.
I congratulate the rapporteur once more.
I call on you to support Mrs Harkin's report and to join us in signing the joint written declaration that we have drawn up with other Members, asking that 2011 should be declared the European Year of Volunteering.
<D>
I would like to thank the rapporteur for the extensive effort he has made in preparing this very complex technical document, as statistical matters are usually of little interest to the general public and hold little attraction for them.
That is why the discussion on this issue is taking place rather late.
I am very pleased that Mr Frattini is present, although statistical matters usually fall within Mr Almunia's sphere of competence.
However, we are talking about large databases, the use, security and management of which must be clearly defined.
I believe that Mr Almunia is well aware of all the problems we are experiencing with different databases, their use, security and the possibility of their being used for the wrong purpose.
The document recognises a number of points that would help to avoid similar problems.
There is one more thing that delights me: the document will bring about increased transparency in government administrative functions.
To my mind, this is very important; this sort of information should be accessible to the general public.
On the other hand, as a representative of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I cannot help worrying that we have recently been discussing a large number of documents relating to obtaining statistical data and including various activities in different registers.
Less and less thought is given to profit, the ratio between the profit and the cost of data collection.
As an economist, I do understand the importance of this data for defining economic policy, decision making - even in view of security it is important to be aware of the different aspects of multinational companies' activities within the EU, within the Member States.
As a representative of Lithuania, a border country, an EU border country, I understand it only too well.
Nevertheless, at the beginning of my tenure much has been said regarding the necessity of analysing how much it costs the trade and of making the relevant calculations.
Some Member States were prepared to do this.
For example, the Netherlands have actually done so.
Regretfully, this initiative has fizzled out.
I can only regret the fact that in this case the possibility of ascertaining the burden on business and the alleviation of this burden was not considered.
Various small European selection groups could have been developed and considered to be examples, while analysing the statistical basis for the whole of Europe.
<D>
President-in-Office. - (SL) Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is following with anguish the development of the situation in Tibet and the neighbouring provinces in China which have a sizeable Tibetan population, such as Tsinghai, Szechwan and Kansu.
European Union representatives have been in frequent contact with Chinese representatives ever since the start of the disturbances in Tibet.
In response to the request by the European Union, their Chinese counterparts gave the EU troika the first report on the events in the Tibetan capital, Lhasa, on 15 March.
The situation in Tibet was also discussed at the meeting of European Union representatives with the Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister on 17 March.
Both sides agreed at that meeting that dialogue about the events in Tibet must be continuous and open.
Following the incident at the Chinese Embassy in Brussels, European Union representatives were invited for talks with the same official on 19 March.
Because of numerous protests in Europe relating to the events in Tibet, this official demanded an apology and compensation in the event of damage to Chinese Embassies.
At the beginning of last week, on 17 March, the Presidency expressed its deep concern in the light of numerous reports about the disturbances in Tibet.
It expressed its deepest sympathies to victims' families and stressed that it would like to receive from the Chinese government urgent clarification of the situation in Tibet.
The Presidency advised all parties to act with restraint.
It called on the Chinese government to renounce the use of force against the protesters and to respond to the protests in accordance with internationally adopted democratic principles.
At the same time the Presidency called on the protesters to renounce violence.
It emphasised the importance it gave to the right to free expression and peaceful protest.
As we know, the European Union supports the territorial integrity of China, but it strives for peaceful reconciliation between the Chinese authorities and the Tibetan religious leader, the Dalai Lama, and his representatives.
That is why our statement calls on the Chinese government to respond to the concerns of the Tibetans in respect of the human rights.
The European Union is encouraging both parties to enter into constructive dialogue.
This could be the foundation for a permanent solution which would be acceptable to all and would respect Tibetan culture, religion and identity.
In addition to the previously mentioned statement by the Presidency, the European Union called on the Chinese government to allow independent international media access to Tibet.
This is an issue that you yourself mentioned, Mr President.
The Chinese have so far rejected the suggestion, saying that media access would be allowed as soon as the situation in Tibet became safe.
The international community is still unable to obtain reliable information on the numbers of casualties among the Tibetan protesters.
During the latest discussions, the Chinese authorities hinted to the Slovenian Presidency that, in the next few days, it would allow a group of European journalists access to Tibet and freedom to report.
The Presidency hopes that this will come to fruition.
I would also like to stress that we have asked the Chinese authorities for clarification on the future fate of those protesters who had not reported to the authorities by the end of last week.
They answered that all those who violated Chinese laws would be prosecuted according to current legislation.
The European Union expressed concern that further detention of protesters who had peacefully expressed their will might cause renewed tension between the Tibetans and the Han, that is to say the Chinese community in Tibet.
At the same time the EU would like to stress that national security legislation should not be applied in order to restrict human rights.
Mr President, you also mentioned the question of the Olympic Games in China.
I must emphasise that, at last week's informal ministerial meeting in Slovenia, the European Union Ministers for Sport, together with the Presidents of the national Olympic committees of all the Member States, the countries of the Western Balkans and Norway, unanimously adopted a declaration in which they stressed the importance of the Olympic movement and its values in promoting and supporting human rights.
At the same time they spoke out against a boycott of the Olympic Games.
They did not discuss participation in the opening ceremony.
The Presidency is of the opinion that a boycott of the Games or other sporting events in the year of intercultural dialogue would not be an appropriate response to unresolved political questions.
It could also mean a lost opportunity to promote respect for human rights.
May I also say that the session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva was marked by concerns about the situation in Tibet.
In the debate on the Vienna Declaration and the Action Plan, the European Union invited both sides to avoid the use of force and to respect internationally approved standards of human rights.
Dialogue between the European Union and China has been continuing this week.
In yesterday's telephone conversation, the President of the EU General Affairs and External Relations Council, the Slovenian Foreign Minister, Dr Rupel, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Peoples' Republic of China, Mr Yang Jeichi, discussed among other topics the situation of the Tibetan community.
Dr Rupel reiterated to Mr Yang the European Union's hope that the Chinese authorities and the Dalai Lama or his representatives would begin dialogue as soon as possible.
At the same time he called on the Chinese authorities urgently to release protesters who had peacefully expressed their opinions.

Vice-President of the Commission. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is looking very carefully at the worsening security situation in eastern Chad and is emphatic in its support for the deployment of EUFOR troops in full strength to protect refugees and displaced persons in the region.
The European Union will use every instrument at its disposal in eastern Chad to do this.
The Commission will provide not only EUFOR troops, but also more than EUR 50 million as part of a comprehensive plan.
With these funds, measures will be financed in the following three key areas, which extend from emergency aid to long-term development aid.
The first sector concerns humanitarian aid, for which ECHO has already provided EUR 30.5 million in 2007 in the form of emergency aid measures for supporting refugees and displaced persons in different sectors in Chad.
A similar level of funding has also been set aside to continue these measures in 2008.
The second sector comprises the organisation of a Chadian police force, which will be responsible for carrying out humanitarian protection measures.
In the context of the EU and UN missions in Chad, the United Nations are setting up, training and equipping up to 850 Chadian police forces and constabularies, which are to be deployed in refugee camps in eastern Chad.
The European Union is supporting this UN programme with EUR 10 million from the Instrument for Stability.
The third sector concerns reintegration and rehabilitation.
In 2008 the Commission will be providing EUR 10.1 million from the ninth European Development Fund for development measures promoting reconstruction, conflict resolution and the organisation of administrative capacities.
These are measures that are necessary for improving the security situation in the areas of the UN-EU mission.
Further measures are planned as part of the 10th European Development Fund, for which EUR 311 million are estimated from 2008 to 2013.
Returning displaced persons to their home country should be supported in the short term with these measures.
Their aim in the long-term is to stabilise the situation permanently in Chad and throughout the region.
The previous speakers have rightly referred to the flare-up in the battles between government-friendly rebels and President Idriss Déby's troops in eastern Chad, which has clearly made humanitarian aid more difficult.
Even in the areas around the refugee camps, safety can no longer be guaranteed.
In addition, the precarious humanitarian situation is coming increasingly to a head owing to the rapid increase in the number of refugees from the combat zones.
In this deeply worrying situation, the restoration of security in the region is a task of the utmost urgency.
In order to cope with this task, a military presence is vital.
EUFOR troops should therefore be deployed specifically in these crisis areas.
They will, however, be successful only if the causes of the conflict are eliminated and if a political process is introduced at the same time, with the aim of calming the underlying tensions and reducing poverty by facilitating economic development.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking everybody not only for supporting the proposal in the report but also, and even more, for supporting the SMEs.
SMEs are a vital part of the European economy and here, as I have already said, in the Eurostars programme we are talking about SMEs which will be the 'stars' of the future.
This is an innovative approach.
It is not easy to implement approaches where we combine money from the Member States with Community funding, but it is definitely worthwhile, because that is exactly the direction in which we should go in the future.
We are joining the best of EUREKA - flexibility, simplicity, decentralised approach, market orientation - with the best of the Framework Programme: centralised management, common evaluation and common selection.
I can assure you that also in the other parts of the Framework Programme we are keeping our eyes very much open for the benefit of the SMEs.
Simplification is the name of the game, so we have introduced, as you are probably aware, a higher funding rate for SMEs than for the rest.
So they have a 75% co-funding rate in the Framework Programme, while the rest of the bigger companies have 50%, which means that we are stimulating their participation.
We have introduced a guarantee fund, which very much simplifies their participation in the Framework Programme, because the fact that they have to submit some bank guarantees in advance was one of the major problems for SMEs; and we are also about to introduce a 'unique registration facility' which will again ease the job because you will have to apply only once and all your data will be stored and the next time you apply this will be done automatically.
Therefore, if we look at the results of the first year - and as you know, we agreed about the target of 15% funding which should go to SMEs from the cooperation part of the programme - we can say that it is working.
While in Framework Programme 6 we were not achieving the target, from the first evaluations and first insight into the results, we can see that this figure is closer to 20% than 15%, which is a major step forward.
We are also working in the Commission.
I have just come from a meeting of the competitiveness group where we discussed the Small Business Act - that is the working title - where we want to address all the issues connected with SMEs in an organised way.
I would also like to mention that, although today we are deciding about financial participation from the Community side, in fact this has already begun, and more than 200 have applied for the first call, which is an important success.
Finally, I should like to mention that I am extremely glad that Luxembourg has decided to join.
There is definitely no problem in substance.
We should all do our best to make its accession to the programme as quick as possible.
<D>
in writing. - (FR) After five years of discussions, European consumers will soon have identical information about consumer credit, enabling them to make better comparisons with foreign offers when buying a car, a dishwasher or a sofa bed.
Although Europeans already have the ability to take out bank loans abroad to buy consumer goods, few use it: less than 1% of the total amount of this type of credit is currently borrowed abroad.
However, rates currently vary by up to 100% (Portugal 12%, Finland 6%)!
The major obstacles identified are the language barrier, distance and the lack of consumer confidence.
The directive, which I support, should help to increase this confidence, keep consumers better informed and facilitate their choices, while enabling them to benefit from uniform rules of protection (early repayment, right of withdrawal, etc.).
Two questions, to conclude:
Are we not in danger of encouraging people to take on too much debt if we do not further strengthen the conditions for lenders to check consumers' creditworthiness?
Do we not urgently need to open the way for cross-border competition in property loans?
<D>
(FR) Mr President, I must first of all congratulate the French Presidency on this achievement.
I believe that we have come a long way from Europe's position on Iraq to its current attitude towards the crisis in the Caucasus.
Congratulations.
Thanks to its Presidency, the Union has been more effective and quicker off the mark than Washington.
All this is positive, but questions do remain: firstly, how can we minimise the suffering of the population; secondly, how can we ensure that the Russians respect the rules and what strategy do we adopt, in the longer term, with regard to Russia?
I greet the measures and the text by the Council with moderate optimism and satisfaction.
It contains all the main elements of condemnation and action, including the more generous offer in terms of Community assistance and a potential ESDP mission.
But I would say to the presidency that it is just an hors d'oeuvre.
(FR) It is just an hors d'œuvre or an entrée.
We are waiting for the main course which will be peace and stability in the region, and the European Union's long-term strategy in this region of the Caucasus.
We need to deploy all efforts to make Russia understand that it has the choice: either to cooperate with the EU as a responsible partner assuming its obligations and commitments and fully respecting the six-point Sarkozy plan, or to expose itself to the condemnation of the international community, which may evolve into ostracism, and eventually into isolation encompassing a set of appropriate measures to be taken if the need arises.
We, the Union, also have a choice - either to be satisfied with our verbal actions and avoid measures which Russia would understand, or to revise, if necessary, our policy towards Russia, making clear that we can be both assertive and respectful in the event of non-compliance by Russia with the rules which we expect...
(The President cut off the speaker.)
<D>
Mr President, I wish that a group of farmers who I spoke to this afternoon from the North West of Ireland were here to listen to this debate because they might even want to contribute.
Let us be honest: no one wants their financial affairs made public, and I think there are Members of this House who are talking about openness and transparency who would run a mile from it themselves.
I liked the point made by someone else this evening that it may be right that we publish the payments of everyone who gets money from the public purse.
Having said that, I believe we are going to have publication of payments and I believe generally in this term 'openness and transparency', but it is a two-way street.
I also would question the notion that information is equal to understanding and it is because of that question that I think you do need to have clarification about what the payments actually mean.
The group of farmers I met today were in beef and sheep farming, and many of them were using their single farm payment to subsidise their production.
Perhaps they are silly to do that.
Maybe they should stop farming and let the farms go to rack and ruin and continue to accept the cheque.
Some comments have been made here about the failure of policy as though it were farmers' fault.
But I think it is the policymakers of Europe who should take the rap for the failures that have been identified.
Those who talk about intervention and export refunds must have forgotten about the 2003 reforms.
We now have a problem of shortages within the European Union.
We import beef.
Global demand is rising for dairy products, and grain is in short supply so we have moved on a great deal.
Yes, publish, but explain.
Protect people and make sure that they are not ridiculed wrongly for the payments they receive.
Do not use this as a weapon to beat farmers with.
The Commission are doing it already in the health check, where they have talked about how, now that publication will be made, we could look at cutting back on payments.
Perhaps we need to do that at the higher level, but let us be honest in how we debate this topic.
I think we do need to review the use that the information is put to.
<D>
in writing. - (FR) I voted against this report, which encourages the Member States to take the necessary measures towards 'good environmental status' in marine affairs by 2020.
The marine environment hosts vital resources and its ecosystem provides essential services such as climate regulation and oxygen production.
Policies concerning maritime transport, fishing, energy or even tourism have evolved separately, occasionally leading to failures, inconsistencies or usage conflicts.
A more global approach was necessary, taking account of all aspects of a sustainable development policy for Europe's marine environment.
The Member States must devise strategies for the marine environment in a number of stages for waters falling under their sovereignty.
By 2015 these strategies ought to produce a programme of measures designed to achieve good environmental status.
Member States sharing the same marine region or sub-region will have to cooperate to coordinate the various components of marine environment strategy.
Work must continue with the creation of marine parks, as highlighted by the Grenelle Environmental Forum.
The report provides for the creation of protected areas, but it could have been more restrictive.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, it is a sign of the importance that this House attaches to our strategic relationship with China that this debate has been scheduled during your inaugural session.
I yet again welcome the opportunity to contribute with a brief outline of the perspective of the Commission on behalf of my colleague Benita Ferrero-Waldner, who, I have indicated, is unfortunately travelling this week and cannot be here.
I do not need to remind this House of the huge progress we have made in relations with China since our first summit, now 10 years ago.
Economic and trade relations have been transformed, people-to-people contacts are multiplying and we are engaged in dialogue on an ever-increasing range of issues.
Following the last EU-China Summit in May, negotiations on a new partnership and cooperation agreement are proceeding well and we are able to take advantage of a growing number of high-level contacts, including Prime Minister Wen's highly successful visit to President Barroso earlier this year and the meeting of the high-level economic and trade dialogue which I co-chaired with Vice-Premier Wang Qishan.
Today we are naturally focused on global challenges, including the economic and financial crisis and climate change, as well as regional issues.
At the same time, we have strong interests in the situation inside China, where we witness many spectacular achievements but also developments that cause concern.
China's policy of opening up its economy has lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty and helped the world progress towards the important Millennium Development Goals.
Yet China is a huge country with considerable internal challenges and differences between its regions.
The strength of our strategic partnership also allows for constructive and open exchange of views on issues where Europe and China diverge.
This can be on aspects of our trade relationship or human rights - for example over Tibet, which I know is of particular interest in this House.
Recently we expressed strong concern over the unrest in Xinjiang, deplored the loss of life, and expressed our condolences and sympathy to the families of the victims.
We have called on all parties to show restraint and bring an immediate end to all acts of violence.
We hope the situation can be resolved peacefully through dialogue without further bloodshed.
The EU has tried, over the years, to convey to the Chinese authorities its worries over the situation of ethnic minorities in China and to share its own experience, many times painful, on how to address the causes of marginalisation, exclusion and discrimination that those minorities often face.
We all share the goal of a more open, transparent China adhering to international standards on human rights and working together to address global challenges.
To achieve this, we must continue to integrate China deeper into the international community and work on the development of our strategic partnership in the spirit of constructive engagement.
<D>
Mr President, the PPE-DE Group has decided to vote in favour of the Lipietz report on trade and climate change at this mini-plenary session.
The report has merit and addresses many of the concerns we all share.
However, we have decided to vote against some of the amendments to paragraphs, because we believe that global warming must be addressed through sustainable measures which do not have an adverse effect on economic growth or the long-term prospects of Europe's social model.
As a political group, we are very sensitive to the issue of climate change.
The European Union has taken the lead in proposing far-reaching solutions on how to tackle climate change.
We believe that Europe's proposals have become the benchmark for any future discussion, and that they are compatible with our economic model.
We believe that global trade has been beneficial to the world economy, but at the same time we acknowledge that more needs to be done, especially in the transport sector, to reduce harmful emissions.
However, world trade as such should not be distorted.
Written explanations of vote
<D>
in writing. - (LT) Cities stimulate economic growth and entrepreneurship, and contribute to the creation of new sustainable jobs.
By implementing the Urban Agenda, we must focus more on serving the development and qualitative upgrading of the infrastructure and services in European cities.
In order to implement the concept of smarter urban development, conditions must be created for cities to develop their infrastructure properly and effectively by means of advanced technologies, in particular information and communications technology (ICT).
The application of intelligent systems would help address challenges related to transport congestion, energy efficiency and safety in the public sector.
Given the specific needs of individual regions, it is necessary to promote investment in technological progress.
We must promote social innovation in urban areas, particularly in disadvantaged neighbourhoods, by exploiting the opportunities offered by cohesion policy.
It is crucial to regenerate urban areas by reclaiming industrial sites and contaminated land, while promoting inclusive development of urban and rural areas.
To achieve this objective it is necessary to implement multi-level governance, regional planning and the partnership principle.
It should be noted that based on the best practice of Member States regarding strategic planning, the Commission should draw up specific EU guidelines for integrated urban development planning practice and make integrated urban planning legally binding.
Moreover, local government initiatives must actively pursue partnership between the public and private sectors and implement innovative strategies for the development of urban infrastructure.
<D>
in writing. - Energy costs are growing at an alarming rate, contributing to a substantial increase in energy-related poverty across the EU.
However, the market price of energy is only one side of the problem.
There is a significant, additional financial burden on consumers due to energy market inefficiencies and distortions.
For example, in Malta consumers and businesses saw an exorbitant increase in their energy bills when the price of oil was at its high, but there was no decrease even when the price of oil dropped more than half.
What we need is an EU-wide policy to protect consumers and SMEs from pricing malpractices carried out by public utility companies.
One solution may be a national independent regulator which would create the necessary checks and balances against any abusive or non transparent conduct by private traders and/or government owned entities in respect of any price increases on public utilities like gas, electricity, water, airport charges and others.
This should be implemented through improving the existing E.U. legislation and directives involving consumer protection especially to ensure:
Better standard of transparency and rationality governing price increases as well as better access and information regarding consumer rights.
Less costs and less bureaucracy for the consumer who has a genuine case in order to seek redress.
<D>
rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen - I hope that the Council Presidency is going to join us - it has now been more than six years since the adoption of the Directive on temporary work was postponed, not because of Parliament, which gave its opinion as soon as the Commission's proposal was referred to it in 2002, but precisely because of the deadlock of certain Member States within the Council.
We have the opportunity today, after the adoption of a common position between the Member States, to arrive at this important piece of social legislation at a time when expectations of a social Europe are high, and it is this opportunity that we must seize.
Temporary work accounts for more than three million jobs in the Union.
Temporary workers are employed by around 20 000 companies, which represent a turnover of EUR 75 billion.
This is a sector that is obviously very liable to fluctuations in growth, and temporary workers are today the first to be affected by the economic slowdown and the rise in unemployment.
However, like other types of insecure and atypical employment, temporary work has seen structural growth over the last few years, and this development was estimated at almost 60% over the last five years.
It is a development that has continued with particular intensity within the new Member States.
Temporary work concerns a very large number of sectors that vary according to the Member State: industry, in some countries, services, in others, and construction, agriculture and transport, in others still.
Its proportion also varies a great deal from one country to another.
It may be as much as 5% of all workers in countries such as the United Kingdom.
The duration of assignments also varies.
In some countries it is short, with assignments lasting around 10 days, in France, for example; less than a week, in Spain; or around 20 days in Finland.
However, in other countries, such as Ireland, Belgium and the Netherlands, it may be several months, indeed even a year or more in Austria.
Temporary workers, as we know, are more exposed to physical risks, intensity of work and accidents at work.
Their training is often less extensive.
Stress linked to the insecurity of their jobs is also extremely common.
The fact is, the laws and the types of legal framework relating to their situation differ greatly within the Member States - so much so that temporary workers are, for example, truly protected by equal treatment, in particular in terms of pay, in just 10 of the 27 countries of the European Union.
Their access to training, social protection, maternity leave - these subjects all vary and are absolutely not guaranteed in the same way in all the Member States.
That is why the European Commission, at the request of the social partners, and with the support of the European Parliament, wanted a piece of legislation that could guarantee such equal treatment.
Having received an initial draft, in November 2002 the European Parliament, following on from the report by my fellow Member, Mrs van den Burg, who is still here in this House and to whom I should like to pay tribute, strengthened this draft legislation by making it possible to guarantee equal treatment from day one, in particular regarding pay.
When its common position was adopted last June, the Council eventually came round to the European Parliament's position.
It therefore believed that equal treatment from day one should be the general rule and that any derogation from this principle needed to be agreed on by the social partners by means of collective negotiations or through agreements concluded with the social partners at national level.
The European Parliament's amendments on the definition of the basic working and employment conditions, in particular with the inclusion of pay in Article 3, have also been incorporated in the common position.
Lastly, the Council's common position has retained the amendments on access to employment, collective facilities and vocational training, and on the right of temporary workers to be represented under the same conditions as those of permanent workers employed by the user enterprise.
A debate has taken place within the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs concerning Parliament's initial proposal to amend the Commission's proposal to add elements relating to health, safety and hygiene at work, which have not been adopted by the Council.
However, these guarantees exist under the terms of another directive, the Council Directive of 25 June 1991, which supplements the measures to encourage improvements in the health and safety at work of workers with a fixed-duration employment relationship or a temporary employment relationship.
As you know, ladies and gentlemen - I am going to end this first speech on this point - the European Trade Union Confederation, on the one hand, and the professional bodies representing temporary employment agencies, on the other, want us to adopt this legislation.
Adopting this legislation today means ensuring that the European Parliament's positions at first reading henceforth become the law; that this framework for protecting temporary workers can be transposed within the next three years; and that the Pandora's box of uncertain negotiations within the Council cannot be reopened.
That is why the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs decided on 7 October to recommend the adoption of the common position, without amendment, in order to protect this, the most insecure employment sector in Europe.
<D>
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, to the many thank-yous we have heard I should like to add a very special one of my own.
I was responsible for the framework directive in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, and it is thanks to the political instincts of Catherine Trautmann in media matters and her ability to work in a very structured and systematic manner that we in Parliament have perhaps been able to prevent the pursuit of a misguided media policy through the report on the framework directive.
We shall see.
Commissioner, in my view, Parliament has made crucial changes to the draft framework directive as regards competition law but also, and more especially, on frequency-trading.
I found that your initial proposals for the framework directive were purely market-focused and vastly overestimated the digital dividend.
Thankfully, these proposals did not appeal to the members of the Committee on Culture and Education or, subsequently, to the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy.
On the contrary, my fellow Members put public cultural and political interests and the general public good at the heart of their deliberations, and I believe this is reflected most clearly in the following elements of the Trautmann report:
Radio frequencies are defined as a public good and will also remain the responsibility of the Member States.
Priority will be given to broadcasting in particular but also to opinion-forming services.
Your attempt to force broadcasting onto the defensive has failed, Commissioner.
It will be easier to introduce pan-European services - that is a good thing, as I am sure you will agree.
The Member States will also have primary responsibility for further harmonisation of frequencies.
If there are difficulties, decisions will not be taken by the Commission alone - Parliament will also be involved.
BERT will play a major role.
It goes without saying, as far as I am concerned, that its funding must be European.
I hope we shall manage to ensure that it is.
Besides the framework directive and the point about frequencies, I would also like to say something about two other reports, beginning with the Harbour report.
In your report, Mr Harbour, there really are some very good provisions for consumers and consumer interests.
Greater consideration will be given in future to the interests of people with disabilities, for example.
I also believe that you even contribute to media pluralism through your proposed rules on mandatory services.
My group does not agree, however, with the attempt that is made in the report to regulate copyright too.
We do not like that at all.
Neither the French model - and this is addressed to the Council Presidency too - nor the 'three strikes' model has our support - on the contrary.
This attempt does not allay any of our concerns about copyright or about the protection of privacy on the Internet.
Let me conclude with a few words on the Alvaro report.
You have spoken with great conviction once again, Mr Alvaro, about data privacy.
I find, as you have suggested in your speeches, that there is no consistent line yet on matters such as the protection of IP addresses.
Our experience of the telecoms scandal and the trade in addresses through call centres has shown that IP addresses must be given maximum protection, and I hope that we shall reach agreement to that effect within the next fortnight.
<D>
in writing. - I voted for this report but there are still many areas of concern that Parliament has chosen not to address, notably to make the sector more competitive against third country imports, and to improve the quality of wine produced at EU level.
Sadly national and regional priorities have got in the way of a lasting reform programme.
In Europe we must protect our quality wine, and we must also address the issue of producing quality wines at an affordable price.
There is no doubt the Commission's proposals have been watered down.
Thankfully, however, my amendment to lift the de minimis criteria, and those amendments to allow chaptalisation have been accepted by Parliament.
These amendments are crucial for northern countries and my own wine producers in the United Kingdom.
The European wine industry still faces many threats, and in the EU we are seeing our own market share disappearing to New World countries.
But why?
It is because they can produce excellent-quality wine at an affordable price and with a marketing strategy that is based on what the consumer wants in the 21st century; not what the Romans planted in the third.
We need quality, not quantity, and we need to produce wine that offers value for money.
<D>
(DE) Madam President, please forgive me for demanding your attention so often.
Unfortunately, this was not my week with the catch-the-eye procedure.
I kept missing out.
There were a couple of things I wanted to say about this point too, however I am happy overall that we have passed this directive.
I also voted in favour.
I am also pleased that we have been able to strengthen consumer rights and have included so-called door-to-door selling, because a lot of shady practices are to be found there.
However I would once again ask that we should remember the problem of bureaucracy when implementing this law.
In Germany we have a particularly large number of small and medium-sized businesses.
Although these businesses are not involved in door-to-door selling, they naturally make frequent deals with customers that are concluded with a handshake.
This has been the practice for hundreds of years.
We need to take care that we do not overburden these SMEs with excessive bureaucracy.
To restate the point, I am happy and voted in favour of the directive.
<D>
Madam President, Mr Posselt, as you know, the Berlin-Palermo rail axis is one of the 30 priority transEuropean transport network projects and the Brenner base tunnel project is the centrepiece of this priority project.
The Commission supports this key element of the priority project that will make it possible to connect rail networks at both sides of the Alps by means of a highcapacity, high-speed line, mainly designed for goods transport.
The project will therefore contribute both to the effective operation of the internal market and environmental targets and to economic recovery.
The Commission therefore wishes to meet citizens' expectations in practice.
This is another reason why we accelerated the granting of finance at the end of last year once authorisation had been given for EUR 786 million of funding for priority project No 1.
The coordinator Mrs van Miert has been monitoring the project since 2005, I believe with positive results.
We have currently started a consultation process with the EU Member States in order to renew the mandate of the European coordinators and thus cover the period 2009-2013.
In this way, we will be able to allow them to carry on with their work, particularly that of monitoring the priority projects.
On 22 March 2009, the Austrian authorities submitted their multiannual programme for infrastructures, which includes financing of the Brenner base tunnel.
On 17 April 2009, following the completion of the environmental impact assessment, they issued a construction permit for the project.
The Italian authorities, for their part, submitted their base tunnel project to their Inter-ministerial Economic Programming Committee (CIPE) so that the funding could be approved in May.
Minister Matteoli, with whom I have spoken, confirms the will of the Italian state to pursue the objective, in other words to finance the project, and I believe that the Austrian and Italian authorities are in absolute agreement on this matter.
Priority project 17 - the Strasbourg-Vienna high-speed link that forms part of the Paris-Strasbourg-Stuttgart-Vienna-Bratislava rail axis - is proceeding in a satisfactory manner in all the Member States involved: France, Germany, Austria and Slovakia.
Most of the 831 km stretch between Strasbourg and Vienna - more specifically the Strasbourg-Stuttgart and Linz-Vienna sections - will be complete by 2015.
The Stuttgart-Ulm section, which represents the most significant bottleneck, will be complete by 2020.
The relevant finance protocol will be signed on 2 April of this year.
At the moment, the most complicated section seems to be the cross-border section in Bavaria between Munich and Salzburg.
The German Government is currently conducting a review of its multiannual programming, and so we will have to wait until the end of this year before we can begin discussing this very important section.
The Strasbourg-Vienna section will cost EUR 10 billion and the priority project will cost EUR 13.5 billion in total.
I believe that this information may be of use and covers all of the requests made in Mr Posselt's question.
<D>
Colleagues, I have a short speech, as I promised you one year ago.
We are at the mid-way point of my Presidency.
At the very beginning, I promised that I would inform you of my activities.
As the President of the European Parliament, I represent all of you.
Wherever I go, whatever I do, I have always felt the honour and responsibility of acting on behalf of this prestigious Chamber.
But this speech is not about me: this speech is about you and about your activity.
It is about all of us, what we have achieved together at the European Parliament in the last 15 months, and what is ahead of us.
<D>
rapporteur. - (FR) Madam President, nothing surprises me, and in particular nothing surprised me in the Commissioner's communication.
Commissioner, thank you for that very detailed exposé.
I would simply like to recall here that the declared objective of the Council's proposal for a regulation is to simplify and improve the procedures for managing fishing authorisations.
It was a question of introducing general provisions applicable to all authorisation applications, as you yourself said, Commissioner.
A single procedure for managing all fishing authorisations has been proposed.
The sharing of responsibilities between the Commission and the Member States is defined.
New eligibility criteria, penalties in the event of infringements and provisions regarding reporting are also proposed.
Compliance with the international regulations laid down by the different agreements is strengthened by the introduction of measures requiring Member States to exclude vessels from fishing if they are found to be involved in a serious infringement or if they have been placed on a list for taking part in illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.
Mrs Stihler had been designated for this report but because the majority of members of the Committee on Fisheries did not agree with her on two points she considered key, she preferred to remove her name from the report.
It therefore falls to me to present this draft as Committee chairman.
However, I would like, in passing, to thank her for her work and I will leave it to her, when she presents her amendments, to give us the reasons for her decision.
Within the framework of the consultation procedure, in her report which is now mine, the Committee on Fisheries has proposed a number of amendments to the Council's proposal for a regulation, and you gave an exhaustive list of these - not a list but the numbers, Commissioner.
These were adopted by a large majority of 19 votes for, 5 against and 2 abstentions.
I will only present the main ones here.
Firstly, the regulation should not apply to overseas territories of EU Member States.
Secondly, an infringement should not be considered to be serious unless it has been confirmed by a successful prosecution in accordance with the relevant national legislation.
Thirdly, the IUU list should be understood to mean the list of fishing vessels identified in the framework of a RFMO or by the Commission under the Council Regulation establishing a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing - that very important task, Commissioner, which you are personally rather keen on.
Fourthly, the Commission shall not refuse to transmit applications to the authorising authority without having given the Member States the opportunity to submit their observations.
Fifthly, the Commission may not refuse to pass on applications unless it comes to the Commission's knowledge, on the basis of duly substantiated facts, that a Member State has not complied with its obligations under a particular agreement.
Sixthly and finally, Community fishing vessels for which a fishing authorisation has been issued shall transmit to their competent national authority the data concerning their catches and fishing effort with a frequency appropriate to the agreement and fishery concerned.
The transmission requirements shall be compatible with those contained in the e-logbook regulation.
I will leave it to my colleagues to talk more about some of these amendments, because some of them are the authors.
<D>
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, we are at the half-way point in this Action Plan, and it is time for a review.
We are taking stock of what has been done up to now, and the question we must ask ourselves is this: have there been any visible results?
The Commission is sitting back and saying that it is satisfied.
However, if the air we breathe and the water we drink are making us ill, it is high time for Europe to take action and become the driving force for a new overall approach to such health risks.
That is why the Action Plan cannot be regarded as simply an add-on to existing EU policy; it must set new benchmarks.
I welcome the fact that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has adopted a highly critical position towards the Action Plan and has demanded major improvements.
We are firmly convinced that the Action Plan is doomed to failure unless it is based on a pro-active policy of prevention, and one thing must be clear: without clear-cut quantitative goals, it will remain a paper tiger.
We are pleased that the environmental report bears a green handprint, especially when it comes to nanotechnology.
It is clear that the potential new risks have not been taken into adequate account in the Action Plan.
Indeed, it is scandalous that when it comes to the risks associated with nanotechnology, the European Commission is still burying its head in the sand and is claiming that the current legislation in place is quite adequate.
We know that the very opposite is true.
Nanotechnology is being allowed to develop in what is in effect a legal vacuum.
Then there is the issue of electrosmog: we know that electromagnetic radiation poses a major and increasing problem, so it is quite unacceptable for us, as the European Parliament, to water down limit values which are already set much too high.
Yet another issue is indoor air quality: the EU has set milestones when it comes to protection against fine particles, but what about indoor air quality, given that we spend most of our time in closed rooms?
The Commission cannot continue to ignore this issue.
We call on the Commission to bring forward clear legislative proposals to improve air quality in all the relevant areas: construction projects, glues used in furniture, etc.
Achieving better protection for particularly vulnerable groups such as children and pregnant women is also a matter which is very close to our hearts, and the precautionary principle should be the guiding principle for our legislation in all these areas.
Naturally, we would have liked to achieve more, but we hope that the Commission will not stop at that.
This area of work must not be allowed to come to a standstill, and we believe that we can take this issue forward.

(FR) Madam President, as already stated, the European Union has been negotiating the conclusion of a free trade agreement with the Gulf Cooperation Council for nearly 20 years.
Since then the Commission's negotiating mandate has barely changed and has certainly not been properly updated.
The result is a somewhat surprising situation whereby the Union is not using the same criteria as a basis for its negotiations with the Gulf states as it uses with its other trade partners, such as Korea or the ASEAN countries.
In particular, the negotiating mandate makes no provision for inclusion in the future agreement of any clause on social standards, nor any ambitious chapter on sustainable development.
The issue of respect for human rights is scarcely mentioned.
Since these elements must be part of the priorities of European action, not only should they be fully integrated in the future free trade agreement, they should also be subject to suspension clauses for cases where the commitments are not fulfilled.
It is the EU's responsibility to ensure that all the trade agreements it negotiates guarantee promotion of, and respect for, the democratic principles of human rights, the conventions of the International Labour Organisation and environmental standards.
In the case of the Gulf states, special attention - and Mr Martin has just mentioned this - must be paid to the living conditions and rights of migrant workers.
There are many such workers in the region to support the rapid growth there but they often work under disgraceful and unacceptable conditions.
More generally, over and above the trade that must be developed within the framework of harmonious trade relations, Europe and its Member States must step up their political and social dialogue.
We must therefore implement a free trade agreement that not only does not have a negative impact on the people living in the region but, on the contrary, consolidates their political, economic and social rights.
That is why it is essential, for example, to ensure that during negotiations on services, the need to guarantee a universal public service that is accessible, sustainable and cheap, and that meets high quality standards, is respected.

I voted to adopt Mr Florenz's report entitled '2050: the future begins today - Recommendations for the EU's future integrated policy on climate change'.
This report was drawn up by the Temporary Committee on Climate Change, which was appointed in June 2007.
The report is a specific list of recommendations concerning reductions in carbon dioxide emissions, to be implemented by the Community bodies (mainly the European Commission) and the Member States.
In order to achieve these objectives, it will also be necessary to take action at local level.
Changes in our climate are sudden and have serious negative consequences.
The EU and the industrialised nations should adopt the target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by between 25% and 40% by 2020 and, in the long term, aim to reduce emissions by 80% by 2050, in comparison to 1990 levels.
The remaining recommendations contained in the report include partnership and cooperation, in the field of solar energy production, with third countries in the Mediterranean basin, achieving zero net energy consumption in new residential buildings by 2015, and in all new buildings by 2020, with the option of expanding this target in the long term and including renovated buildings.
The plans also include the creation of a European renewable energy community, with the aim of supporting research and development activities to develop groundbreaking new technologies.
<D>
in writing. - (SV) The June List believes it to be possible to halve the Member States' fees to the EU.
The largest part of the EU's money is spent on unnecessary or socio-economically damaging activities, including agricultural policy, the Cohesion Fund, fisheries policy and subsidies for different types of information campaigns.
In addition, there are the costs of the European Parliament's commute between Strasbourg and Brussels and of institutions such as the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, which should be disbanded immediately.
Agricultural policy is particularly objectionable.
The money goes from consumers to often very rich recipients.
Farmers in the poor countries of the world lose out as a result of competition from the subsidised farmers of the EU.
There is a constant stream of exhortations from various EU institutions to the Member States about how important it is for them to reduce their public expenditure.
At the same time, this House constantly demands increased expenditure at EU level.
The whole thing is absurd.
Member States spend public money on schools, health care, research, infrastructure and support for vulnerable groups in society, while most of the EU's expenditure goes on a lunatic agricultural policy, misdirected Structural Funds and the financing of EU institutions that should have been closed down a long time ago.
Our 'no' to the draft budget should be interpreted as a demand for a dramatic cut in the expenditure in the EU budget and a halving of the fee payable by Member States to the EU.
<D>
Early years education has far-reaching implications on children's future development and their chances of success later on.
Investments made during this period reduce the costs incurred later relating to health matters, the crime rate and antisocial behaviour.
Nevertheless, the provision of early years education is unequal across the European Union.
However, it would be difficult to implement a 'one size fits all' approach.
I think that we need to focus rather on establishing a common framework with clearly defined objectives and values.
According to the target set in 2002, EU Member States must offer early years education to 90% of children between the age of three and the compulsory school age.
There is also an economic rationale behind this, given the rise in the number of women on the labour market.
It is vital for us to involve the minority population in early years education programmes, especially the Roma population, which is often disadvantaged.
We must also ensure that a sufficient number of childcare places are available so as to avoid long waiting times for enrolling children in this kind of institution.
We must not overlook either the qualifications of the staff working with young children, who have a crucial impact on the quality of education provided.
<D>
Inequalities in health constitute a problem to be addressed at European level.
The reasons often stem from differences in terms of opportunities, access to services and material resources, as well as from different life choices made by individuals.
We need an innovative political outlook to address them.
The economic and financial crisis of recent years has resulted in a reduction in the level of funding for health services and long-term care as a result of budget cuts and reductions in tax revenue, while the demand for health services and long-term care has increased.
Numerous Member States have included in their recovery plans measures such as investments in healthcare restructuring and additional financing of the health system.
Interventions to tackle health inequalities, however, vary widely from state to state.
The collection and sharing of data on strategies, policies and effective interventions will help to obtain support from governments.
It is essential that the reduction in health inequalities should be considered a high priority, by pursuing such an approach based on 'health in all policies' and ensuring effective impact assessments that take into account the results obtained in terms of equality in health.
<D>
in writing. - The resolution of the Parliament, approved today by a large majority, rightly concentrates on the immediate issues of ensuring the safety of products under existing EU directives.
The EPP-ED group has insisted throughout that the resolution should concentrate on practical proposals that would reinforce consumer safety, without delay.
We have, in addition, proposed the evaluation of a European Consumer Safety label, to be applied on a voluntary basis by providers of consumer goods.
We are pleased that the Parliament has endorsed this proposal.
We will take an intense interest in the future Toys Directive, and will examine the Commission's proposed reforms with an open mind.
In our view, the attempt to introduce very detailed and specific requirements for this future Directive in this resolution was entirely unnecessary.
We have therefore voted against these proposed additions, but this in no way diminishes our interest and concern to bring about an effective and workable directive when we receive the Commission proposal in 2008.
<D>
(PL) Mr President, this is one of the most important debates - both political and economic - here in Parliament, as is borne out by the make-up of those who have contributed to it today.
This debate concerns not only the rise in food prices, but also deaths caused by hunger.
Today's voices in this Chamber and the alarming analyses say what they say.
The price of wheat has risen by 130% in the last year alone, that of soya by 87% and that of rice by 74% - these are facts.
During the last 30 years we have brought prices down, but what has happened during the past year has trumped all the warning signals.
The facts are as follows: there is a worldwide shortage of food; there is hunger - 850 million people are going hungry.
In a dozen or more countries there have been riots, and these will get worse.
Tropical forests have been felled en masse, along with the Amazon Rainforest - in other words, the desire for biofuels outweighs the desire for a reduction in world hunger.
During the next few years there will be a global shortfall of 200 million tonnes of grain.
Global inflation will rise, there will be a continuing water shortage, and consumers in Europe will be forking out 30-40% more from their wallets than they did a year ago.
What should we do?
Urgently reform the common agricultural policy, as there are millions of farmers in Europe too who are suffering from poverty, and convene an international conference at the first available opportunity that will take certain decisions and draw certain conclusions from this discussion and this problem.
<D>
Mr President, the right to consular and diplomatic protection is one of the pillars of European citizenship.
Minister, you cited Article 20 of the Treaty.
It is very clear.
Every citizen has the right to consular protection.
It is not an option, it is a right.
The dramatic events in Mumbai show us, in actual fact, that this right is far from being guaranteed.
Levels of protection vary from Member State to Member State, resulting in discrimination in the treatment of citizens who are never given information about the consulate to contact in the event of need.
Financial support is visibly lacking between the Member States.
European citizens who have lost everything must often face consular offices that are very reluctant to bear the financial costs.
Member States have a duty to put an end to this situation.
It is necessary to make guidelines binding and to make information available to citizens.
The Union must start negotiations with third countries in order to ensure the necessary diplomatic protection.
However, as you said, Commissioner, the events in Mumbai have also shown the unacceptable absence of a guarantee of diplomatic protection for Members of the European Parliament.
The European Union and the Commission in particular must negotiate without delay, and we heard what you told us, Commissioner, and the Council must conclude ad hoc agreements with third countries in order to ensure specific diplomatic protection for Members of the European Parliament.
This is the least we can do.
<D>
Mr President, my political group voted in favour of the urgent procedure for the recovery plan for bluefin tuna because it is essential that the new measures should be in force before the season begins in April.
I would also like to remind everyone, however, that no recovery plan will save the bluefin tuna until fishing capacity is reduced, starting with that of certain Community fleets, which are well-known and have been pointed out in this respect for many years.
For all these years, the Member States in question have allowed their vessels to multiply to scandalous levels, while the European Commission has stood by passively.
That has brought us to this situation, in which there is hardly any way out.
When the current recovery plan was adopted in 2007, I tabled an amendment, which was adopted by the House and incorporated by the Commission in its final text, obliging the Member States to submit fishing plans showing that their fleet capacity was adapted to the quota allocated to it.
Despite that, the fishery again had to be closed early in 2008, earlier in fact than in the previous year, when it was found that practically the whole Community quota had been used up in just a few weeks; that is to say, we were doing even worse.
Article 5 of the new recovery plan now obliges Member States with overcapacity to eliminate at least 25% of it by 2010.
Not only does that reduction seem to me to be incredibly mild compared with the excesses that have been committed, but, given the precedents, I am exceedingly concerned at the ability of the Commission and the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) to enforce this obligation, in view of the clear lack of political will that the Member States involved have more than demonstrated.
I therefore beg the Commissioner to give us guarantees here and now that this lack of political will will not rub off on the Commission and that this time, the Commission will show some firm action that goes beyond closing the fishery early again this spring.
<D>
(PL) Mr President, the conditions under which the economy operates are constantly changing.
As a result, ongoing changes in many sectors are required, and we are today concerned with changes in the operation of railways, and in particular with the safety of their operation.
Accordingly, the relevant provisions need to be systematically brought into line with the current situation.
Many changes have taken place recently.
These include the enlargement of the Schengen Area to admit a number of countries whose railway systems vary considerably where technical conditions are concerned.
In addition, railway monopolies have been done away with in many countries and undertakings owning the network have arisen, along with regional and international transport undertakings.
This all calls for tightening up of the definitions and principles of procedure related to ensuring security on the territory of the Union.
The situation will largely be resolved by amending national provisions to take account of developments.
The proposals contained in the report by Mr Costa represent added value in this regard.
Mr Costa has proposed changes aimed at simplification, such as transferring Article 14 of Annex VII to the directive on interoperability.
This will significantly improve the readability of the directive.
Establishing clearer responsibility for safety is fundamental.
I should like to thank Mr Costa for all the work he has done preparing the report.
<D>
I voted for this resolution, which is a step in the right direction as regards the reaction of the European Union to the revolution, which is degenerating into civil war, in Libya.
Revolutions are a dream that becomes reality, but civil war is a nightmare.
With the opponents losing ground under fire from Gaddafi's troops and mercenaries, and the Colonel sending emissaries to European capitals in an attempt to save his regime, we need to show the Libyan people that we stand by them.
We have heard the appeal that the Interim Transitional National Council made on 5 March.
It is our duty to support this alternative and to protect the Libyan people against the forces of the regime.
With no direct military presence on Libyan soil, a no-fly zone should be considered.
But the decision rests with the UN.
However, this option could only be envisaged with the explicit consent of the Arab League.
At a political and diplomatic level, we have to ensure that Colonel Gaddafi is isolated and help the Libyan people to finally regain their freedom.
<D>
President-in-Office of the Council. - The process of shaping the forces for the European mission to Chad, which did not go so smoothly, was completed by 11 January this year to the extent that the commander was able to recommend commencement of the operation.
On 28 January the Council confirmed the operation plan, the so-called 'o-plan', and adopted a decision on its commencement.
As we know, the Irish General Patrick Nash is commanding the operation.
The force consists of 3 700 soldiers from 14 Member States.
These forces are composed, equipped and trained to fulfil their mission satisfactorily in a difficult environment.
Their rules on the use of force are strict and in line with the mandate laid down in Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter.
As we know, that mandate was given in Resolution 1778 of the United Nations Security Council.
The European Union's operation, known as the EUFOR Chad-Central African Republic operation, will be conducted for one year from the date of declaration of the initial operational capability and will be neutral and impartial.
Planning was executed from the outset in close cooperation with the United Nations.
To ensure transparency, efficiency and the possibility of modifying the measures, appropriate coordination mechanisms have been established at all levels, in New York and Brussels, at operation headquarters in Paris and on the ground.
After recent clashes between government forces and Chadian rebel groups, the security situation in Chad is now more stable.
The deployment of the EU mission is continuing and we expect EUFOR to reach its initial operational capability by mid-March.
Let me mention some decisions adopted by the Council at the last session on Monday, the day before yesterday.
The Council expressed its deep concern regarding the regional ramifications of the conflict in Darfur and attempts of overthrowing the Chadian government.
It backed the African Union and the United Nations' call for the respect of the sovereignty, national unity and territorial integrity of Chad.
The Council stated that recent events underscored the need for the deployment of the mission to Eastern Chad, where their task should be to increase security.
The Council has also stressed that, in the observance of its mandate, the mission will be impartial, neutral and independent.
I will finish by adding that the Council will closely follow the security situation in Chad and Western Darfur at all levels and also assess the consequences of this situation for the EUFOR mission.
<D>
(PL) Madam President, President-in-Office, President of the Commission, I would like in particular to thank the President-in-Office for taking on the presidency and congratulate you on a difficult, but successful first two weeks in the presidency.
I perfectly understand your words on national identity, an identity which we, the countries between the east and the west of Europe, have built up successfully.
I would like to draw your attention to a matter that I believe will be crucial in these six months: the third energy package.
This package deals firstly with the common energy market, a common European agency for cooperation between national regulators, cross-border connections and joint investments, and therefore with integration - in other words, with energy solidarity and secure energy supplies.
Secondly, the third energy package also means liberalisation, the fair regulation of access to networks, that is, competition on the market, which means lower costs and damage to the environment and cheaper energy for consumers, and hence for the economy, which will help to deal with the crisis.
And thirdly, the third energy package fair rules for the operation of countries outside our markets, with common policies for supplying the EU countries and the possibility of transportation through third countries.
In the context of the EU's eastern partnership and eastern dimension, the third package clearly speaks for itself.
The third package can be benefit each of the three main priorities of your presidency - energy, the economy, and Europe's eastern dimension.
I call upon you to keep this priority and to fully ...

<D>
in writing. - (SV) The situation in Georgia and the position taken regarding it are foreign policy issues.
The opinion of the June List is that neither the European Parliament nor any other EU institution should issue a statement on such matters because foreign policy is to be pursued at national level, not by the European Union.
Hardly surprisingly, the European Parliament is making the most of the opportunity to issue propaganda in favour of a stronger common foreign and security policy and, even worse, the implementation of the Lisbon Treaty.
Here today we can already see that different Member States have different opinions on the question of Georgia.
Thus it is not desirable for the EU to speak with a single voice because that voice will have to speak counter to the opinions of many Member States.
The numerous references to NATO are also very problematic as there are countries which are members of the EU but not members of NATO.
The situation in Georgia is very serious, especially in view of all the civilian victims of the conflict.
However, the EU should not pursue a foreign policy and therefore we have voted no to this resolution.
<D>
Mr President, the debate today shows how sensitive this matter is to the European Parliament.
The topic of the day is the raison d'être for us.
It is about the wellbeing of Europeans in the future.
We have our different opinions about the tool bag - how we reach the Lisbon goals - but I think everyone in this House wants to reach the goals.
Even though I agree with Ms Jäätteenmäki that, unfortunately, we have not seen a lot of progress.
I think we have to speak about two different levels of action.
First, at European level, we have only one key thing we should do in order to increase competitiveness and that is the single market.
The European internal market is the biggest driver of competitiveness in a global context.
We also have a lot of red tape and we need to work with our SMEs - these are very much the key to European success.
Of course, then we need to concentrate on things at national level, at Member State level, and there we need much more action than we have seen lately, especially regarding the structural reforms to the labour market.
We heard today the Prime Minister of Sweden, who spoke about the importance of structural reforms to the labour market, also in terms of coping with demographic changes.
I think it is self-evident that Member States have not done their duty in this respect.
Also, I think that, on fiscal policy and macroeconomics, we have to end the era of budget deficits.
We really need to work on our macroeconomics.
This cannot be done by the Union, even though we have a single currency.
It must be done by the Member State politicians.
Finally, I would like to agree with Ms Starkevičiūtė, whose report is, I think, wonderful.
Financial services are one of the cornerstones of the internal market.
Financial services need much more attention, including at European level.
<D>
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (IT) Mr President, President of the Council, Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I believe I can share Commissioner Frattini's approach to the debate.
We need to look to the future, we need to understand how we can manage the time left to us with a sense of responsibility and commitment shared by all the European institutions.
We believe that after years of debate on the area of freedom, security and justice, in which this Parliament has been critical of the clear democratic deficit - such a tricky area for the fundamental rights of citizens - we can welcome the signature of the new treaty, which finally creates a European dimension in this area, and which gives Parliament full legislative powers, including on judicial, criminal and police cooperation and on entry and residence policies.
For this reason, my group also believes that, even during the delicate phase of ratification, no institution can escape the fact that the framework has completely changed.
We know it is not possible simply to bring forward the entry into force of the Treaty, but we believe it would be a mistake politically to carry on working on highly sensitive dossiers in a way that sidesteps the democratic scope of the Treaty of Lisbon.
For this reason, our group also believes that a joint commitment from Parliament, the Council and the Commission is necessary to identify any dossiers of particular importance, not to block their passage but to guarantee that Parliament can be consulted with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and to integrate them into the new institutional framework.
I am thinking in particular of the important dossiers on which until now we have merely been consulted, such as the proposal for a European PNR system, the proposal to revise the framework decision on terrorism, the directive on the admission of highly qualified workers and the directive on a uniform procedure for the admission of labour migrants.
May I take a few seconds, Mr President, to express concern over what the Council was saying about the Returns Directive.
We appreciate the Council's availability and cooperation, but we believe that there are a few extremely delicate points.
One in particular is that 18 months' detention is not considered an improvement in the effectiveness of this directive, but an oppressive measure on which a good many in this Parliament will continue to express their displeasure.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to think that I have learned a lot from my time here as European Commissioner.
Some people might contend that I have not, but I think I have.
But one thing that I have learned is that anything touching on the area of intellectual property is fraught with all types of pitfalls.
There have been a number of issues raised in this whole area of intellectual property in Parliament and the Council of Ministers, both in my time as Commissioner and in my time previously as an Irish government minister, and some of these issues have been around for 20/30 years.
So I have learned that any aspect of this topic gets a tremendous amount of coverage, generates a lot of debate and polarises a lot of Members of Parliament, Member States and different stakeholders.
So I have learned that it is exceptionally difficult to address anything in this area and try to reach an acceptable solution.
During my time here as Commissioner there have been many instances where we have failed to reach any agreement in certain areas.
That being so, I am not the least bit surprised at the depth and sincerity of the arguments put on all sides of this debate, because any issue relating to the intellectual property area always generate this kind of argument, and people who are on the opposing side of the compromise proposal put forward by Mr Crowley will be on totally the opposite side in other areas of intellectual property.
So it is very interesting, in this type of debate, to see people who would take one position in other areas of intellectual property taking a different position here, because this is a very difficult area, and I accept the sincerity of the people who have contributed.
There is little point in my going over all the various points raised individually and debating them, because they have been debated ad nauseam in the committee.
One thing that Mr Crowley and rapporteurs from other committees did is to give it a lot of time.
Parliament has given this an exceptional amount of time and an exceptional degree of effort, and many of the assistants and people in my own DG worked exceptionally hard on this to try and reach what we thought would be an acceptable compromise.
But I will touch on some of the areas.
Let me just eliminate a few points at the outset that do not relate so much to this debate as to what surrounded the earlier debate by which we came up with this proposal.
Let me assure you that the people who asked me to go forward with a proposal here were the performers - that is where the intensive lobbying came from.
If there is disagreement here in the House and in Member States, I can equally say there were different views in my DG on this issue when I first came to it as to how we should proceed, and many of the differing viewpoints put forward here were reflected there as well.
I think that is natural: if it generates such divided views here and in other Member States you can expect the same in the DG.
But I was lobbied fairly intensively by ordinary performers.
Yes, the high-profile performers came and lent their support to the cause, because the ordinary performers thought that it would be better to have some of the big names in this particular area as well, but the ordinary performers - the session musicians, who most people have never heard of - were the biggest lobbyists here.
I think it is significant to note that, as Mr Heaton-Harris said, 38 000 session musicians support this particular proposal.
So one has to make a judgement on which is the proper way to go forward.
I would say that most people know the singers of their favourite four songs or records, but I doubt very much that many of them know who actually wrote them.
But the writer of the song is entitled to life plus 70 years.
If I named six tunes here tonight out of the most popular tunes created, I doubt that there would be anyone in this Chamber who would be able to name who wrote the songs, but each one who knows a particular record would be able to say: that was sung by such and such.
The writer gets life plus 70, but the performer gets only 50 years from the date of his performance.
From any type of moral perspective that is unfair.
Some people had one hit song when they were 21 or 22 and were then never heard of again, and they did not make an awful lot of money out of it.
In their twilight years when they are approaching 70 and beyond I think it would be only reasonable that they could have a little bit of additional income.
You can boil down all the technical arguments and the intellectual arguments and everything else, but on the basis of fair play I think that argument wins out.
As Mr Crowley and others mentioned, this was a genuine attempt to address some of these issues - and some very conflicting issues.
We have done our best to get a proposal.
Mr Crowley has put an extraordinary degree of work into this area in trying to reach agreements and compromises and has worked long and hard.
I shall just refer to some of the issues raised.
Ms Gill, who is very supportive of the proposal and I thank her very much for her support, mentioned the 'use it or lose it' clause, which kicks in after a year, but, in the implementation in Member States, Member States can allow it to kick in after three months or six months if they so wish.
Ms Bowles - and I do not doubt for one moment her sincerity in this regard - feels she is not in a position to vote for this particular proposal or the compromise proposal put forward by Brian Crowley.
She mentioned the matter of contracts.
Well, I do not think the matter of contracts should kill the proposal.
It is definitely another issue which could be the subject of another initiative if - and only if - this proposal succeeds.
Ms Lichtenberger made a fine address.
I would point out to her that EUR 2 000 certainly is not peanuts for a session player.
The fund, as I said earlier, is endorsed by 38 000 performers and I think they should know.
Mr Medina Ortega, from his vast experience as a politician, made a very good point, and I agree with him that we have to propose something here that has a reasonable chance of flying in the Council of Ministers as well.
As he pointed out, we have to be realistic, because, with different views there as well, we have to come forward with a proposal - as Mr Crowley and others have done - that has a realistic chance of flying in the Council of Ministers, and he put that point very forcibly and well.
Mr Schmidt and Mr Musacchio made points about the existing label business models, but we are not endorsing the existing label business models.
A 70-year term is open to all new innovative business models.
Mr Holm referred to the possibility of being fined, for example, for singing Happy Birthday but I think he has his ideas confused here.
It is not about the song: it is only about its recording by a performer, so Mr Holm can sing Happy Birthday any time he wishes and he will not be in danger of being penalised in any way.
This is about the recording by the performer, not by the writer.
Mr Mavrommatis made a number of points which we have noted but I think 70 years is the best proxy for life.
In conclusion, I would like to express my appreciation and admiration for the efficient handling of this file by everybody involved in the European Parliament.
It has resulted in the compromise proposal put forward by Brian Crowley, and I think it demonstrates our willingness to improve the legal framework for our creative community.
I think that in the future it will show that protecting those who create was the right choice, and that increasing efficiency of rights management infrastructures will prove wrong those who claim that better protection will lead to a less thriving online culture.
I would like to thank everybody concerned with the debate, particularly the rapporteur Brian Crowley, not because he is a colleague of mine from Ireland and a long-standing friend, but because he has put in an extraordinary amount of work to try and make this compromise acceptable to as many competing interests in Parliament as possible and also facilitated a compromise which, as Mr Medina Ortega has said, has a reasonable chance of acceptance in the Council of Minsters as well.

(RO) The European policy concerning sustainable transport, taking account of the European policies on energy and environment, concerns and directly affects approximately 490 million of European citizens.
I asked the Commission and the Member States to examine the way in which transport infrastructures and the applicable tariffs influence urban development and future demands for transport services.
I asked the Commission and the Member States to intervene in the modernisation of port infrastructure, with respect to the European Union sea ports, as well as the ports located on the inland waterways, in order to enable the rapid transfer of freight and passengers from one transport system to another, thus facilitating the reduction of energy consumption in the field of transport.
In 2007, the European Union firmly and unilaterally committed itslef to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 20% compared to 1990 base values.
The implementation, especially in large urban concentrations, of intelligent transport systems in order to control traffic will prevent traffic jams which cost the European Union approximately 1% per year of its gross domestic product.
At the same time, the development of the European railway system will contribute to compliance with European policies in the field of energy and tackling climate change.
In this context, I believe that one of the development priorities in the field of trans-European transport should be to design a high-speed railway network linking all the capitals of the Member States.
High speed trains should also go through Bucharest and Sofia.
<D>
I agreed with the report because, as you know, the expansion in international trade is justified if it contributes to economic development, to job creation and to improved living standards.
Only then is trade liberalisation regarded as something positive and accepted.
By contrast, when it destroys jobs or undermines living conditions, social rights and the environment, it gives rise to very vocal opposition.
The common commercial policy cannot therefore be reduced to a set of measures designed to serve only the immediate interests of a few economic actors.
The economic and social impact of trade liberalisation varies very substantially from country to country and that impact must be managed and sometimes offset, because liberalisation is a process in which there are always winners and losers.
The expansion in international trade is universally beneficial only if certain conditions are met, hence the need to manage the liberalisation of trade, including practical arrangements and the volume of trade, a need which has come to be felt even more strongly as the globalisation process has accelerated.
Europe, and the international community as a whole, are thus faced with an imperative: they must incorporate genuine guarantees concerning sustainable development and labour rights into the rules governing international trade.
That imperative, which is consistent with the objectives of both the United Nations and the European Union, chimes exactly with public expectations in Europe.
Hitherto, the link between trade and corporate social responsibility (CSR) has been tenuous at best.
Incorporating CSR principles into the rules governing international trade would enable the EU to exert pressure on undertakings to improve their behaviour and on the States which sign trade agreements with it to comply with labour and environmental standards.

Madam President, I do not share the views of my colleagues who blame the Commission for their non-delivery.
I think the biggest mistake the European Commission could have made would have been to think that more regulation is always the right answer.
All proposals from the Commission should be proportionate, balanced and well-targeted.
I have been moderately content with how this Commission has responded until now, and I remain confident that the Commission has all the right tools to improve the regulatory framework for financial services.
Improvements should be based, in the first place, on existing legislation and legal bases.
In the second place, soft-law measures should be considered, and finally, if there is no improvement otherwise, then we should turn to legal, new regulations.
I think that sometimes there is a tendency to forget how much we have already done in Europe.
Since 2000 we have gone through a serious overhaul of our financial services laws, and we have updated many of the relevant regulations already.
We have a modern and sophisticated legal framework in Europe.
I think it is followed by most of the people in America already, so I do not think we need to radically change our approach.
Finally, I would like to say that it of course needs to be considered that the supervisory framework is not as good as it could be.
We should develop - based on the ECOFIN road map - the way the supervisors work in Europe, but also we should remember the global scale of things.
We should remember that the financial industry is probably the most global industry in today's world, and we cannot act in a vacuum.
We should remember that we are living together with the outside world, and we should try to develop standards, mutual recognition and convergence with transatlantic players - because that is the way to currently open competition - and also very good rules on the protection of retail clients and the way these things go forward.
Finally, one thing about the ECB.
I think we need to thank the ECB.
The ECB did a very good job.
The consequences to the European economy, both in the financial economy and also the real economy, would have been much more severe without the very good delivery of the ECB in terms of liquidity.
I think the ECB should be congratulated for that.

Few question the importance of children receiving physical education at school.
The negative trend of unhealthy lifestyles among young people appears to be increasing from year to year.
Mr Schmitt's report therefore touches on a pressing and important subject.
The problem with the report, not least with regard to the paragraphs voted on individually, is that Mr Schmitt goes a very long way.
It is difficult to see why the EU in particular should regulate in detail the number of hours of physical education at school, not only for primary school pupils but also for secondary school pupils.
Nor can I see any reason for Brussels to micromanage physical education, with demands for mixed gender groups and special sex education.
The last paragraph, which aims to set up a special system of commendation for various types of voluntary work, looks particularly strange, not because dedicated Europeans do not deserve appreciation, but because it is difficult to see how such a thing would be structured, administered and financed.
There is no doubt that the aim of the report is good.
However, the current formulation has turned out very dubious.
That is why I voted no.
<D>
rapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, the report which we have produced for debate and approval today embodies a 2005 initiative, in which the seven Member States decided to step up cross-border cooperation in all areas relating to terrorism, organised crime and illegal immigration.
The German Presidency proposed incorporating part of this agreement in the Community acquis by means of a framework decision, that is to say under the third pillar, on the lines of what was done with the Schengen Agreement, leaving aside, however, the matter of illegal immigration which, according to the Tampere mandate, should come under the third pillar.
It is therefore regrettable that clear Community powers were not included in the international treaty, since this not only creates judicial confusion, but leaves us with two legal frameworks of reference.
The first was negotiated in a less than transparent manner.
National parliaments were not consulted, nor was the European Parliament.
We were only consulted at the last minute, in haste and in a non-binding manner as the instrument was about to be incorporated into the Community acquis.
The report of our unfortunate fellow Member Fausto Correia sets out the position of the European Parliament on this matter.
Today we are pleased to be able to say that the Council consultation is being presented on the basis of the codecision procedure.
This is a consultation which does not confine itself to the agreement itself but includes its preamble and annex, which we appreciate, because, although they are technical, they contain provisions which are of great political significance.
Many of them are designed specifically to ensure the protection of personal and sensitive data.
However, we are sorry that the Council has still not approved the framework decision on the definition of data protection in order to lay down certain minimum rules.
It is incongruous for the Council to prepare to adopt this decision rather than its own general law.
Nor was the European Data Protection Supervisor consulted at any time.
Briefly, the report provides for cooperation in terms of exchanging data on DNA, fingerprints, vehicle registration numbers and personal and non-personal data.
The aim is to be able to compare the DNA profile of a person with the future databases of 27 national contact points.
The report clearly indicates that common guarantees must be laid down for the protection of data and the right of defence of suspects and guilty parties.
Only the non-coding parts of DNA, in other words the zones containing no genetic expression, may be transferred.
All shared information must indicate the stage of the proceedings affecting the person concerned and the database from which the information was obtained.
The European Parliament must be consulted again if the Council wishes to alter the initiative of the Federal Republic of Germany in any way and particularly regarding the number of loci needed to make accurate comparisons.
I would also remind the Council that the Conference of Representatives of the Governments of the Member States called for the possibility of incorporating this framework decision in the new Lisbon Treaty system, in order to allow recourse to the Court of Justice.
I would also like to point out that, in the paragraph relating to officers and the possibility of cross-border cooperation, I do not agree with the part approved in committee, which gives officers powers to detain and to take statements in a Member State other than their own.
Finally, ladies and gentlemen, bilateral cross-border cooperation has always existed but this decision will be a first in terms of Europe-wide cooperation.
It is true that there is concern, serious concern, that, despite good intentions, the proliferation of networks may lead to abuse and possibly to serious mistakes.
Protecting the innocent is without doubt the foremost concern of everyone and of our House in particular, given that it represents all our citizens.
<D>
(HU) As a lawyer working with human rights issues, I cannot understand what the added value would be for the protection of the human rights of Europe's citizens if the European Union joined the same human rights convention that every single European country has already joined.
Please allow me to clarify a few connections, because as I see it, our non-lawyer colleagues have been considerably misled.
The situation is as follows.
There is a human rights instrument that is indeed very important, known as the European Convention on Human Rights.
This Convention is not one entered into by the European Union but by its quasi-twin, the Council of Europe.
If a country violates its citizen's rights as set out in and provided by the Convention, then that citizen has the right to approach the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg and seek legal redress or enforcement of his or her rights against that country.
This opportunity, as everyone knows, is available now to all citizens of the European Union.
I doubt there is a single Member amongst us who is not familiar with a case where someone in their country threatened to go all the way to Strasbourg, and eventually did so and won the case against his or her Member State.
What, then, is new, what is the added value, apart from someone from the European Union network receiving a well-paid job as a judge in Strasbourg?
<D>
President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, I welcome this opportunity to speak on these three important legislative proposals, and am grateful to the rapporteurs for the extensive work which has gone into their reports.
I would like first to comment on the first two proposals, and then to turn to the third proposal on the issue of the further development of criminal justice within the EU.
The objective of the two proposals covered by the reports from Mr Zwiefka and Mr Deprez is to establish a procedure which will allow the Member States to negotiate and conclude agreements with third countries on aspects of judicial cooperation in civil matters falling within the exclusive competence of the Community.
The first proposal, subject to the codecision procedure, covers applicable law in contractual and non-contractual obligations.
The second, subject to the consultation procedure, covers certain matters in the area of family law.
I would like to underline that the procedure put in place by the two future regulations is devised in such a way as to ensure the integrity of Community law.
Before authorising the negotiation of an agreement, the Commission will check that the envisaged agreement does not render Community law ineffective or undermine the proper functioning of the system established by its rules.
The Commission will also check that the envisaged agreement does not undermine external relations policy as decided by the Community.
It could in fact be argued that, by making it possible for Member States to negotiate and conclude agreements with third countries that are compatible with Community law, the range of operation of Community law is extended to countries outside the European Union.
The procedure established by the two proposals will apply primarily to the negotiation and conclusion of bilateral agreements between a Member State and third countries.
It will in certain cases, however, also apply to the negotiation and conclusion of regional agreements between more than one Member State and/or more than one third country.
As far as regional agreements are concerned, the procedure established by the proposal in the area of the family law will apply to the amendment or renegotiation of two already-existing conventions between the Nordic States.
In the proposal in the area of applicable law, only a few regional arrangements will in fact fall within its scope.
These could cover, for example, the operation of an airport situated in a border area, waterways common to two or more countries, or cross-border bridges and tunnels.
The procedure established in the two proposals is based on a high degree of trust and cooperation between the Member States and the Commission.
A mechanism is provided to deal with those situations where the Commission, on the basis of its assessment, reaches the conclusion that the negotiation or conclusion of an agreement should not be authorised.
In such situations, the Member State concerned and the Commission will enter into discussions with the aim of finding a solution together.
The Presidency, on behalf of the Council, hopes and expects that it will be possible to reach a first reading agreement on the proposal in the area of applicable law.
Constructive negotiations have taken place between the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council, during which the three institutions have together managed to solve a number of difficult issues.
As the proposal in the area of applicable law is largely identical to the proposal in the area of family law, it goes without saying that the amendments made to the first proposal have been taken over in the second proposal, even though that proposal is not subject to the codecision procedure.
It is, in the interest of good law-making, highly desirable to maintain parallelism between the two texts.
I would like to conclude with a few comments on Parliament's recommendation on the development of EU criminal justice, which is the subject of the report by Ms Pagano.
The Council very much agrees on the importance of mutual recognition as a cornerstone of judicial cooperation within the EU.
We consider that it should both be broadened - by adopting other legal instruments in the future - and deepened, through a more effective implementation of the mutual recognition instruments adopted so far.
In this context, the Council would like to draw Parliament's attention to the fact that it is in the process of finalising the fourth round of mutual evaluations on the practical implementation of the European arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between the Member States.
Within the context of this series of mutual evaluations, experts have also been studying the issues related to interaction between, on the one hand, the European arrest warrant, and, more generally, the principle of mutual recognition, and, on the other hand, the proportionality principle.
However, the proportionality principle also has to be balanced with another principle, which is equally dear to Parliament - namely that of subsidiarity.
The reality is that judicial authorities in various Member States have differing views on what constitutes a serious offence.
The Council looks forward to further work with Parliament and the Commission on the establishment of a system of horizontal and continuous evaluation and implementation of EU policies and legal instruments.
On the issue of judicial training, the Council shares Parliament's opinion that there is a need to foster a genuine EU judicial culture by, inter alia, promoting direct exchanges between judges, prosecutors and members of the judicial staff of different Member States, and to actively develop the European Judicial Training Network.
The Council also shares Parliament's view on the need for a swift and effective implementation of the new Eurojust and Europol decisions.
By way of conclusion, I would like to thank Parliament for the extensive and detailed work which has gone into the three reports before us this afternoon.
<D>
on behalf of the UEN Group. - Mr President, I too recognise the importance of Pakistan to all of us in the fight against terrorism and it has been an ally to all of us in that fight.
However, I do not believe for one minute that it justifies in any circumstances what has happened in Pakistan in recent weeks.
Any deviation from the general democratic process cannot be a solution to solve political problems within Pakistan.
One of the things that really worries me about this is why he did it: because he was afraid that he was not going to get the decision from the Supreme Court that he expected or that he wanted.
It is a fairly trivial matter in one way and it seems that he has gone to extreme measures in his dealings with the people in Pakistan, with the judiciary in Pakistan, in the way he has dealt with it, which is extremely dangerous.
I welcome the fact that he has given a commitment that he will hold elections, but the international community must not allow him to turn his back on this commitment.
The state of emergency in Pakistan must be lifted immediately and the Government of Pakistan must respect the boundaries of its Constitution.
The scrapping of the Supreme Court did immeasurable damage to the separation of power systems within Pakistan.
It is a very, very poor example for the General to have undertaken.
I fully condemn the wholesale arrest of political opponents of the General, which include 3 000 peaceful protestors and civilian and human right activists.
The European Parliament today must send a very strong message out to General Musharraf that his recent actions violate all respected international conventions and he is moving Pakistan in a very negative and very dangerous direction.
<D>
(ES) Mr President, I first wish to congratulate the EP rapporteur, Mr Castiglione, for his splendid work.
The virtue of his report lies in that it includes many of the concerns expressed not only by ourselves as Members of the European Parliament, but also by the European wine industry.
Commissioner, there have been certain changes since you submitted this proposal for a new wine COM.
Some certain aspects have changed very little, while others have changed considerably, but I feel that many of the changes have been positive.
For example, grubbing-up is no longer the main focus of the reform, and I was pleased to hear you say earlier that the Commission is now working with a time frame of three years, as Parliament is requesting, and not five years as you had suggested.
This is a reform of a COM that is so important for European agriculture, as has been said from the outset, has some extremely positive aspects, and I thank you for that.
For example, the regulations have been simplified and made more flexible, and that will help to make us more competitive.
This point has already been made by Mrs Herranz in relation to the promotion of European wines within and outside Europe.
A large number of amendments have been tabled to your proposal to eliminate current market arrangements and replace them with a menu for national envelopes.
It is obvious that market measures have already helped to maintain income for farmers and economic activity in rural areas, and continue to do so.
Thus, without jeopardising Mr Castiglione's compromise, I wish to table a new amendment to secure direct aid for diversification, aid which the Member States could include in their national allocations to help farmers in the transition to the new COM.
The duration of this and the methods employed would be drawn up by the management committee.
Commissioner, I feel that for stakeholders used to working with this COM, with back-up from the current market measures, this is the way to help them through the transition to diversification and guide them into the new COM which - I hope - the House will adopt tomorrow.
<D>
in writing. - (PL) Mr President, the treatment meted out to Georgia by Russia is simply unacceptable by international standards.
It is abundantly clear that Russia is exploiting its economic influence in many EU countries to see how far it can pursue its neo-imperialistic ambitions.
It is doing its utmost to block all relations between Georgia and the West.
I wish to stress once again that EU or UN forces should immediately replace Russia's so-called peacekeeping armed forces in Abkhazia.
The European Union should constantly demonstrate full support for Georgia, as has been the case in the House today.
In addition, the Union should systematically strengthen cooperation and immediately introduce visa facilitation measures for Georgians, especially now that fully democratic elections have been held.
The resolution adopted today is an expression of precisely that kind of support for a sovereign Georgia.
I am glad that it was at the initiative of Law and Justice Members that a debate was held in the European Parliament at the beginning of May.
That debate resulted in today's resolution, which represents Europe's official stance on the issue of Georgia.
<D>
I voted in favour.
According to Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007, poultrymeat may be sold on the international market even if it has undergone anti-microbe treatments.
In June 2008, the European Parliament managed to approve a resolution prohibiting this type of marketing after several attempts.
Since the United States export only poultrymeat treated with chemical or anti-microbe substances to the EU, the Commission has, however, not honoured the resolution.
This strategy is at odds with the investments made by poultrymeat professionals in their field, in accordance with Community law, which states that only EU-approved protection methods, such as cold treatment, can be implemented in order to reduce the risks of meat contamination.
We therefore support the following proposals to amend Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007: 1) withdrawal of Commission Recital 5, stating that 'the exclusive reference to cold treatment in the definition of "poultrymeat” is too restrictive in view of technological developments.
This definition should therefore be adapted'; 2) replacement of Recital 5 with another requiring the source of the meat to be monitored in order to inform and guarantee transparency to the consumer; 3) maintenance of the cold method as the only protective treatment.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I will be very brief, as it is late.
I would like to remind the honourable Members that what we are discussing today is the date of introduction of the system.
A decision was correctly taken to put the system in place, but the date was left open, or rather a date was fixed which, it was decided, we should subsequently amend or confirm.
The data from a number of Member States showed two things.
First of all that implementation was feasible, both technically and economically - as is stated in the report - and also that more time was needed for the Member States to introduce the system, meaning that a more realistic date was needed.
The truth is that the Commission did propose to have this date set at a later stage.
I can assure you there was no intention to circumvent Parliament, and that is precisely why we chose this way of proceeding - having this debate, and not inserting an article in the regulation, which would have allowed us to take a decision with the Council alone.
There was never any intention on the part of the Commission not to include or involve Parliament in these decisions.
The setting of a date was considered to be a technical question.
Since the principle had already been adopted, we thought that this technical question could be adopted through comitology and, to repeat what I said earlier, we have no problem in accepting the amendment setting a specific date, which I believe allows Member States enough time - two years - to prepare.
However, we would be reluctant to agree to voluntary systems, since the regulation concerns traceability, and traceability has to be effective and applied equally in the Member States.
It is also a specific reflection of the animal health situation in the European Union.
One can look at the direct cost of the system as it appears, but, if you take the longer-term benefits of the savings generated by the reduction in losses and animal diseases, we believe it will eventually be of benefit from the economic point of view.
Nevertheless, we are ready to accept the amendment by Parliament, which we believe will also be adopted by the Council next week.
<D>
Mr President, on behalf of my political group I congratulate the committee on its report.
Congratulations are also due to my fellow Member for expressing Parliament's view in her report, even though on certain points we suggested amendments to improve it and to show, through Parliament's report, that we recognise what has happened on the basis of the roadmap for equality, and on the basis of the pact for gender equality.
We have had considerable quantitative success.
We still have to improve on how well we implement the measures.
We must ensure effective implementation and extended legal protection through the appointment of a competent body for complaints in each Member State by laying down sanctions based on the proportionality principle.
We also want the subsidiarity and free-choice principles to be maintained.
As far as work in the family combined with professional life is concerned, we do not want just working women to be covered.
Cover should extend to the unemployed, those who decide to be involved solely with their households, those in the liberal professions and those who are self-employed in family businesses.
We want to reinforce maternity and family leave.
We believe that the communication we are awaiting from the Commission will cover us at this point with a good proposal.
Since women study and work more, they deserve to be paid for all types of service provision.
<D>
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first of all to apologise for arriving a little late at Parliament, purely and simply because I underestimated the traffic between the hotel and Parliament.
I should like also to greet Commissioner Frattini, who is here with us, and to try to reply to the questions put by Members; I hope to provide all the clarifications we were asked to give.
There is no doubt that recent events in London and Glasgow, as well as on the border between Spain and Portugal plus the attack in Yemen, have confirmed that terrorism represents a considerable threat to Europe's security and to the values of our democratic societies, particularly to the rights and freedoms of European citizens.
We are in no doubt that Member States must therefore continue to cooperate on strengthening and implementing counter-terrorism measures, while always respecting human rights and fundamental freedoms, which are core values in our societies and their protection and promotion will help prevent terrorism.
Terrorism must be fought at both national and international levels.
International cooperation is an essential tool for an effective fight against this scourge, at both national and multilateral levels.
We know that terrorism represents a global threat and therefore needs a global concerted response, which will necessarily include increasing the flow and exchange of information, internal coordination of positions, coordination/partnerships with third countries, the implementation of a global counter-terrorism strategy with the United Nations playing a leading role, and close collaboration with various regional and international organisations involved in combating terrorism.
Action by the European Union has intensified since 11 September 2001 and, subsequently, since the dreadful attacks in Madrid in 2004 and in London in 2005.
In December 2005 the Council adopted the EU Counter-Terrorism Strategy, under which the Union commits itself to combat terrorism globally while respecting human rights, allowing its citizens to live in an area of freedom, security and justice.
The EU Counter-Terrorism Strategy covers four strands of work: prevention, protection, pursuit and response.
The Presidency confirms that the Council does in fact carry out a six-monthly review of the situation as regards implementation of the EU Counter-Terrorism Strategy and of the strategy against terrorist financing and an annual evaluation of the implementation of the Strategy for Combating Radicalisation and Recruitment to Terrorism.
The Council also reviews the Action Plan to Combat Terrorism every six months and the Action Plan on Radicalisation and Recruitment on an annual basis.
This monitoring process enables the Council to pinpoint which of the measures proposed at EU level have not been adopted, or have not been duly implemented at Member State level.
It also gives the Council an opportunity to take certain policies further.
For example, the Presidency decided to speed up work in the field of explosives.
The adoption of certain measures in the field of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters has been slowed down by the need for unanimous decision-making in this field.
The adoption and implementation of counter-terrorism measures will be speeded up by the ratification of the Treaty to be approved by the Intergovernmental Conference, on the basis of the mandate adopted by the European Council at its last meeting in June.
As regards the need for closer cooperation between the law enforcement and security information services, Member State security services are currently working in close and very efficient collaboration within the Counter-Terrorism Group.
Europol has developed very effective analysis files that are increasingly supplied with information by Member State law enforcement services.
There is no doubt that more needs to be done.
The European Parliament maintains a close direct political dialogue with the Council and the Commission.
On 16 May 2007 the President of the Council, the Vice-President of the Commission and the Chairman of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs met to examine the various counter-terrorism policies and to take stock of the implementation of the EU Counter-Terrorism Strategy.
These six-monthly meetings are extremely useful for reaching a consensus on the policies to be developed in the field of combating terrorism.
As regards the position of the EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator, the Secretary-General/High Representative informed Member States that he was considering, in close collaboration with the Presidency, how best to coordinate work in the field of counter-terrorism within the Council.
As regards the relation between the EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator and the Situation Centre, SitCen takes no part in the drawing up of EU counter-terrorism policy or in the coordination of work in the field of counter-terrorism carried out by the Council; nor does it monitor follow-up to the Council's decisions.
In the field of combating terrorism its competence is limited to presenting to the Council strategic assessments of terrorist threats on the basis of information received from the national services.
It also supports the EU emergency and crisis coordination arrangements which may be implemented in order to help coordinate an EU level response to serious crises, which would potentially include terrorist attacks.
That is a mechanical function which includes disseminating information, providing meeting facilities and supporting the institutions' existing decision-making arrangements.
It is not a coordinating role.
Nevertheless, it was on the basis of a threat assessment drawn up by SitCen that Council approved policy recommendations in various fields, such as the field of explosives, to prevent illegal use by terrorists.
The Presidency has no doubt that its efforts in the fight against terrorism are supported by European citizens who, moreover, at the time of the most recent attacks, amply demonstrated not only their solidarity with the victims of those attacks, but also their desire for an EU response to be developed.
In the drawing up of such a counter-terrorism strategy the Presidency has the support of its partners who bring their ideas to the high-level discussions, and the European Parliament, in particular, plays a vital role.
Compliance with the provision in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union is of paramount importance for the Council, as indeed is compliance with all the other articles of the Treaties.
Cooperation and dialogue with third countries are the mainstays of the EU Counter-Terrorism strategy.
In this half year alone there are plans for three-party style dialogue with Russia, the United States of America, Algeria and Morocco, which reflects the interest in broadening the dialogue with those countries.
The European Union also maintains anti-terrorism dialogue with other countries and international organisations.
Then, as regards our Mediterranean partners, we shall be holding our customary ad hoc Euromed experts' meeting on terrorism, which will provide the opportunity to have wider discussions with our Mediterranean partners on a matter of vital interest in that region, and which will focus upon the implementation of priority areas of the Euro-Mediterranean Code of Conduct on Countering Terrorism.
It should be mentioned that, with specific reference to the United States of America, the Presidency holds regular talks with various bodies and at the most varied levels on combating terrorism, which cover subjects such as radicalisation and recruitment into terrorism, including Internet use by extremist groups, terrorist threat analysis, cooperation in international forums, public/private partnerships for combating terrorism, specifically explosives safety, critical infrastructure protection, terrorist financing, in addition to other types of cooperation between civilian authorities and the police authorities.
The Portuguese Presidency is to organise, in conjunction with the United States, a workshop on the application of financial sanctions for combating terrorism.
The question of respect for human rights in the fight against terrorism has also been broached by both parties on various occasions and the Presidency considers that it is very important to continue that dialogue which it regards as crucial for both sides.
In conclusion on this point, I would mention that strengthening the area of freedom, security and justice based on the Hague programme and the relevant plan of action, is one of the main priorities of the joint 18-month programme of the German, Portuguese and Slovenian Presidencies.
The fight against terrorism is one of the great challenges in that area; the three Presidencies included among their aims greater cooperation to combat terrorism by means of implementing the EU Counter-Terrorism Strategy.
With your permission now, Mr President, I should like to reply to Oral Question.
I should like also to inform the House that the Council of the European Union makes a periodic review, as I mentioned, of the fight against terrorism and we also make an annual review of the Strategy and of the Action Plan for Combating Radicalisation and Recruitment to Terrorism; then every six months we review the strategy to combat terrorist financing.
The Council will shortly be presenting, for the first time, a report on the implementation of the communication strategy intended for the media and approved in July 2006.
Under the terms of the Counter-Terrorism Strategy a high-level counter-terrorism meeting must be held once per Presidency between the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament.
Such meetings were held under the Austrian and German Presidencies.
The role of the national parliaments will be strengthened under the new Treaty currently under discussion within the Intergovernmental Conference.
The major priority is the implementation of measures already in existence.
The Council employs various mechanisms for assessment, such the EU's peer evaluation process for national counter-terrorism measures, assessment of the implementation of the European Arrest Warrant, assessment of information exchange between Europol and the Member States and between Member States, etc.
New measures are already being analysed, such as the European Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection or measures concerning the bio-preparation technology programme, etc.
The Council has organised the assessment of information exchange between Europol and the Member States and between Member States.
The Secretary-General, Javier Solana, is considering how the function could best be fulfilled within the Secretariat General.
The mandate and brief of the possible new coordinator are also under consideration.
Like all the Institutions, the Council is committed to the provision contained in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union which states that the Union is based on the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law.
The promotion of those values is one of the EU's priorities.
The Member States' commitment to respect fundamental rights is also enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
Moreover, the Member States of the European Union, as members of the Council of Europe, are bound by the obligations arising from the European Convention on Human Rights.
The European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights strengthens the EU's capacity to monitor and collect information, thus promoting maximum respect for fundamental rights.
EU Member States must ensure that the measures they adopt to combat terrorism are consistent with their obligations under international law, especially international humanitarian, human rights and refugee law.
The Presidency considers that the fight against terrorism should be conducted in a manner which respects human rights given that the rule of law, good governance and the protection of fundamental freedoms are tools in the fight against terrorism.
That principle is central to the Counter-Terrorism Strategy adopted by the Council, as you know, in December 2005.
Turning now to the Judgment of the Court of First Instance of the European Communities of 12 December 2006 to which the question refers.
First I should like to mention that the Judgment in Case T-228/02 of 12 December 2006, known as the OMPI Case (Organisation des Modjahedines du Peuple d'Iran v Council of the European Union), does not justify the conclusion that the EU practice of terrorist lists is in breach of EU legislation.
The Court did not in fact rule against the practice of terrorist lists, but considered merely that some fundamental rights and guarantees, including the right of defence, the obligation to state reasons and the right to effective judicial protection are, in principle, fully applicable in the context of the adoption of a Community decision to freeze funds in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 2580/2001.
Secondly, it is public knowledge that the Council already systematically undertook the necessary revision of its procedures with respect to the list of persons and entities to which Regulation (EC) No 2580/2001 applies.
The Council adopted, in particular, the following measures to implement the judgment in Case T-228/02: it called attention to the possibility of contesting the Council decision before the Court of First Instance of the European Communities; it pointed out that it was possible to submit to the Council a request accompanied by supporting documentation for the decision as to inclusion or retention on the list to be examined - such requests are considered as soon as they are received; it provided all the persons, groups and entities for which this was practically possible with statements of reasons - in other cases the persons, groups and entities were informed by way of a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Union; it is carrying out an overall review of the list, at least once every six months, in accordance with the procedures described above, always with due regard to any supplementary information.
The Council also decided to create a new working party - the Working Party on Common Position 931 - which is to deal with requests for inclusions on or exclusions from the list and to prepare for the Council's regular review of the list.
The mandate, practical arrangements and the working methods of this new working party are contained in a public document adopted by the Council.
All those on the list to which Regulation (EC) No 2580/2001 applies are treated in the same way, as may be seen from the previous answer.
The role and competences of the institutions are laid down in the Treaties.
The Council takes the necessary measures required to implement the judgments of the Court of Justice in accordance with the provisions of Article 233 of the Treaty establishing the European Community.
As regards Parliamentary control over its decisions, the Council always follows the procedures laid down in the Treaties.
It is important to mention that the European Parliament, in accordance with Article 308 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, was consulted when Regulation (EC) No 2580/2001 was adopted.
Thank you very much for your attention.

Mr President, in the current economic climate, I think it is crucial that we do everything in our power to support those members of society who wish to contribute to our economy.
This is why the EU, in the past, has brought in legislation for maternity and paternity leave.
Working nine to five is not an option for all.
Therefore, there are many people who are self-employed - many of them women, who are often overlooked.
Better maternity protection would help spouses in agriculture, commerce and small businesses and encourage women to become involved in these vital industries, where they are now currently under-represented.
It is now or never for them - spouses or life partners, who must be given clear, defined professional status and benefit from at least an equal status of social protection as self-employed workers.
There is no 'return to sender' for them.
Member States should ensure that assisting spouses can become members of sickness and invalidity insurance schemes and pension schemes.
We have to end the travesty of women losing rights when they care or bring somebody into life.
<D>
The common security policy is a topic which has been debated many times and about which a great deal has been written.
The European Union is an increasingly important facilitator at regional and global level.
It is precisely for this reason that I feel that the European Union must be visibly active within its borders and proactive in any area of the world.
After examining the three reports today: the 2007 Annual report on the main aspects and basic choices of the CFSP, the European Security Strategy and ESDP and the role of NATO in the security architecture of the EU, I believe that we can come to three conclusions:
1.
The European Union must have a common security policy capable of supporting the democracies within its borders and the partnerships with the countries neighbouring it.
2.
The European Union must project the image of being a unitary whole and needs a rapid-reaction force capable of intervening at any time to support peace, democracy and human rights.
3.
The European Union must consolidate its position globally and continue to act as a facilitator for stability and balance between the major powers in the world.
<D>
author. - (FR) Mr President, Mr Borloo, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the increase in energy prices is having all kinds of negative effects, the most obvious being the rise in the cost of living for our fellow citizens.
This again illustrates just how reliant we are on energy.
Various actions are needed if we are to reduce energy price fluctuations and, more especially, drive down prices.
I have three proposals to make in this regard.
The first course of action concerns the economic management of energy prices.
This is something that has to be done right away, in other words the Member States need to develop financial mechanisms whereby the factor of rising prices can be deleted from company budgets and from household budgets too.
They also have to promote social measures aimed at combating energy poverty in low-income households.
The second line of attack is to work on the prices being charged for imported energy.
What are you proposing that will enable the European Union to speak with one voice when dealing with the producer countries - and people are always talking about 'speaking with one voice' - so that all these neighbourhood policies and partnership agreements can at last take proper account of the energy dimension?
Allow me, perhaps naively, to put forward a solution that might help ease relations in our negotiations with Russia.
Why not interconnect the Nabucco gas pipeline operation with the South Stream project?
Perhaps this would help calm things down a bit.
The third course of action is to reduce imports, or even stop them completely, which would be the ideal solution.
To achieve this we need to break the symbiotic link between increasing growth and increasing energy consumption.
It is really important that growth should not automatically generate a proportionate rise in energy consumption.
Of course we need to develop renewable and low-CO2 forms of energy, and the report presented by our colleague Mr Turmes is a step in this direction.
Being efficient in energy also means saving energy, which is something we are not doing sufficiently at present.
The texts that will be tabled here are therefore well overdue.
We need to focus on physical and technological energy storage capacities and indeed on those elements that are acting as vehicles for energy consumption.
Could you tell us, Mr Borloo, if you have high hopes of the energy-climate package being adopted at any time in the weeks ahead?
What would need to happen before an ambitious package of measures is put in place to meet these various objectives?
<D>
(RO) The use of plant protection products in compliance with efficient farming practices is vital to be able to produce a sufficient quantity of good-quality food, which will offer a high level of protection to the consumer's health and the environment.
Reducing the risks and impact associated with pesticide use and setting targets aimed at reducing how frequently these products are used will help guarantee sustainable farming.
The presence of a high level of pesticides in the food consumed in the European Union results from the dependency on these chemical products which, although necessary to help control any infestation and boost production efficiency, can have adverse effects on public health.
Some Member States, including Romania, are facing a high level of infestation affecting their agricultural land, with pesticide use seeming to be the best method for eliminating the pests.
For this reason, the proposals for implementing integrated pesticide management, the use of alternative substances and risk management will help yield suitable agricultural products which take into account the environment and public health safety, thereby reducing dependency on plant protection products.
At the same time, the large number of pests on Romania's agricultural lands means that we have to use treatments sprayed from airplanes.
However, once the directive comes into force, these spray treatments will only be applied when there are no viable alternative solutions to combating the pests, in order to provide the environment with an adequate level of protection.
I am pleased with the compromise result, which has received the backing of the majority of political groups.
It will also ensure a balance between the availability of plant protection products and, by implication, a sufficient quantity of food products, as well as help maintain European farmers' competitiveness and increase the level of protection for the environment and health.
<D>
In his explanatory statement, the rapporteur, with emotion in his words, urges the European Union to give the rest of the world the spare resources from its budget!
This is a peculiar and dangerous perspective on the management of public money, one that is accompanied by threats and apportionment of blame.
There was no need to go to these lengths to persuade us to help the countries most in need.
I would, however, like to make the following three points:
The explosion in global food prices certainly affects the populations of the developing world in particular, but it also affects millions of EU citizens.
What is the Commission doing for them?
Is it really necessary to entrust management of this emergency aid to the Commission, when the latter is largely responsible for this situation?
It is behind the agricultural Malthusianism in Europe, which contributes to the rise in prices.
Its trade policies promote export cultures in the poorest countries.
In the same circumstances, and with priority given, as it is, to the market and free trade, the proposed measures to support local agriculture appear doomed to failure.
Lastly, what is being done to combat the absurd and immoral speculation that reigns over the food commodities markets?
<D>
in writing. - (PT) The Charter of Fundamental Rights approved in Nice in 2000 is a list of common European values with which all citizens can identify.
These values result from the rich cultural heritage of the different EU countries, their constitutional traditions and laws, and characterise the Union not only as an economic entity but as a community of shared values.
The European Parliament has systematically requested that the status of primary law be conferred on the Charter, making it a central point of reference for the Court of Justice and national courts, and making it legally binding.
I am therefore very satisfied finally to see this confirmed and I am pleased to note that the draft Reform Treaty retains the substance of Part II of the Treaty establishing a European Constitution.
I am sorry that the Charter has been incorporated in the form of an annex rather than into the body of the Treaty as its importance warrants.
I am also sorry that the United Kingdom and Poland have exercised their right to opt out of this commitment to fundamental rights, although recent statements by the new Polish government seem to indicate a different attitude and one that is much more in keeping with the common spirit.
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Mr President, Commissioner, good evening, another evening discussing agriculture.
As the Commission notes in its report, in recent years remote sensing has shown how we can cope correctly with the management needs of the Common Agricultural Policy.
The traditional statistical and agricultural forecasting systems are beginning to become obsolete with the new technology which is invading all aspects of our lives.
It has also made possible improvements in the accuracy, objectivity, speed and frequency of observations as well as achieving savings in follow-up costs and monitoring of agricultural expenditure.
Remote sensing is, therefore, most welcome in the Common Agricultural Policy.
The draft report which will be put to the vote tomorrow generally endorses the European Commission, except on one point which I consider to be important as it concerns funding for the measure.
In the Agriculture Committee I supported the rapporteur's proposal to establish a specific budget for remote sensing of EUR 9.2 million outside the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund to safeguard future Community support for the development of remote sensing in all Member States.
I therefore welcome the outcome of the vote of the Committee on Agriculture, whose report also sets out the need to use the computer facilities of the Joint Research Centre site in Ispra to compile data from space, rather than the idea of creating a new computing infrastructure as proposed by the European Commission.
We should therefore streamline both the infrastructures and the financial budget, and we in the House should therefore support the document which will be put to the vote tomorrow.
<D>
Mr President, the Spanish Presidency is the first to take place under the new Lisbon Treaty.
Here is the first challenge.
We have the treaty, but we need its proper enhancement and even more than that.
The European Social Pact and European economic governance might be part of this 'more', but all these parts require more European financial resources and harmonisation of Member State tax policies.
Unfortunately, such endeavours have always been undermined by national governments.
I hope that the Spanish Presidency will be able to bring them together more than in the past.
The Spanish Presidency should cope with the two main contradictions of the European Union: the contradiction between pan-European needs and European national egoists, and the contradiction between the level of development in the western territories of the Union and that in the eastern territories, with their consequences in terms of political sensitivity.
There is a political sensitivity which is different in the two parts.
There is a sense of the need for more Europe, which is slightly different in the two parts following social and economic cleavages.
I hope that the Spanish Presidency will be able to cope with this.
These really are challenges which again require more common resources and better political coherence.
I therefore think that we not only need to read the Treaty, which is very right and gives us possibilities for more coherence, but also to provide...
(The President cut off the speaker)
<D>
The prospect of Iceland's accession has been well received.
However, contentious issues still exist, such as whaling, which is banned in the European Union, and Iceland's wish to protect its fisheries markets.
I do not think we can make any allowances in the case of whaling.
Regardless of historical factors, we cannot allow a situation in which a country applying for EU membership intends to catch these rare and protected animals.
Standards which were adopted and came into force in the European Community after many years of work cannot be 'bent' to fit a brutal reality for reasons of tradition.
Another question is the dispute over the size of mackerel catches.
As you know, despite appeals to observe the principles of responsible fishing, in 2010, the government in Reykjavik unilaterally established a total allowable catch for the species which was much higher than the limits put forward in scientific advice.
Iceland has not demonstrated the necessary openness and flexibility to achieve a compromise on this matter.
Furthermore, Iceland has announced that it will introduce catch limits for 2011 of 146 000 tonnes.
Such an approach fills me with fear when I think of future cooperation with Iceland on fisheries.
We all realise that this conflict jeopardises the accession negotiations with Iceland.
However, I personally think that in both cases, we should not agree to any concessions and should enforce compliance with the standards set by the Union in the fisheries sector.
<D>
(PL) Mr President, today I would specifically like to focus on the way in which the Israeli army is attempting to wipe out the Palestinian nation before our very eyes.
We should not remain indifferent to this issue.
I listen to Israeli media reports with embarrassment, I listen to soldiers recounting that they were told to shoot at civilians, including old women.
The newspaper Haarec has published the written command given by one of the military commanders to his subordinates.
He ordered his men to shoot at people helping wounded Palestinians.
Ultimately, the soldiers have also learnt to show utter disregard for Palestinian lives.
Proof of this can be found in the form of macabre T-shirts worn by Israeli soldiers, which show a pregnant Arab woman and bear the slogan 'one shot, two kills'.
We must break the silence which exists in this Chamber regarding this matter.
No nation is better or worse than any other.
Today, the Palestinian people need our help and support.
We should rise to the challenge and address this problem.
<D>
Mr President, I intervene in this debate first of all to thank the Council for its June action plan, but more particularly to welcome the very forthright statement by Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner.
It is shocking and scandalous that this Millennium Development Goal is failing and that we have made no progress since 2000 and no progress over the last 20 years.
Millions of women have died and tens of millions of children have been orphaned needlessly.
We know what is causing the deaths and we know how to prevent the deaths.
We have the resources, and indeed the knowledge to prevent them, and yet it is not happening.
Why?
Why are we failing?
It seems to me that we are allowing the conscientious objectors to block progress on these issues.
We have to push past the conscientious objectors - those who reduce this issue constantly to the issue of abortion and the provision of condoms.
Why anyone should see a condom as some kind of evil instrument boggles the mind and boggles reason!
I would urge those who are in a position to make decisions, and to pursue decisions, to ignore the conscientious objectors and get on with it.
<D>
(EL) Mr President, the fact that Parliament's view prevailed today over the Council's attempts to introduce biometric data records for six-year-old children is a victory for the fundamental principle that personal data can only be collected if it can be proven that it is necessary, proportionate and of course useful to do so, a principle which I fear the Council and the Commission have frequently ignored over recent years in their legislative initiatives.
In the case of children's passports and fingerprints, obviously children need their own passports with biometric identifiers in an effort to prevent abductions, child pornography and trafficking in children.
At the same time, however, it is obviously illegal to collect such identifiers if they are not necessary.
As far as fingerprints are concerned, we have studies which show that they are barely of any use for six-year-old children.
Their fingerprints change so quickly that passports and recognition from them are useless.
So today Parliament has achieved a balance.
It is demanding a serious study from the Commission in order to see when in fact children can be protected using their fingerprints, and will only allow them to be collected at ages at which we know for certain that this is the case.
Finally, in any case, as far as biometric identifiers in passports are concerned, we have said 'yes' for the purpose of recognising the holder, 'yes' for identifying the holder, 'yes' for ascertaining that the passport has not been forged, but 'no' to the creation of electronic data files on millions of innocent citizens.
<D>
President Arias, on behalf of the European Parliament, I would like to thank you most sincerely for this brilliant, distinguished speech.
Your words expressed that you and your country represent democracy and freedom; you work against violence, against terror, against dictatorship.
When you say that Costa Rica is a small country, then I would like to point out that the population of a country or its geographical area are not the most important things.
What is important is the spirit of a country and its president.
Anyone who has heard your speech knows that President Arias and Costa Rica stand for freedom and democracy.
That makes Costa Rica a big country in the world.
(Applause)
You are a man of peace; that is why you were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1987.
However, you did not retire after that; 21 years have passed, and now you are advocating peace between people and peace with nature.
The European Parliament stands alongside you in upholding these principles.
I would also like to give a warm welcome to the ministers of your government who are accompanying you - the Minister of Foreign Relations, Stagno Ugarte, and the Minister of Foreign Trade, Ruiz Gutiérrez, who are also here in the Chamber, together with many citizens of Costa Rica, who live here in Brussels and in Belgium.
Be proud of your country!
Not in a nationalistic sense, because then countries that have dictatorships and are ruled by violence could also be proud of themselves, but be proud of your country, of Costa Rica, because you champion the right values: democracy, freedom and peace.
Thank you very much once again.
Muchas gracias, President Arias!
(Applause)
<D>
(SV) Madam President, I am very pleased indeed that we have finally reached this point.
To start with many people said it was impossible, that it could not be done.
It could be done.
We are now supporting the citizens of Canada who want to stop being ashamed of their country's behaviour on the ice floes.
For thirty years we have attempted to control and to regulate this hunting.
This has not been achieved in either Norway or Canada.
The rules are not complied with out on the ice.
It is time to give up on the idea that it is possible to make this industrial scale commercial slaughter in any way humane.
We have the work of non-governmental organisations to thank for today's decision, and the majority of Europe's citizens who want this ban in place.
It is a victory for common sense, it is a victory for humanitarianism, it is a victory for democracy and not least it is a victory for all the seals that will be allowed to grow up without being clubbed and slaughtered simply for the sake of human vanity.
I would like to thank all my fellow Members who have made this possible.
<D>
(SV) Madam President, by supporting Mr Lamassoure's report the European Union can take a historic step.
With this report we can leave behind a time when the number of seats in the European Parliament was distributed on the basis of a system where different countries were categorised in different groups, on the basis of the negotiating skills of different heads of government, and where it is assumed that the EU's Member States have conflicting interests.
If Parliament chooses to support Mr Lamassoure's report, we will leave behind this system and move to one based on the proportionality principle, where a country's size affects its representation in Parliament.
The system that we have had up to now has been very difficult to explain, but the system that we can get with the Lamassoure report is possible to explain.
It is based on a maximum and a minimum level and on account being taken of the number of people in the different countries.
This principle is also tenable looking to the future.
It means that the interests of one country or another are not furthered, but the number of citizens is taken into account.
This is a step forward in the democratic process in the European Union.
I want it to be quite clear what alternative we are facing.
We either support the proposals set out in the Lamassoure report or we go back to the Nice agreement with its arbitrariness and negotiations marked by conflicting national interests.
When I hear the latest speakers from the benches up here and their agitation, I can also hear the national interests in relation to conflicts.
The Lamassoure report should be supported because it is based on a principle.
<D>
Mr President, in June of this year, Bosnia and Herzegovina signed a stabilisation and association agreement with the EU.
The country thus took a substantial step forward on its way towards membership of the EU, but the work is very far from complete.
The EU's commitment cannot and should not decrease in the belief that everything will now arrange itself automatically.
A whole series of challenges remains.
The constitutional reform has not been implemented.
The issue of state property in the Brčko district is still unresolved.
There are clearly widely different views, both in Bosnia itself and within the international community, as to when and how the High Representative's office should be closed.
I firmly believe that the closure of this office cannot be an objective in itself.
Rather, the objective should be that the requirements and conditions imposed on Bosnia by the Council for Peace Implementation should be fulfilled so that it is possible to transform the High Representative's office into the office of the EU's special representative.
In this connection, as in connection with the range of other challenges faced by Bosnia, it is very important that the international community should stand united.
To believe that the local parties in Bosnia itself will be able to agree on, for example, constitutional reforms, is naïve and, I would say, downright dangerous.
The new constitution needs to lead to a strong and common state if the country is to be able to continue to draw closer to the EU.
The political dialogue in Bosnia does not, however, indicate any interest in achieving this.
It is just as dangerous to believe that the commitment of the international community can decrease now that Bosnia has made a certain amount of progress and that the international military presence is continually being reduced.
On the contrary, it is now that the EU itself is assuming yet more responsibility.
Certain measures, such as making it easier for people to travel and study abroad, together with help in developing democracy and implementing the necessary reforms, are just a couple of examples of areas in which the EU can and should become more active.
Our commitment and the way in which we handle the situation in Bosnia over the next few months and years will be decisive, not only for the future and security of Bosnia but also for the future and security of the region as a whole.
<D>
(ES) Mr President, we Europeans cannot just say that we are very concerned but we very much hope that things will return to normal, because a return to normality at the price of accepting the fraudulent victory of Mr Kibaki is not a solution that we can accept.
In too many African countries, rigged elections have robbed citizens of all faith and hope in the democratic system.
Another case of this, this time in Kenya, would be lethal for the democratic hopes of Africa.
The solution can only come from strong external pressure.
Without strong external pressure the two leaders will not reach any kind of agreement, and we need to tell Mr Kibaki clearly that his Government is illegal and act accordingly.
Otherwise, our electoral observation missions would be pointless.
We have talked about the responsibilities of the African people, but we should also remember our own responsibilities.
For too long we have closed our eyes to what was going on in Kenya.
For too long we have sung the praises of that country as an example of democracy, forgetting the social inequalities and the corruption that was rife throughout the country: 16 billion dollars in aid have been received by that country since independence and there have been just four presidents.
Kenya is paying very dearly for the protection and support that we have given to its poor governments, without denouncing them.
We cannot close our eyes this time.
<D>
(HU) The family is the fundamental value of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
We are all obviously aware of the current demographic crisis.
Although there is less mention of it nowadays, its consequences are at least as serious as those of the economic crisis.
Against this background, the occupational safety regulations relating to mothers deserve particular attention.
Nevertheless, the proposed directive divides European public opinion, as it does Parliament.
It is not a good idea to extend the occupational safety regulations which apply exclusively to pregnant women and nursing mothers to fathers as their occupational safety arrangements do not require any change as a result of them becoming fathers.
If we agree to extend the regulation's legal basis to cover Article 137 of the EC Treaty and we extend the scope of the regulation to cover parental leave, two regulations would apply concerning parental leave, including paternity leave as well.
If we asked the social partners to come to an agreement on Directive 96/34/EC on parental leave, which was also mentioned by Commissioner Špidla, why are we trying to prejudge what kind of agreement will be reached?
In some countries the discrepancy between jurisdiction and practice is so great that the task of amending the directive really requires a huge amount of attention.
It would not be appropriate if Parliament waded into the discussion like a bull in a china shop.
A poorly drafted protection regulation may, in some circumstances, go against employing young women since the cost of employing them would become more expensive than employing their male colleagues.
<D>
Mr President, this is the worst crisis since 1929 and it is getting worse: unemployment is in free fall now.
What I said to the President of the Commission a couple of months ago was: 'Please do not oversell what the European Council decided in December 2008.
Please do not paint too rosy a picture of Europe.'
However, that is exactly what you are doing.
You have not made a financial stimulus of 3.3% in Europe - you have not!
When you talk about automatic stabilisers, it is already in the prognosis.
According to the Commission in January, the prognosis is -2%; now the European Central Bank tells us it is -3%.
When you talk about a financial stimulus of 1.5%, it is not 1.5%, because, according to the Bruegel Institute, it will be 0.9%, which is documented.
Now we have the following situation: we are not taking care of employment, unemployment is in free fall, and your stimulus in Europe is not 3.3% but 0.9%.
If you are now telling us to wait for better times and if you agree with Jean-Claude Juncker, who said yesterday that we have done enough, then I say: you have not done enough - people expect more from Europe than you are saying today.
My point is the following: in a few weeks, you will meet Mr Obama, the new President of the United States.
He is coming with an investment package of 1.8% to his gross national product.
We are coming with less than half.
How could you imagine that Europe would put itself in a position where we are the ones who are doing less than our American friends, and where we are the ones who are demanding more of our American friends?
How could you imagine respect for the European Union?
What I am saying is that we need to do more and we need to devise a comprehensive plan, which will cover the summit on 19 March - which is nine days from now - the summit in London, on 2 April, the summit on employment in May in Prague and the June summit.
I appeal to you, President of the Commission, to make a comprehensive, new recovery effort.
If we do not do that, we will lose.
It is not about getting better times next year: this is a fundamental world crisis that we need to take seriously.
My final point concerns solidarity.
The time has come not to accept new demarcation lines between those who have been members of the European Union for many years and those who came to the European Union with a promise that this would be a better time for ordinary people.
Let us now avoid new economic demarcation lines between the new ones and the old ones.
Let us show solidarity in real terms.
That is why I ask you, President of the Commission, to consider new financial possibilities to help our new friends - Eurobonds is one possibility, the European Investment Bank is another.
Please, take it seriously and let us not do too little too late, like they did in Japan, but let us show that Europe is about people, Europe is about showing solidarity with the weakest countries in this Union.
<D>
(PL) Madam President, Commissioner, the situation facing Polish shipyards today certainly requires immediate action on the part of the government, the entire shipbuilding sector and the European Commission.
Instead of privatising the shipyards, they should be nationalised with a view to implementing a comprehensive restructuring programme.
What sense is there in granting any sort of assistance, if the only solution is privatisation, and the shipyards are to be owned by entities from outside the European Union?
That would not only interfere with EU competition rules, but would also involve the loss of a strategic sector of the Polish economy, as more than 100 000 people are currently employed in shipbuilding and in related industries.
Against the background of the global economic crisis, the support recently offered to banks will, de facto, lead to their nationalisation and bring them under state control.
State aid is granted in order to make a business profitable through restructuring.
Such action, for example, could save the Polish shipyard industry.
Since 2005, the European Commission has been asking what the public state aid granted to Polish shipyards has been spent on.
It would be good if the Commission applied equivalent criteria to similar activities carried out by shipyards in other parts of the European Union.
Instead of closing down shipyards without carefully considering such a step, Poland should call those responsible for the improper management of these companies to account, starting with the management and ending with the central administration.
The people responsible for making the wrong decisions in relation to the shipyards should be identified, rather than punishing Polish taxpayers, whose contributions will fund the state aid granted.
I turn to you, Madam Commissioner, to ask you to act judiciously.
We need time to take appropriate and effective action.
I am sure this time will not be wasted.
(Applause)
<D>
Mr President, can I say to the President-in-Office that it is very nice of her to put the ball rolling onto the playing field, but can I suggest that she take it back and put it in the box?
Because, in my view, we really do not need this directive.
I think the previous Council had it absolutely right when they said they did not want it.
I echo very much the words of Jan Mulder that we do already have the Nitrates Directive and the Groundwater Directive.
All these things are beginning to take action on the soil and making sure we are cleaning up our soils throughout the European Union.
I agree with Graefe zu Baringdorf that the farmers are indeed the custodians of the soil and that soil is so important for everything we grow, but do we actually need a soil directive?
The problem with this soil directive is that it has been far too all-encompassing.
We are trying to deal with industrial land and industrial pollution; we are talking about urban development and then about agricultural land and agricultural soils.
It is just nonsense to actually bring in legislation like this at this stage.
I think one of the problems we have here in the European Union - and I think we do it out of the very best of intentions - is that if we need to do something, we immediately legislate.
I do not think so.
I think we have to pause for a moment and reflect.
I think the Council got it right.
I suggest that it is not time to bring this back.
I would suggest that it goes back to a new Commission and the new Council in the next parliamentary session.
They can look again to see what is happening.
I would encourage Member States that do not have controls over the use of industrial land and over pollution from industry to actually put those in place at the national level.
Let us not interfere from the European level because I do not believe we need it.
I think we want to make sure that we do not have the level of bureaucracy that we are getting.
People are absolutely fed up to their back teeth with further bureaucracy.
So I would say to the President-in-Office: please do not set the ball rolling; take it back again.
<D>
(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first I should like to congratulate the Commission on the work it has carried out with the social partners for the revision of the European Works Council Directive.
I think, however, that the gulf between European rhetoric and the practical realities of peoples' daily lives has been instrumental in undermining trust between management and workers.
It has become crucial to boost the level of trust between the two sides of industry in order to increase competitiveness and solidarity in the European Union.
The levels of trust will increase as social dialogue is stepped up and the more social dialogue is stepped up, the more transparency there will be in decisions made over adjustment or restructuring processes.
By improving information flows between employers and workers we shall be contributing towards a better understanding of the impact of international phenomena as well as helping both sides to agree to seek solutions for restructuring processes.
That is why we need to review and modernise the legal mechanisms relating to worker consultation and participation in order to obtain a legal framework which promotes the articulation of social dialogue.
I therefore call upon the European Trade Union Confederation to reconsider their position and sit down at the negotiating table in order to examine this draft directive, along with employers' representatives.
If that turns out not to be possible, I shall be sorry, but I must say also that the Commission must assume its responsibilities and it would be a good thing if the process of revision of this directive were completed during the term of office of this Parliament and this Commission.
<D>
It is essential that we continue to support the coal industry in Europe to allow uncompetitive mines to be closed down gradually.
However, the Commission's proposal does not go far enough.
Mining is concentrated in only a few regions which will have to completely restructure their economies over the next few years.
We have seen often enough in the past that mining regions which have become uncompetitive have suffered a severe social and economic decline within a short period of time.
Previously, many of these regions were the 'black pearls' of economic performance in Europe.
If we give them the time to adjust to the change in circumstances, they can continue to be economic powerhouses.
However, if we leave them in the lurch, we will incur considerable costs as a result of unemployment and bankruptcies.
The argument put forward by the Greens that this process is harmful to the environment is pure invention.
Domestic coal is much more environmentally friendly than imported coal.
For this reason, I have voted in favour of this report, which is very clearly worded.
<D>
(HU) Thank you, Mr President.
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Mrs Jeggle on her excellent report and all the hard work that went into it.
There is no doubt that the European Union needs to respond appropriately to the growing global demand that is prompting a significant increase in the milk quota.
The proposed 2% quota increase, scheduled to take effect in every Member State at the beginning of April 2008, will perhaps help this sector within the European Union to take advantage of the opportunity offered by global demand.
Nevertheless, we need to resolve the issue of milk quotas without creating another problem in the process.
I would like to emphasise that as well as meeting genuine market demand and expanding the range of products on offer, we must help to improve the already difficult situation of producers.
This is why we must ensure that appropriate weight is given to the social and environmental impact of the quota increase, and its impact on production, especially as regards supporting producers in less favoured regions.
Ensuring that the price is appropriate for producers and consumers alike is indispensible for internal market mechanisms.
In view of the fact that the quota system will be abolished after 2015, we must start to think now about how to help producers make their businesses efficient and profitable.
Thank you for your attention.
<D>
Madam President, I, too, would like to thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteur, and in particular Mr Titley and the Commission, for this sound proposal.
My thanks to the Czech Presidency, on the other hand, are somewhat more ambivalent.
I have to say that we were put under heavy pressure by the Council in this trialogue and that the Council showed little ambition.
Quite the opposite, in fact, in that the Council warned us in advance against setting our demands too high so as not to jeopardise the manufacturers in these times of economic crisis.
I see this completely differently, and I think that the majority in this Chamber does too - particularly in times of economic crisis, what we need is clear standards and for the European industry to be motivated and given incentives to set its standards high and develop models for the future, and not for the current situation.
Energy efficiency and CO2 emissions clearly play a very important role in this.
The issue of safety is clearly also important, while the issue of minimising noise, which was given short shrift in this debate, must also not be overlooked, as more and more people are falling ill as a result of noise, with the attendant high costs for society.
For that reason, it is also important that this regulation should be in line with relevant standards.
Overall, we have achieved a good compromise.
We did not sign the first reading agreement as we were critical of the procedure and also of the pressure from the Czech Presidency, but we can live with this compromise, and we, as a group, will be voting for it.
<D>
Mr President, I welcome this report, with just one or two small reservations.
We have heard from my colleague, Mrs Gill, how important small businesses are to the economy and how they are bearing the brunt of the difficulties at the moment.
The trouble is that the European Union is geared entirely for big businesses, whether it is about legislation, access to markets or funding.
We often talk about better regulation, but what we really need is proportionality.
We have to ensure that our legislation is proportional to the problems we are dealing with, and particularly in the IPPC, which we have talked about today.
It is really about big business, not about small businesses, and we should reflect that.
I welcome initiatives like JASMINE, which I think are moving us in the right direction, but we need to think in terms of funding, market access and legislation and about the specific needs of small business.
Let me make one particular plea: we have a single market but we do not have a single Community patent.
We have been at this for years and years now, and it really is a disgrace that we cannot sort out this problem.
It could, by itself, be the biggest help for businesses in the European Union.
Let us have some action.
<D>
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, the South Caucasus is a region of utmost importance, not only for the European Union, but for most of the global players.
I believe that the European Union should define its interests in the region.
Basically, those interests consist in having a peaceful and stable place in the South Caucasus, in having a large enough free and integrated market, in having an open area for the safe transit of strategic merchandise, and in having institutions and legislation that are interoperable with European Union ones.
In order to promote our interest, the European Union should develop appropriate nuanced and specific bilateral relations with the Member States of the region.
The substance of the bilateral relations should result from our regional strategic approach, and not the other way round.
Since we cannot offer the South Caucasus countries European Union membership, we must offer them the European Union model and assist them, in a substantial way, to enhance it.
The European Union should not hesitate to use all its means in order to reach its regional goals in South Caucasus.
At the same time we must acknowledge that the other international operators have an interest in the region and we have acknowledged the fact that the European Union could not possibly move its priorities without cooperation with the other global actors.
Some of the unsolved conflicts in the area are, in fact, part of a broader coherent problem which is linked to the post-Soviet status of Russia.
Therefore, the European Union should courageously address that problem and try to find a negotiated solution concerning the way in which Russia, the European Union and other global players must share responsibilities for guaranteeing the sustainable regional and global stability and security.
On the other hand, we must admit that principles of territorial integrity and self-determination are clashing in the South Caucasus.
My opinion is that one could overcome this clash of principles by combining regional integration following the European Union communitarian model with an appropriate use of the internal self-determination, devolution and autonomy.
This would require good-faith negotiations, political will, a pragmatic spirit and respect for international law provisions.
It is the right time for the European Union to pass from promises to action in the South Caucasus.
I hope that this will indeed happen.
<D>
My commitment to the protection of the weak and women afflicted by violence compels me to vote in favour of legislation to guarantee the protection of victims of violence.
Women, like children, are particularly fragile members of our society in some contexts.
I therefore think it is important to ensure greater protection to women who claim they have suffered violence.
I am thus in favour of free legal assistance to women who are victims of violence.
I know there is a risk of inequality when men unjustly accused of violence have to pay court costs while their accusers receive legal aid: I have thought about this carefully.
However, I believe that the number of cases of violence, including family violence, should lead us to take the side of those who suffer the most serious damage from lack of support: female victims of violence are statistically a much more dominant share than the few criminals who take advantage of the system to get the better of innocent men.
It is difficult for battered women to file a complaint; free legal assistance would encourage the victims and help reduce the number of incidents that have gone unpunished.
mmigrants.
It is a fact in any case that a large number of migrants are registered in women's refuges.
It is also a fact that we need to put a stop to the pseudo-do-gooder mentality that treats crimes committed with a religious or cultural motive with leniency.
<D>
Madam President, I would like to thank Ms Attwooll for her work and welcome this report as it has initiated a much-needed debate on alternative management measures.
I strongly agree with the report when it points out that the current fisheries management systems within the EU, specifically in the area of TACs and quotas, do not provide an answer to our problems, and that it is necessary to hold a wide-ranging debate.
In its green paper on the reform of the common fisheries policy, the Commission states that: 'Alternative management mechanisms can play a significant complementary role in Community fisheries management.'
However, I would venture to suggest that alternative management measures should and must play a compulsory role in the future, as we need to take on board a range of factors, including climate change and up-to-date marine and fisheries research based on sound science.
As I pointed out in my now redundant opinion of the Committee on Fisheries for the report by the Temporary Committee on Climate Change, I have no doubt that climate change will impact on EU fisheries regulations, as allocations of quotas based on historic catch patterns will need to be revised as a result of the shifting distribution of fish stocks.
Furthermore, fisheries management will have to be increasingly based on adaptive approaches as historical data will be less valuable.
As climate change and other factors increasingly impact on our fish stocks, our management will need the necessary flexibility, based on sound peer-reviewed science, to adapt to the new conditions and ensure sustainability of resources.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, today's debate is very important because we are close to reaching agreement on the climate and energy package.
I would like to thank the Parliament and in particular Mr Turmes, Mrs Niebler, the shadow rapporteurs and the rapporteurs for opinions, for a job very well done.
We have been impressed by the seriousness and the constructive approach of all involved, which have been essential in enabling us to get very close to an agreement.
The latest trialogue on the directive finished at 1.30 this morning.
Very good progress was made and it looks as though very few unresolved issues remain.
This means that we are close to the goal of adopting framework legislation on renewable energy sources that will make a real difference for security of supply, Europe's competitiveness and also for sustainability.
Prospects are extremely good that within the next few days we will be able to confirm our agreement to set a 20% share of renewable energy in the Community in 2020.
We will be able to confirm how this target will be broken down into legally binding targets for Member States that will provide certainty for investments.
We will be able to agree on flexibility and cooperation mechanisms to enable those Member States to achieve their targets by working together in cost-effective ways.
We will be able to agree on a 10% target for renewable energy use in transport and on bonuses towards the targets for second-generation biofuels and for renewables used by electric cars.
We will be able to agree on a world-leading set of sustainability criteria for biofuels used to achieve this target.
We will be able to agree on a whole range of measures to break down administrative barriers to renewable energy penetration and ensure its access to the electricity and energy networks.
Two or three years ago we could not have imagined achieving such a goal.
Really big steps have been taken towards achieving European energy policy objectives.
I mentioned cooperation mechanisms.
It seems that the key unresolved issue in the negotiations is whether there should be some kind of review of these mechanisms in 2014.
The Commission can fully understand Parliament's concerns about such a review, taking into account the fact that one of the fundamental purposes of the directive is to create a clear and certain legal framework for investment.
At the same time, we are aware that the flexibility mechanism provided for in the directive includes some untested elements.
We cannot say for sure that every part of their design is quite perfect.
For that reason we are not opposed as such to a review of the functioning of these mechanisms, but we do not want to question the target.
However, if it is agreed that such a review should take place, I would stress the need to ensure that it should not in any way call into question the targets in the directive or its level of ambition.
I am confident that the institutions will be able to find an appropriate solution to this remaining problem.
Looking at the process as a whole, I am proud - and I believe you should be proud - that the Council and Presidency are working together and have achieved a great deal.
The directive will enable the whole of the Union to reach the standards that so far have been maintained only by a very limited number of Member States.
This is good progress.
It is an important step towards maintaining the EU's pioneering role in the critical task of tackling climate change and leading by example in Copenhagen next year.
In the context of the recently adopted energy security package, this directive also marks an important step forward in our efforts to improve the security of our energy supply.
The development of the Renewable Energy Directive has been a stimulating process of work between the institutions, in which the Parliament has played its full role.
We are nearing the end and it is clear from the consensus that has been achieved that the result will be an excellent one.
I look forward to this process reaching its fulfilment in the coming days.
<D>
in writing. - Russia blocked gas supplies at an extremely inopportune time for European consumers and it is essential that the gas deliveries are restored without further ado.
But, after having resolved the crisis, we must take a long look at our dependency on gas from Russia, and there are two aspects that ought to be considered.
First, Russia must assure its capability of fulfilling its commitments to the EU.
The failure of outdated technology and infrastructure may jeopardise the stable flow of gas to the EU.
It should also be noted that despite ambitious plans on the Nord Stream gas pipeline there is no certainty that the output of Russia's natural gas fields is sufficient for meeting their commitments.
Second, the Kremlin has a history of using economic instruments as political tools.
The European Union should never become a victim of such political behaviour.
I encourage the EU to diversify its energy package to avoid its dependence on one single natural gas provider.
<D>
Mr President, I am delighted to see Commissioner Kuneva here this evening.
I have literally just got off a plane and I was not expecting to speak, but I am delighted to have the opportunity.
I am probably one of the few people in Parliament who was actually at the signing of the Ottawa Convention 10 years ago.
The campaign against anti-personnel landmines is something that I have been very heavily involved in over many years.
So I very much welcome this debate.
I think it is very important that we keep our minds on the real problem.
When we were all at Ottawa 10 years ago, we hoped that this would be a problem that we would really eradicate over the coming 10 years.
Well here we are, 10 years on, and we are still saying more or less the same things that we said 10 years ago, which I think is a great pity.
We have got to get the thing into perspective.
We managed to have that ban on anti-personnel landmines because responsible armed forces recognised that they could take this particular weapon out of their armouries and they were fully behind it.
We have got to be very careful that we keep our armed forces on board in these debates, so trying to widen the ban into all these other areas is sometimes unhelpful - when we talk about anti-tank mines, for example.
These are weapons which we still need, to be used by responsible armed forces in our democracies.
We should always point the finger at the real culprits.
The real culprits are what some people politely term 'armed non-state actors'.
These are actually insurgents and terrorists and these are the people who are making greatest use of these weapons around the world.
If we look at the problem in Afghanistan at this moment: the anti-personnel landmines which are still being laid are being laid by the Taliban in Afghanistan.
These are the people who are causing these problems at the moment.
So we need to direct our attention in the right sort of way.
I very much welcome the debate.
I would like to think that we are putting the right resources into overcoming this problem, and that has my full backing.
<D>
(SK) Fifty years have passed since the first Euroregion emerged along the German-Dutch border.
Since then many other regions have initiated mutual cooperation.
They help each other to solve similar or identical problems that often occur in border regions.
They create new job opportunities and share their culture.
The Regulation establishing a European grouping of territorial cooperation that was approved in July 2006 seems to be a very good tool for regional cooperation and a step in the right direction.
It offers the regions flexibility in cooperation and has a positive influence on the population of the Member States, the economy and the business environment.
More is the pity, then, that the Member States have not transposed this useful Regulation into their legislation in spite of the fact that this should have happened by 1 August 2007.
Many regions are very interested in the European grouping of territorial cooperation because it gives them the opportunity to cooperate with other regions and at the same time offers them a significant level of autonomy in their relationship with governments and central administrations.
It has also a positive effect on the lives of the population in individual regions: one of the aims of regional cooperation is to facilitate more efficient development of human resources and so reach a balance in the development of supply and demand in regional labour markets.
We must not forget either that the EGTC will benefit the business world as well, namely by supporting development of the economy with the aim of improving its productivity and structure, creating new job opportunities and stabilising those that are at risk.
Individual groupings of territorial cooperation will be able actively to promote a rise in employment and social inclusion.
The Regulation simplifies and supports regional cooperation in the Member States of the Union and so facilitates economic and social cohesion.
This is a good thing and for that reason I urge the Council and the Commission to take the necessary steps to ensure implementation of this Regulation in the individual Member States.
<D>
in writing. - (PT) This report has almost 200 articles and includes some aspects we support and others which we do not.
Our vote should be understood in the light of that statement.
However, we should point out that the report fails to address the causes of situations that it sometimes diagnoses.
The report shirks its responsibilities by failing to criticise the EU's neoliberal policies, which underlie the poverty of millions of people, especially children.
These policies lead to deep and unacceptable social inequalities, caused by capitalist exploitation and concentration.
Policies that foster social strife, with the loss of value of workers' wages; easy dismissals and increasingly insecure contractual arrangements; longer and more flexible working hours and the liberalisation and privatisation of public services.
Policies that have profound adverse consequences on the efficiency and living conditions of workers and their families, and hence of their children.
The respect and full exercise of the rights of the child requires, among other things, a fair distribution of wealth, jobs with rights, decent wages, shorter working hours, development of strong public systems of social security, health and universal and free education.
<D>
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (SL) Our European Union was born out of the experience of the Second World War.
We have a common, documented, historical memory which has made it possible for us to build our common European future together.
Srebrenica is horrific testimony to the fact that in 1995 the horrors of the Second World War repeated themselves in Europe in the most appalling way.
Srebrenica is a symbol of ethnic cleansing.
Srebrenica is synonymous with the ruthless and inhumane killing of children and adults - it is synonymous with genocide.
However, Srebrenica also stands for the concealment of killings and the destruction of mass graves.
We have to build Srebrenica into our common historical memory and into the foundations of the European Union's enlargement into the Western Balkans.
We must not tolerate discriminatory and exclusionist stereotypes about individual nations, we must battle with collective guilt.
Those responsible for the genocide in Srebrenica must be brought before the Hague Tribunal, they must stand trial and be sent to prison, and we must work together to build and make possible a European future for Srebrenica, for the local population and for the whole of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The very least we should do is try to empathise with the traumas and torment of those who have to live with a raw memory of a crime, who have to live without their loved ones.
I would like to thank the Conference of Presidents for unanimously supporting the proposal that we invite young Bosniaks and Serbs from Srebrenica to the European Parliament together every year, so that, in a setting away from Srebrenica, without the pressures and stresses of their home surroundings, they can think, plan and build a common and more beautiful future for Srebrenica and for the whole of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
This resolution ...
(The President cut off the speaker.)
<D>
Mr President, there are enormous savings to be had by the creation of a common European grid.
Somewhere in Europe, at any given moment, there is surplus electricity, and breaking down national barriers will substantially reduce our dependence on imported energy sources.
Unfortunately, though, that kind of model of integration - a free-market, decentralised, organic one - is not what we have been voting on in our series of reports today.
We are instead going down this road towards harmonisation, towards fixed prices, towards protection, towards a common negotiating position vis-à-vis Russia and other third parties.
It is a basic ideological difference in the European Union between a free market based on mutual product recognition and a harmonised market based on the reduction of consumer choice, the protection of producers and the regulation of authority.
I think there are particular dangers for a country like Britain.
We were, until two years ago, the EU's only net energy producer.
Even now we are roughly in equilibrium.
A common energy policy could end up being for us like the common fisheries policy, one where we are the only country putting a substantial amount into the common pot, from which all others are then drawing on an equal basis.
<D>
in writing. - In my country, Ireland, residential energy accounted for about 25 % of the total final energy consumption.
A large proportion of this energy accounted for was connected to the consumption of energy for heat.
Energy consumption in the domestic sector is greater than necessary, as people living in inefficient dwellings must consume more energy to heat their homes.
Improving a household's energy efficiency status can often be achieved by taking some relatively simple and inexpensive steps, such as fitting thermostatic valves onto radiators or using more energy efficient household appliances.
Other measures include installation of full central heating systems, or the provision of insulation in cavity walls or lofts.
These latter options can be more disruptive in the short term, but their impact is long lasting.
I would like to call on governments to promote insulation in housing and the other measures that I have mentioned.
In promoting these measures one can save in energy costs whilst helping the environment.
The VAT reduction on renovation should be promoted by governments.
Better insulation would cut the residential energy consumption down by up to 5 %.
<D>
Waste is, after power, industry and agriculture, the fourth largest source of greenhouse gas emissions, the main source of the emissions being landfills.
Landfills represent an enormous threat, not only through the production of methane, but also through the possible contamination of underground water, soil and, of course, the surface of the landfill sites.
Ever greater areas are experiencing irreparable soil degradation here.
Globally, bio-waste is most often put in landfills and only a tiny percentage is sorted and reprocessed.
Up to 100 million tonnes of kitchen waste and garden waste is produced in the European Union each year, and up to 37 million tonnes of waste from the food and drink industry.
However, bio-waste has an important role to play in combating climate change and, if it could be exploited, represents enormous potential for producing renewable energy.
Europeans now understand the need to sort waste.
However, bio-waste almost always ends up in landfills.
In some of the older Member States, it is possible to store bio-waste in containers and to process and make further use of it.
In the new Member States, there is almost no chance of separating bio-waste as well as plastic, glass and paper, because people have nowhere to store it.
It is therefore essential to create conditions for the recycling and further energy generating use of bio-waste in every Member State of the EU.
The report deals with the issue adequately, and I will vote in favour of its adoption.
<D>
President of the Commission. - I would like to thank Graham Watson for this very important question.
In fact, that is the core of the programme for the next five years: to invest more in smart, green growth, sustainable growth.
This is very important.
We have to understand that the model of the future will not be like the model of the past.
I am for a strong industrial base in Europe - but a strong industrial base for the new age of sustainability, where we have to think about green development, green technologies.
That is where we can create new products, new markets.
This is a good example.
That is why we are organising our future programme in terms of what I called, in my political guidelines, 'new sources of growth' because, with the traditional sources of growth, we will not win the battle of competitiveness with big emerging economies like China and India.
So innovation has to be at the core, at the centre of our agenda for growth, new sources of growth promoting the transition to a low-carbon economy: smart green development and innovation.
I think innovation will be key for the development of the European economy in the future.
<D>
(FI) Mr President, our Group considered the amendment regarding the recognition of the role of nuclear power in our declaration on the climate conference to be an essential part of this resolution.
That is why we want to express our satisfaction that Parliament confirmed this by adopting Amendment 7.
We are not alone in our view.
The UN's climate panel, the IPCC, also confirmed the role of nuclear power as a low-emission form of energy.
Perhaps, too, we should remind ourselves that this House took an historic decision in connection with Mr Reul's report, with 509 votes in favour.
The European Parliament recognised that nuclear power was, at the present, the EU's most important energy source with low carbon dioxide emissions, and at the same time highlighted its role in the fight against climate change.
On the other hand, our Group did not support section 25 in the resolution because in our opinion it needlessly linked or compared the peaceful use of nuclear power with the spread of nuclear weapons and the threat of terrorism.
We should remember that there are no moral censors in the atmosphere.
It does not shun one form of energy or sympathise with another for ideological reasons.
Only freedom from emissions has any importance, and now the emissions are not welcome.
In any case, I wish to say we are pleased that this House sent out a clear message for the Climate Conference and recognised the seriousness of the threat of climate change.
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Mr President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, a few months ago, in Annapolis, the Israelis and the Palestinians had a dream: a dream of two nations, each living securely in its own State with internationally recognised borders, after decades of conflict, grieving families and tragedy.
At the Paris conference a few months ago, the international community was willing to back that dream and enable it to become a reality.
Europe, the main international donor, believes in that peaceful and secure future and is making every possible effort, within the Quartet, to help the two parties break the vicious circle of violence and lack of understanding.
However, in just a few days the disproportionate use of force and armed provocation killed dozens of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and several Israeli soldiers in violent confrontations.
Only last Thursday, a Palestinian killed eight students at a prominent religious school and was himself killed.
The bullets of fanatics and individuals motivated by revenge, intolerance and rejection of others have made it even more difficult to seek dialogue, compromise and peace.
The international community and we in Europe cannot and should not set ourselves up as judges of either side.
Our task is to make the Annapolis signatories see reason, in other words bring them to the negotiating table.
The PPE-DE delegation to Jerusalem and Ramallah that I led a few weeks ago taught me three lessons.
The first is the expectation of Europe in the Middle East: not just of a Europe that supports the peace process financially, although that is essential, but of a Europe that makes its presence felt much more and is stronger politically.
We have to take more action and act more effectively.
The second lesson is that we need to encourage moderate parties in Israel and Palestine and give them our political support.
The risky path that these parties have chosen, the path of peace, dialogue and responsibility to their peoples, is often not to their advantage electorally.
It is those parties and moderate figures that we have to encourage as much as possible, because they and only they hold the keys to a peaceful and sustainable solution in the region.
The third point is that Europe has to make both sides realise that they will never be able to escape this vicious circle of security, defence and violence by building walls, killing people with rockets, humiliating the other side.
No, it is only if their neighbours, especially young people, are allowed to build a future, realise their ambitions, develop in their own land, that a virtuous circle can be formed and produce results.
Together with my group, I welcome the recent call by both Israeli and Palestinian leaders for further dialogue, following the Annapolis roadmap.
Europe has to step up its political support.
I stress, its political support for the moderate groups in power.
That is the only way out and yesterday, during the church service, we heard a Palestinian and a Jewish representative call for the same thing, peace for their peoples.
(Applause)
<D>
(PL) Madam President, the European Parliament has stressed the infringement of human rights in China, and the lack of democracy in that country, on many occasions.
These are obvious matters.
Only yesterday, in discussing the European Union's human rights report for the past year, we spoke of the lack of human rights, democracy and the rule of law in China.
On the other hand, it does not seem right to me to ignore the changes for the better that are taking place in China.
In particular, the coming year of the Olympic Games should be used by the European Union to pressurise the Chinese authorities towards liberalisation, democratisation, the rule of law and the release of all political prisoners.
On 20 November a delegation of the European Parliament's Subcommittee on Human Rights to the United Nations Organisation in New York met with Liu Zhenmin, China's representative to the UN.
I consider it to have been a constructive meeting.
The Chinese side showed signs of openness and sensitivity to pressure on human rights and democracy - a fact that was also emphasised by representatives of Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International in talks with the Subcommittee's delegation.
<D>
(SK) I support the view that the introduction of the euro, the gradual enlargement of the euro area and the application of consistent economic policies combined with the cautious approach of the European Central Bank have led to the present relatively stable economic development in the European Union countries.
It is also undisputable that, due to the dynamic growth in the number and variety of financial market operations, these operations are becoming less transparent.
This then results in a growing number of risks that may potentially harm not just supplier and consumer groups but also the economies of entire nations.
Consequently, there is a need to set up a wider EU framework for financial supervision and to involve the European Central Bank more closely in supervision to solve any problems in the financial system.
I agree with the rapporteur, Mr Schmidt, that increased cooperation between central banks and national supervisory authorities will become inevitable.
The goal is to uphold stability in the financial markets, in particular taking into account the increasingly integrated financial systems.
In this day and age, what applies to ecology applies to the financial markets as well.
Without the participation of other big players, such as the US, Russia, Japan, China, India and others, achieving a successful result in the worldwide context will not be possible.
<D>
(PT) In 2006 the European Union recorded its highest economic growth since 2000.
In 2007 the EU grew more than the United States, and some new Member States approached or even broke the two-digit barrier.
For those who claim that the reform of the Lisbon Strategy is neo-liberal and no longer attaches importance to social issues, the answer is clear: in 2006 employment grew three times more than the average over the previous five years, in the last two years over six-and-a-half million new jobs have been created, and another five million are expected by 2009.
Figures like these have not been seen since the 1980s.
What is more, in 2006 European productivity increased more than the annual average for the previous five years, and for the first time in many years, productivity growth in Europe was greater than in the USA.
Although these results cannot be attributed exclusively to the Lisbon Strategy, it cannot be denied that it has contributed to them.
I therefore congratulate the Commission on its coordination of the Lisbon Strategy in very difficult circumstances.
As regards the future, the European economy can continue to grow and more jobs can be created, despite the current economic climate, if in coming years Member States' economic policies are better coordinated, if the internal market is developed further, if social dialogue is promoted, if wage rises accompany growth in productivity, if there is an effective system of financial supervision, if the fifth freedom - knowledge - is boosted, and, very important for me, if the European Union shows clear signs that it wishes to defend its interests, which means, rather than being a passive subject of globalisation, on the contrary showing that it is prepared to play a crucial role in controlling it.
<D>
(PL) Madam President, I have come here not just as a Member of the European Parliament, but also as a person with practical experience of the European School, as I am the father of a child that attended the European School in Brussels for three years and who last year took the baccalaureate.
From family experience, as well as from my occasional observations, for example, at parents' evenings at this, which is one of the four European Schools in Brussels, I feel that I know what we are talking about today.
I wanted to say just one thing: the number of these schools is increasing.
When my son went to this school three years ago, there were three schools in Brussels and now there is a fourth one.
The permitted number of pupils in classes in European Schools is 32.
It is worth noting that in many European countries the permitted number of pupils in a class is considerably lower than in the European Schools.
Our interest in this subject is clear: we have to take an interest in something that, as the European Union, we pay for.
More than 50% of the budgets of these schools comes from European Union funds.
The conclusion, Madam President, is this: it is sensible to open up these schools, but this should not be at the cost of teaching quality or an excessive number of children and young people in these schools.
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the majority of Irish people who voted expressed their opposition to the Lisbon Treaty.
My Group respects that decision just as it also respects that of the 18 Member States that have to date expressed their support for the Treaty and ratified it.
The European Union is founded on freedom of expression and democracy.
Therefore, because we are democrats, we want all of the Member States to express their opinion on the ratification of the Treaty.
It is only at the end of this process that the European Council will be able to decide which path to take; in other words - not to take anything away from Ireland's decision - no Member State should deprive the others of freely expressing their position.
We hope that this week the European Council will carry out a calm, responsible and constructive analysis of the situation ensuing from this vote.
The PPE members of my Group hope that the European Council will ask the Member States that have not yet done so to continue with their ratification procedures as is only fit and proper.
Ladies and gentlemen, the people of Ireland have spoken.
They have voiced their concerns about the purpose of European integration, about the way in which Europe is run, about the future of the agricultural policy, about the WTO negotiations, about the tax policy.
The Irish vote also reflects the fact that many people do not understand the complexity of the European Union, whose relevance is not always evident to them.
It is a manifestation of the question many citizens are asking about the very purpose of European integration.
My motivation and that of my generation - in other words, ensuring peace in our continent - is no longer understood by the younger generations.
The Irish 'no' vote is a plea for a better definition of Europe's goals and a better explanation of the reasons for pursuing further integration.
The European Parliament, which adopts texts that are often difficult to read, must play a full role in this exercise.
By voting 'no', however, did the Irish mean that when it comes to climate and energy, the new food order, personal safety, immigration or foreign policy our countries are self-sufficient and can act on an equal footing with the United States, China, India or Brazil?
I do not think so.
By voting 'no', did the Irish mean that solidarity with the poorest countries, from which they have significantly and rightly benefited in recent decades, is no longer relevant and that the rule from now on is every man for himself?
I do not think so.
Finally, by voting 'no' did the Irish want to turn over a new leaf as far as European integration is concerned and were they expressing a negative opinion on the accession of a country like Croatia?
I do not think so.
The PPE members of my Group firmly believe that the Lisbon Treaty, which was the subject of long negotiations and which was signed by the 27 Member States, is a major step forward in comparison to the Nice Treaty.
It enables Europe to function better and it gives it the tools it needs to be speak with a louder voice on the world stage.
I have only one wish and that is for Europe's period of introspection to come to an end as quickly as possible.
It is time for our countries - if I may use the expression - to stop navel-gazing and work together to overcome the real problems and the real challenges.
These challenges should spur us to action and they also give rise to serious concerns, and sometimes anger, as we will see once again in Brussels on Thursday, among all those who are weakened and handicapped by the current situation.
Mr President-in-Office, my request is that tomorrow in the Council you take account of the real problems, of the welfare of our fellow European citizens, and deal head-on with all of the increases that are worrying our citizens.
In this heated debate, the PPE members of my Group are calling for calm and reason.
We must listen to the Irish, we must learn from their vote and we must treat the people of the other European nations with the same respect.
(Applause)

Mr President, Commissioner, we are changing the subject to discuss contact between the European Union's institutions and its citizens.
These contacts are inadequate.
There is a deep divide between the Union and its citizens, yet Jean Monnet pointed out that the Union was being created for the citizens rather than for countries and governments.
The Union is enlarging and acquiring more citizens, but its institutions have difficulty in establishing contact with the citizens.
This became evident through the painful experience of the French and Dutch 'No' to the Treaty of Lisbon.
It is true, nonetheless, that the Union's institutions are endeavouring to improve their contacts with the citizens.
They are opening up to them, and are clearly recognising the role of civil society.
There is an ever increasing range of Union communication policies in this area.
The new term civil dialogue has even been coined to describe these policies.
More is required, however.
The European Parliament is therefore endeavouring to rise to this challenge, and attempting to create a suitable mechanism for the purpose and promote contacts of this nature between the European Union's institutions and its citizens.
This would resolve the issue of lack of democracy and demonstrate that the citizens also play an important role in the decision-making process within the European Union.
Article 10 of the Treaty of Lisbon states that 'Every citizen shall have the right to participate in the democratic life of the Union.
Decisions shall be taken as openly and as closely as possible to the citizen.'
There is also an additional provision making it possible for one million citizens of the European Union to take a legislative initiative.
Following entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, one million citizens will be able to approach the European Commission and invite it to submit a legislative proposal on a subject of importance to the citizens.
That is why I refer to civil dialogue in this report.
The latter is a dialogue that is not defined in law.
It is essential, however, and I would like it to be guided by the following principles, or rather to guide itself by them.
Firstly, I have introduced the principle of civil society representation into this report.
I would like civil society to be suitably represented at the level of the European Union, that is to say, I would like it to be represented by partners that reflect and represent the interests at issue correctly.
I would like civil dialogue to be a reciprocal, two-sided process.
This means it should not just involve the European Union approaching citizens, and the latter responding.
The Union should also inform citizens when their views have been taken into account and explain what the implications of those views have been.
That is why we also need feedback from the Union to the citizens.
I would like civil dialogue to be based on the principles of clarity and transparency.
We should be governed by clear rules when inviting representatives of society to engage in dialogue with us.
We should systematically publish the list of organisations involved in consultation.
It would be wise for the Union to appoint a contact person responsible for this area, namely dialogue.
It is not easy to establish rules governing this area.
The European Commission already drafted principles for strengthening a culture of consultation and dialogue back in 2002, and I therefore hope it will be prepared to draft the appropriate principles.
These would become common principles for all the institutions.
I should like to add too that the Member States should also be required to promote civil dialogue.
I have been unable to mention every part of this report.
I would, however, like the content to be put to the test at the first available opportunity, namely during the 2009 European election campaign.
I would like us to take advantage of that occasion and take a first step towards contact with European citizens, making them aware of the best the Union has to offer and learning from them what we should be fighting for in this House.
<D>
Mr President, European Ombudsman, ladies and gentlemen - my dear nocturnal colleagues, perhaps we have delayed a little in debating the improvement to the Statute of the European Ombudsman.
However, I think that in the end we are doing so at an appropriate moment, because now that the European Parliament is debating in citizens' rights general, it is confronted with a new treaty on the operation of the EU and with a Charter of Fundamental Rights containing an article specific about the right of citizens to make complaints to the European Citizens' Advocate.
I think it is therefore the right moment to debate the subject of the confidence of citizens in the EU bodies.
Let me remind you that the European Ombudsman is at the service of European citizens to help them combat maladministration.
I should like to add that it is high time for the European Parliament itself to show confidence both in its institutions and in the European Ombudsman.
I think that our debate about the changes started at the initiative of the current Ombudsman contained two misunderstandings, which we managed, I believe, to resolve in committee.
The first related to the subject of competences.
Some people have said that we are giving too many competences to the European Ombudsman, but this is not true.
This report attempts to supplement the existing institutional competences of the European Ombudsman so that he can use them appropriately in all the areas which the rapporteur has spoken about.
The second misunderstanding was over the confidentiality of documents.
This particular report does not state what documents the public has access to.
It refers to the documents which the Ombudsman may see and lays down two clear rules: those documents which are sensitive, according to the regulation, may not be seen by anyone; documents subject to the confidentiality regime must continue to be subject to it.
In conclusion, let me say that in the current circumstances it is very important for us to promote this report.
<D>
Mrs Laperrouze's report refers to an issue that is particularly important to every European citizen, especially during the gas crisis which we faced recently.
We all need to make our contribution to successfully attaining the ambitious objectives which this Second Strategic Energy Review is proposing, namely energy supply sustainability, competitiveness and security.
I want to emphasise the importance of improving the security of our energy resources.
We must take measures to diversify our energy sources and supply routes.
We need to support investments in infrastructure and in new technologies with reduced energy consumption, so that we can successfully achieve the '20-20-20' objectives.
Now more than ever, Member States must demonstrate their solidarity and cooperate in order to ensure the security of their energy reserves.
At the same time, this new strategy needs to lay the foundations for economic growth in the EU.
I would like to remind you of the geopolitical importance of Romania and the Black Sea region for energy security and diversification of energy supply resources.
<D>
in writing. - (RO) In November 2009 Romania had 5.54 million pensioners and 5.65 million contributors to the public pension system.
Providing EU citizens with an adequate, sustainable pension, now and in the future, is a priority for the European Union.
Achieving these objectives in an ageing Europe is a major challenge and Member States must prepare for this by reforming their pension systems.
Member States must improve the adequacy of pensions by combating gender discrimination on the labour market, especially through a 10% reduction in the pay gap by 2020.
The public pension system must be strengthened to the detriment of the private system.
We must not privatise the public pension system simply to ensure the stability of pension funds for current and future pensioners.
Although the trend at European level is to raise the retirement age, it should be applied flexibly according to the sector and the severity of the working conditions, while also taking into account the number of years' service.
Active support is required for job creation.
The quality of work also needs to be improved in order to increase the number of people who will actively contribute to funding their future pensions.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for the excellent work and the very good report that he has produced, and also the other members of the committee who have supported him and worked with him in producing such an interesting, useful and positive report.
I do not want to repeat much of what has been included in the communication or in the report, and I begin by saying that I am very happy that we see eye to eye as to how we can solve and deal with such a difficult and important problem.
We know the statistics, which are worrying.
Almost 200 000 people a year in the European Union die of diseases related to excessive alcohol consumption.
We have 43-45 million people who drink at hazardous levels in the European Union which amounts to 70.4% of all ill health and early deaths, and this is one of the largest causes of death among young people.
So the statistics are worrying, but we have to emphasise from the outset that we are not dealing with alcohol as a product on its own: it is the excessive consumption and the abuse of alcohol that are creating these problems.
Sometimes it makes it more difficult to educate and teach people how to consume, in moderate and more responsible ways, a product which has been around for centuries; it is the excess or the abuse that is causing the problems.
I am very happy that Parliament agrees with the need for a European strategy and for European action in this respect.
It is true that we have to complement the policy of the Member States, as is stated in Article 152, but that does not mean that we do nothing.
On the contrary, we are there to support, complement and add to the actions taken by the Member States.
It is also true that we have different cultures and different traditions in the Member States but, unfortunately, we now see the problems that until recently existed only in some Member States spreading everywhere in the European Union.
Unfortunately, bad habits travel fast and are very easily copied, especially by young people.
The possibility exists to exchange best practice through cooperation and working together, before it is too late.
We can take action before the problem gets out of hand, and this is one of the most important aspects of this strategy.
We should focus on young people.
Binge drinking is now a main concern regarding young people, but drink-driving is also one of the highest causes of deaths among young people.
At the same time, it is extremely important to focus on the priorities, and I am glad that the report agrees with the Commission on the main priorities, as I said, especially regarding young people, but also pregnant women.
Unfortunately, it is still a problem in the European Union that we still have children born with problems because of alcohol consumption during pregnancy.
One would have expected, in this day and age, with the highest level of education in the European Union, this would not happen, but unfortunately it does.
I have noted with great interest the reference made in the report to the problem among elderly people.
This will be seriously taken into consideration for the next actions because I can see that this can also be a serious social and health problem.
The European Union as a whole will work on two levels.
Firstly, there is the Committee on National Policy and Action, where the Member States are represented, and this will coordinate national alcohol policies and develop further policies, especially those identified in the communication.
But, at the same time, we also have the European Alcohol and Health Forum, where all the stakeholders are present and there we will develop concrete actions at the appropriate levels.
However, it will not be a debating society or just a 'talk show'.
On the contrary, we are asking for firm commitments which will not only have to produce specific results but also will have to be made public and closely monitored, and the results of the monitoring will also be made public.
We are optimistic that this will be able to deal with some complicated issues, for example responsible marketing, responsible advertising - as identified in the report - and, at the same time, other aspects, like responsible serving, because it is not just the producers but also the retailers who have a serious responsibility in this area, and we will focus on this as well.
Most of the issues raised in the report confirm the policy orientations set out in the strategy outlined in the Commission's communication.
Some points strive to further develop this strategy and, of course, I will pay close attention to these; other points go beyond the recommendations of the Commission's communication on some issues, such as labelling and taxation.
We will reflect on these issues as well.
Concerning the warning labels on alcoholic drinks, which I know has been an issue of great debate both when the communication was being drafted and in Parliament as well, we will study the experience obtained by Member States which are already in the process of introducing them and we will explore the possibility, in cooperation with the Member States, of developing official common approaches throughout the Community regarding this issue.
We have evidence that warning labels raise awareness - and that is why Member States introduced them - but, at the same time, they have to be part of a broader strategy; on their own, they cannot achieve the goals we wish for.
Therefore, we need campaigns for raising awareness of education programmes.
For example, we can put warning labels on bottles, but what happens to drinks served in restaurants, bars and homes where the consumer does not see the bottle and, therefore, does not see the label?
So we have to come up with new ideas, for example leaflets accompanying purchases of alcoholic beverages and advice from doctors, as was mentioned in the report.
These are important aspects.
Responsible communication, responsible sales and responsible marketing are also important aspects, and we have what is provided in the audiovisual services legislation.
However, through the forum, we can develop a code of conduct to be complied with by all stakeholders.
I should like to finish by saying that addressing alcoholic-related harm is a difficult challenge, precisely because we have to deal with one particular aspect, the excessive consumption and not the product itself.
However, I believe we are moving in the right direction, before the problem becomes unmanageable.
So I am looking forward to achieving concrete results, in the bodies I mentioned earlier, but, most importantly, in close cooperation with Parliament, and I am looking forward to your support in this continuous effort.
<D>
in writing. - (SV) The June List accepts the Commission's proposals and the European Parliament's amendments, provided the EU institutions respect the principle that education policy is a national matter.
However, in Amendment 7 the Committee on Culture and Education of the European Parliament proposes that a reference should also be included to the 'Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union'.
There is no such thing.
The EU Member States have not adopted any such charter.
There was a reference to such a document in the draft Constitutional Treaty, which was rejected through the democratic process in the summer of 2005.
On the other hand, all the EU Member States have signed the Council of Europe European Convention on Human Rights.
This means that all EU citizens can assert their fundamental freedoms and rights in the European Court of Human Rights.
The EU charter represents the opposite of the 'leaner but keener' EU which is often mentioned in solemn speeches about subsidiarity.
The EU should concentrate on cross-border matters, but stay away from matters on which the individual Member States can take their own decisions or which are already regulated in other international treaties.
It follows that the proposal for an EU Charter of Fundamental Rights should be rejected, of course along with the 'new' Treaty for the EU.
<D>
- (PL) Mr President, Robert Gwiazdowski, an expert at the Adam Smith Institute, is on record as having written that Monty Kaczyński's Flying Circus had flown back from Brussels but that it was not at all clear why it had flown there in the first place.
The cost to Polish taxpayers of getting their President to Brussels was around EUR 45 000.
I should like to put the following question to you, President.
Why did you allow a politician who was not a member of the Polish government's delegation into the debates?
Nobody really knows what that person was doing there.
Furthermore, Mr Kaczyński has gained considerable support from extremist groupings in Poland.
The groupings concerned could even be described as fanatic.
In addition, so far as I am aware, Mr Kaczyński can only speak Polish.
He is incapable of expressing his ideas in any foreign language.
I would therefore be most interested to know how you managed to converse with him, Mr President.
Could you please explain to the House what exactly Mr Lech Kaczyński was doing at the European Council Summit and what you discussed with him in person?
<D>
in writing. - (FR) The enlargement of the European Union calls for our solidarity with the population of the 431 000 km2 around the Black Sea.
This solidarity is expressed by the agreement to open negotiations with Turkey, the implementation of the Neighbourhood Policy with Georgia and Ukraine, and the strategic partnership established with Russia.
The violence of the storm makes us think about the effects of climate change, in our own neighbourhood too.
A risk management policy is required that combines both prevention and the protection of biodiversity.
We remember that the storm trapped four vessels and caused the death of eight sailors.
A Russian cargo vessel also broke in two, releasing 4 000 tonnes of fuel oil on a migration route for diving birds coming from Siberia.
The European Union sent a team within the framework of the Monitoring and Information Centre.
More should be done as part of this initiative.
To prevent future disasters, the EU must make sure that high safety standards are systematically applied to the fleet of Russian vessels.
The EU must impose the use of double-hull cargo vessels on its Russian partner, for transporting oil.
As the parliamentary assembly of the BSEC meets, we should be demanding the application of the standards in the European maritime safety package.
<D>
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Czech Presidency, the Commission, Mrs Niebler, as the Chairman of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, my fellow rapporteurs on this energy package, the shadow rapporteurs and the committee's secretariat, including all its officials, for their cooperation and for the skill they have displayed in working on this issue.
We all can and should be proud of the result we have achieved; I certainly am, thinking about the work I did when I inherited the directive on the internal market in gas, with problems that had no easy solutions.
I am happy that this, my second term of office as an MEP, has coincided with the concluding stage of this package, which I believe to be one of the most important matters dealt with in this term of office, and one which will benefit our electorate, the citizens of Europe.
The Gas Directive that will enter into force from 2011 brings in significant innovations in the sector: one important result that should be emphasised is that the ITO option has been achieved.
This will open up the markets and ensure that real progress is made towards a system that will genuinely allow the European Union to speak with one voice on energy issues.
The ITO system is the true innovation in this package and it is the area where the European Parliament can be said to have achieved the best outcome.
The new Gas Directive attributes much importance to the gas authorities and to the agency.
The directive gives legitimacy to the authorities in their role, particularly in those countries where they are to start their activities from scratch.
It is therefore a matter of fundamental importance that we have designated the role and responsibilities of these bodies, and have given them broad powers, since the authorities have the difficult task of controlling the common energy market.
Another detail, which was added in at the trialogue stage, is the exemption from the common rules for so-called 'closed' systems, such as airports, hospitals, stations, industrial sites, and so on, which because of their specific individual features are subject to a more favourable system.
This is an example of the attention paid by the new directive to the needs of European citizens.
In my view, it is, in fact, European citizens that will really benefit from this directive, since with the use of smart meters they will have access to all the information relating to their bills and will be able to assess the best offer on the market and to choose their supplier on the basis of the best price, because while it is true that it will take some years to see the effects of this liberalisation, nonetheless it cannot be denied that the entry of new operators onto the market will lead to a fall in prices and to more favourable market conditions for EU citizens.
Another important element is the recognition of European transmission network systems that will provide gas supply security to European citizens.
All this also hinges on the strengthening and creation of new infrastructure such as regasification facilities and storage facilities, which will be the driving force behind the third package.
What is required, therefore, is the opening up of a competitive market, ensuring long-term investment and contracts from firms in the sector, particularly in the new Member States, where the creation of new infrastructure would also make it possible to resolve long-standing problems relating to energy dependence.
The protection of more vulnerable consumers has been taken into account, by giving the national and regional authorities the option to guarantee their gas supplies at the most critical times.
The successful outcome on this Gas Directive and the energy package as a whole once more highlights the role of Europe and its institutions in acting for European citizens.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, the topic we are debating this evening has already been on the European Parliament's agenda many times.
It is well-known that, in its granting of aid, the Commission is guided by the conditions of the International Monetary Fund.
That has been said a couple of times already.
Against this background, questions have repeatedly been put to the Commission by the European Parliament.
In November 2008, the European Parliament called on the Commission to present an analysis of the effects of the behaviour of banks that, at that time, had transferred their assets out of those Member States that had recently acceded to the EU.
On 24 April of this year, the European Parliament repeated this request.
It also requested to be brought up to speed about the declarations of intent between the Commission and the Member States receiving aid in which the conditions for the aid are laid out in detail.
As far as I know, there has, as yet, been no response to these requests.
Thus, my first question is this: is it correct that these requests have, as yet, not been answered?
If so, then my second question is: why have these requests not yet been answered?
My third question is therefore: when can we expect an answer to these requests?
<D>
President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Mr Evans, I am glad you are here because I am not quite sure what this question means.
Perhaps I have not understood it properly and you will be able to clarify it.
There are, in South America, certain outermost regions that form an integral part of the European Union and are, by that token, eligible for specific policies.
There is not, however, any South American state as such that is a member of the European Union - I am being very cautious here for perhaps I did not understand all the nuances of the question.
As for Turkey and Croatia, there has been notable progress since we opened negotiations with those countries.
In the case of Turkey, for example, the screening process, which is the first formal step for each chapter, has been completed for 23 chapters; eight chapters have been opened to negotiation, and for one of them the process is provisionally closed.
Our presidency believes it will be able to open two further chapters.
In the case of Croatia, the screening has concluded.
Twenty-one chapters were opened, of which three are provisionally closed.
There was an accession conference on 25 July this year and the first, rather sensitive chapter on the movement of goods was opened and Chapter 20, on enterprise and industrial policy, was closed.
As you know, progress with the negotiations depends mainly on the results achieved by the candidate countries.
The progress made in meeting the criteria for opening and closing chapters, as well as the requirements set out in the framework of the negotiations, including the revised accession partnerships, are crucial in this respect and we obviously refer to the Commission's judgment.
Let me repeat, Mr Evans, that if my reply has been a bit off-centre, I would be very happy if you could tell me exactly what you meant by your question.
<D>
in writing. - (PL) I voted in favour of the report on amendments to Rule 121 of the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament concerning proceedings before the European Court of Justice.
I did so because the issue in question is an example of respect for the rule of law.
Rule 121(3) of the Rules of Procedure states that the President shall bring an action before the Court of Justice on behalf of Parliament and in accordance with the recommendation of the committee responsible.
This provision refers explicitly and exclusively to complaints before the Court.
In such cases it is not possible to apply a broader interpretation according to which this provision could be applied to other cases of a different nature before the Court.
The provision is only implemented in cases involving the filing of a complaint (on repeal of a legal act, for instance) when Parliament initiates court proceedings.
In the interests of ensuring legal certainty and completeness, the rapporteur rightly proposed the addition of a new paragraph to Rule 121.
The new paragraph would enshrine the established practice regarding the submission of comments by the President of the European Parliament to the Court and his or her appearances before the Court at the request of the Committee on Legal Affairs.
The proposed amendment establishes a procedure to be followed should a difference of opinion emerge between the President and the relevant committee.
Thanks to this amendment, the procedure currently being followed will have a democratic legal basis.
<D>
Europe now needs, and will need in the future, both a more and less trained workforce from beyond the borders of the EU.
For the EU to be able to compete with the United States of America for trained and educated immigrants, the Union needs to become a more attractive prospect.
Facilitating the mobility of workers from outside is a step in the right direction for the EU, and so I would like to thank Mrs Klamt for her commendable report.
The Blue Card would enhance the mobility of trained workers from third countries in the EU.
Making the EU a more enticing place to work in should not be allowed to happen, however, at the expense of developing countries.
Unfortunately, the brain drain often takes the skills and know-how needed for development away from those countries, and when the EU makes the new rules, it should take this problem clearly into account.
There also needs to be active continued development of higher education in Europe, however, even if it is easy to acquire trained and educated people from elsewhere.
The new rules for immigrants must not result in any significant inequality between third country and EU nationals.
Parliament's strict definitions of a professional workforce will create a scenario of inequality if unreasonable demands are made of those coming in from third countries in terms of their educational and employment background.
The dearth of labour is threatening the European Union as a whole, and not just in the highly trained sectors.
The EU should therefore extend the scheme for facilitating the movement of a workforce from third countries to the entire spectrum of workers, instead of skimming the cream off the top of the cake.
<D>
I agreed with the report and the rapporteur's proposal to accept without amendment the Council's position on Draft amending budget 1/2011, because financial assistance to these countries, i.e. Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Croatia and Romania, has to be delivered and cannot be delayed further.
een circumstances', as defined in the Financial Regulation, and therefore, in our view, this procedure is both justified and necessary.
The amount mobilised in support of these countries - EUR 182.4 million - represents only about 3% of the total damage, which is estimated at about EUR 5 512.7 million.
The Member States of the EU have been hard hit by a considerable number of disasters in recent years.
In the first six years of the EUSF, the Commission received 62 requests for financial support from 21 different countries.
About a third of these qualified as 'major natural disasters', as do four of the cases that we are considering here today.
The EUSF is an important instrument for helping to remedy the almost always considerable and often long-lasting impact of disasters on people, the environment and the economy.
A commitment to prevention is also important.
<D>
Madam President, today's vote was an important moment for citizens fighting for their rights, their European rights.
National governments at times abandon their citizens and reject their legitimate claims.
Through petitions European citizens can raise their voice, can hold their government accountable.
Ultimately they can have the justice they deserve.
But this is not an important moment only for the European people: it is a crucial time for the European Parliament too.
Today the European Parliament, by voting in favour of the Hammerstein report, shows its commitment to defend and protect European citizens.
Today the European Parliament has the opportunity to regain at least part of the confidence and trust that some in Europe have lost.
Many of our fellow citizens have worked hard to be in the EU, but membership is not only about duties - it is also about rights.
We are here today to show our commitment to the Europe which our citizens expect from us.
<D>
Madam President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his work to date on this matter.
It is now clear that over 125 000 people have died as a result of the cyclone which hit the southern regions of Burma on 2 and 3 May.
The United Nations estimates that in excess of 2.4 million people have been directly affected by this tragedy.
Many are severely injured and it is likely that there will be an outbreak of disease due to lack of food and clean water.
It may already have taken hold in the area.
The policies of the military junta in preventing humanitarian aid workers from getting access to the affected areas are unprecedented.
These aid workers and the agencies that they work for have the expertise to put in place a comprehensive relief operation which would bring assistance to a large number of people in a short period of time.
Will another similar number have to die before the military regime allows the aid agencies in?
The combined efforts of the EU, China, India, all of the South-East Asian nations and the UN have the power to force the Burmese authorities to remove the restrictions.
It is by working together that we can change the mindset of this corrupt government.
In particular we must bring China and India on board to force the change.
It is now 18 days since the cyclone hit the region.
The international community must continue to work so that every person affected by the disaster receives food, clean water, the necessary medical care and shelter.
Let us continue to keep the pressure on the Burmese leadership and force them to allow the international aid agencies to carry out their work.
Let each country within the EU, and the EU itself, continue to apply diplomatic pressure.
This is where immediate action is required.
We must not allow another 18 days to pass before action is taken.
The time for removing the restrictions is now.
<D>
rapporteur. - (NL) Madam President, closing the hole in the ozone layer is important for the environment and for the public health of the population of the whole world.
Our atmosphere is formed in such a way that there are two different layers that protect us.
The CO2 in the tropospheric layer holds in the warmth so that we do not get too cold.
The ozone in the stratospheric layer protects us from harmful UV radiation from the sun.
The regulation on substances that deplete the ozone layer is primarily aimed at protecting the stratospheric ozone layer, but also at preventing climate change.
Thus, those substances that are being prohibited act both to deplete the ozone and to increase global warming.
The predominant substances that deplete the ozone layer are found in aerosol propellants, refrigerators, insulating materials and certain specific solvents and cleaning agents.
The CFCs and halons that have the strongest ozone-depleting effect have been completely eliminated, save for a limited number of exceptions.
It is already prohibited to produce HCFCs, and their use will be banned from 2020.
The preamble to the new regulation states that the production and use of ozone-depleting substances is to be ended or minimised as far as possible.
This is an important policy basis.
Sixty-four amendments were adopted in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
There were then two trialogues, which resulted in an agreement between the Council and Parliament.
This meant that the 64 amendments were replaced by a single, consolidated text.
I would like to briefly mention nine important results of that agreement.
First of all, the legal basis for the regulation has been changed to the environment.
That allows the Member States the possibility of adopting more far-reaching measures to protect the environment.
Secondly, the use of the pesticide methyl bromide will be prohibited as of 18 March 2010.
This also applies to the gassing of containers to control vermin.
The only remaining exception will be for emergencies, such as where a large-scale epidemic occurs.
The third point is that, in the phasing-out programme for HCFCs, the percentage with respect to 1997 has been cut back to 7% for the final years.
Fourthly, HCFCs may only be used in government-designated businesses.
Fifthly, some new substances have been added to the list of substances that are nominated for restrictive measures.
The European Commission has undertaken to investigate these substances further.
Point six is that, for the necessary exceptions, such as for use as reagents and for laboratory use, labelling is being laid down as a mandatory requirement.
It has also been agreed, in this regard, that there must be no increase in laboratory use.
Point seven is that the reuse and recycling of ozone-depleting substances for existing apparatus may only take place within one business.
In addition, a log must be kept of the quantities present in order to prevent fraud and illegal trade.
The eighth point is that attention is being given to enforcement by means of inspections.
In that way, Member States are obliged to work together to tackle illegal trade.
The final point is that, in order to prevent leaks of ozone-depleting substances, the monitoring and enforcement system is to be tightened up.
There is, however, more to be done in order to tackle the problem of stored ozone-depleting substances.
The Commission has an important job here.
I would like to urge it once again to develop the directive on construction and demolition waste along the lines we agreed seven years ago in the Sixth Environmental Action Programme.
All in all, we have achieved a satisfactory result.
The ozone layer will get a better chance to recover so as to reduce the harmful effects, such as skin cancer and damage to plants and trees.

on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PT) Security Council Resolution 1778, which was adopted yesterday, determines that the situation in the region of the border between Sudan, Chad and the Central African Republic constitutes a threat to international peace and security.
This Parliament's motion for a resolution recognises the urgency of the situation and the European Union's responsibility to provide protection.
An overwhelming majority of Members in this House agree with the humanitarian NGOs on the ground, with the refugees in the region who are living in miserable conditions and in a climate of permanent fear, and with the Secretary-General of the United Nations.
All cite the urgent need for an international presence in that region, which must include a strong military component.
There is no country or multilateral organisation that is better suited than the European Union to effectively fulfil the mandate given by Resolution 1778.
The ESDP (European Security and Defence Policy) has come of age and exists for these very emergencies.
In this context, as regards sending an EU military force to the region, the Council and the Portuguese Presidency can count on the support in principle of Parliament.
However, the European Parliament must express its concern about certain aspects of this mission.
Firstly, we fear that the reluctance of Member States to provide the force with the minimum personnel and military equipment needed will greatly reduce its effectiveness.
We would add that the smaller the contributions of the other Member States, the more noticeable the French component of the force will be.
However, the perception of this mission's impartiality is fundamental to its success and France is not regarded as a neutral player in the region.
Secondly, Parliament asks that this force be accompanied by a diplomatic offensive in the region in order to move forward the national reconciliation processes within Chad and the Central African Republic.
The roots of the instability, although linked to the drama in Darfur, are also domestic and can only be overcome through internal political processes.
As stated by Parliament's motion for a resolution, without a genuine political reconciliation process in the region, the European Union operation, planned to last only 12 months, cannot sustainably contribute to peace in the region.
Finally, this Parliament welcomes the mandate of the force which will act under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations.
It is essential that this mandate is correctly interpreted on the ground and that the European troops are proactive in protecting civilians in danger, creating a humanitarian area for the international organisations and protecting the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic and Chad (MINURCAT).
Recent history is full of tragic examples, from Kigali to Srebrenica, of defenceless civilian populations paying the ultimate price for the timidity and overscrupulousness of international troops.
We hope that one day this operation will be used as a model example of the ESDP and effective multilateralism in action and as due evidence of the European Union's desire to strengthen the United Nations and contribute to conflict resolution in accordance with international law and the responsibility to protect enshrined therein.
<D>
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, let us be frank and open: as Frontex is a coordinating agency, we cannot expect it to stop the influx of irregular migrants in itself and of itself, nor to put an end to the trafficking in human beings.
Frontex is not, and never will be, a panacea to all the problems caused by irregular migration.
At the very end it is simple: EU border security is the ultimate responsibility of all Member States, and border controls must be operated in a spirit of sharing responsibilities and solidarity between Member States.
Over the past years, we have been facing a genuine paradox.
One could hear Member States inviting Frontex to stop the flow of irregular migrants immediately and to deploy as much equipment as possible.
However, the centralised record of available technical equipment, as you know, is just a virtual record.
The assets on this list belong to the Member States and they are subject to their will to deploy them.
Clearly, we could debate the will of a number of Member States.
As for the financial perspective, if Frontex were to deploy all the equipment at once, its budget would evaporate immediately.
Therefore, the main question still to be answered - and I am addressing the Council - is whether the Council is ready to extend the principle of compulsory solidarity, obliging all Member States to deliver, i.e. a mandatory solidarity mechanism.
Over the past years, Member States have repeatedly reaffirmed the importance of ensuring full respect for international human rights obligations in managing migration.
Member States underlined the importance of European solidarity in burden-sharing as the founding principles.
Yet, too often, effective decision-making is hamstrung by the inability of these Member States to work together in their mutual interest.
Would the President-in-Office agree that the time for words is passed and the time for action has come?
Would you not agree that in a world marked by increasing regional conflicts and a growing gap between rich and poor, mobility will increase rather than diminish?
Is it not high time that the Member States put themselves in a position to respond to that challenge with a radical, yet responsible, revision of their views on what is supposed to be a comprehensive package on a common - and I repeat, common - migration policy?
Unfortunately, I have to leave the Chamber now, as I am taking part in the ongoing high-level trialogue on the Return Directive.
However, I look forward to receiving your detailed reply at your earliest convenience.
<D>
President-in-Office of the Council. - Thank you for your question.
I cannot agree that the Council is passive when it comes to migration.
On the contrary, recently, especially last year, the Council paid a lot of attention to migration.
I should also mention that the European Council plans to debate the issue of migration at its December session this year.
That means it will be discussed at the highest political level.
The problem of migration is a real problem for the European Union.
I have already mentioned the solutions and indicated the direction in which we should be looking to find them.
More precisely, I could mention the further strengthening of FRONTEX.
That is also one of the areas in which the Council is engaged.
It is important to address demand for migration.
We must manage migration flows better and reduce the brain drain from Africa because it perpetuates bad conditions in large parts of the continent.
The Council is involved in developing concepts of mobile partnership and circular migration and, for this purpose, is continuing its missions to African countries.
I should mention that during our Presidency there will be a mission to Nigeria and to the Republic of South Africa.
The Council is pro-active and wishes to contribute.
It is a fact, however, that this is an area that falls into the third pillar - an area of justice and home affairs - where frequently there have been long procedures in search of a consensus.
If the Lisbon Treaty is ratified and implemented, this will be an area where future decision-making will be easier and faster.
Subject: Regional funding after enlargement
What solution has the Council found for the issue of redistribution of regional funding made necessary by EU enlargement?
<D>
in writing. - (RO) The incidence of global natural disasters is alarming.
We can see today the consequences of our irresponsible actions in the past as we are faced with a new challenge: combating the effects of climate change.
It goes without saying that the cost of the operations involved in rebuilding the areas affected by natural disasters are incomparably higher in relation to the efforts required for prevention.
At EU level we have instruments available for dealing with such situations, which supplement the projects carried out by regions.
For example, in the Western Region of Romania, which I represent, a project is being promoted for improving the capabilities and quality of the intervention system deployed in emergency situations.
The financial instruments available, including the Structural and Cohesion Funds, as well as the Fund for Rural Development, must be reviewed so that they offer greater flexibility in emergencies.
With regard to the Solidarity Fund, the lowering of the threshold for mobilising the fund and the possibility of making advance payments of the relevant amounts would speed up intervention and reconstruction efforts and make them more effective.
Last but not least, we will have to give due attention to an older initiative, namely the rapid reaction force, which will cover the entire territory of the European Union, because natural phenomena affect neighbouring regions, and this creates the conditions for solidarity and cross-border action.
<D>
(EL) Mr President, I should like to speak about accidents at work in Greece and Europe.
The shortcomings and negligence of shareholders, control mechanisms and national and Community authorities in applying health and safety regulations is criminal.
The statistics for my country, Greece, are tragic.
There were 142 fatal accidents in 2008 and there have been more than 56 since the beginning of 2009.
At a time when lives are being lost, companies, the national authorities and the Commission are addressing the issue in a very relaxed manner and crimes are basically going unpunished; crimes for the sake of profits, such as the crime which France Telecom has been committing since February 2008.
Last week, another worker, just 25 years old, committed suicide due to the intolerable working conditions.
What does the Commission have to say about that?
Had it been a different matter, it would have intervened.
That is why I call on the Bureau and my fellow members to observe a minute's silence at some point during the three-day plenary for the victims of France Telecom and other accidents at work.
<D>
(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I must thank and congratulate Mr Stockmann for his openness and capacity to achieve compromise between the various interests involved in the preparation of this high-quality report, particularly with regard to the outermost regions.
I support the broad lines of the Commission's proposal and I am committed to this report because it guarantees non-discrimination in airport charges, except where this is compatible with, and necessary under, the Treaty, specifically with regard to forecasts for the outermost regions.
A compulsory procedure for consultation between airport management bodies and users must exist.
Any differentiation in charges must be transparent and based on clear criteria, taking into account the principle of territorial cohesion.
According to our proposal, future remodelling will be possible for objective and transparent reasons of public interest, particularly in relation to universal access.
Member States must ensure, and I quote, 'that airports levy the same charge for the same service.
The airport managing body may grant airport user concessions on charges based on the quality of a service used, provided that the concession in question is available to all users of the airport under publicised, transparent and objective conditions.
It may grant a concession to users which open new routes ... in accordance with EC competition law ...

<D>
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in a few days' time a delegation from this Parliament will travel to Istanbul to take part in the 5th World Water Forum, an event which will bring together all the global players with an interest in water: UN agencies, development banks, States, professional organisations, NGOs and local authorities.
At a time when water is becoming an increasingly scarce resource and the pace of climate change leads us to expect more and more conflicts in relation to access to water, I wanted to prepare for this meeting by putting a strong text to the vote within our institution in order to lay the foundations for European action in this field.
The situation is serious, as you know.
Water shortages have spread beyond the traditionally arid areas.
Access to water, the quality of which is constantly deteriorating, has become a concern for all of us.
The UN figures speak for themselves.
One billion people do not have access to safe drinking water; two and a half billion people do not have access to sanitation; five thousand children under the age of six die every day from diseases caused by lack of clean drinking water or sanitation, or by their poor quality.
The scandal is that the first victims are always the poorest.
Access to water, which will be one of the main challenges in the years to come, could further delay the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.
The next World Water Forum must be an opportunity to find solutions together to respond to this enormous challenge.
My first priority was to emphasise that water is a shared resource of mankind that should be a universal right.
That is the first paragraph of the proposed resolution, and it is vital, because the policies we are implementing depend upon it.
Remembering this basic principle means saying 'no' to making water a commodity, since, unfortunately, we know only too well the disastrous consequences of that.
The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) report of 2006 shows there has been flagrant injustice.
The lack of distribution systems has often resulted in a lack of safe drinking water for the most disadvantaged people.
Consequently, millions of people have to resort to unofficial sources which, taking into account the intermediaries, charge prices that are five or ten times higher.
We are fighting for access to safe drinking water and sanitation for all.
This means that water has to remain under public control, which alone can assert the common interest.
It is this principle that should guide our policies, and I am pleased that the resolution makes reference to it.
Public intervention is indeed able to resolve this problem of access.
A pricing system that is fair and sustainable for all would be both less costly for poor people than having to resort to the unofficial sector and would allow investment in the necessary infrastructures.
This goal can be achieved only if we all contribute to it.
Public development aid must therefore be used together with the resources of local authorities, bank loans, private capital and innovative partnerships.
I should like, in particular, to stress the importance of financing based on solidarity, such as that made possible under the Oudin law in France.
The latter allows local authorities to collect one cent per cubic metre from their users' water bills to finance international cooperative actions dedicated exclusively to water.
Is the Commission prepared, Commissioner, to encourage the development of this kind of instrument?
Such development has to be done in accordance with the notion of the public good, and that is why I am pleased that the text of the resolution points out that public-private partnerships must be strictly defined and subject to regulation.
Since the last World Forum, the role of local authorities has been recognised by all the stakeholders, including members of Parliament and ministers.
The next forum, in Istanbul, will stand out because of two major advances: the signing of an agreement by local authorities on water and the organisation of two days wholly devoted to the role of the local authorities.
Are you prepared, Commissioner, to make use of the enormous reserves of expertise and of human and financial resources of the local authorities to encourage the North-South Partnership?
With their successful experience and their technical skills behind them, the cities of the North are keen to help their counterparts in the developing world.
Finally, the UN has today published a report on water that makes some frightening projections for the future.
Under the double pressure of demographic growth and climate change, the water crisis has been made worse by the inadequacy of the political reaction.
While water is the priority for all development policy, only 6% of international aid is devoted to it.
That is why I want Europe, our Parliament and the Commission to send a strong message to the people of the South, because this inequality of access to water cannot continue.
<D>
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (ES) Mr President, Parliament adopted a resolution on this issue, the Council of Europe adopted another text on this same issue, clear and explicit in all areas, but those of us with some legal knowledge are aware, and it comes as no surprise to us - I say this with a certain amount of irony - that there is a rule of law, especially criminal law, whereby no one is obliged to make self-incriminating statements.
This is what surprises us: that the Council and all the governments are applying it to themselves.
In this case, instead of taking action they have decided to remain silent, like the man in the dock who does not defend himself but refuses to accept the charges by simply remaining passive and silent.
It is shameful to see the Council as an institution and all its members acting in a collective fashion, collectively availing themselves of the law used by defendants in court.
Institutional silence concerning responsibility, whether active or passive, through actions or through negligence, through conviction or the fear of causing problems following pressure from an ally nation: this silence is one of the major disgraces of the democratic context we live in today, and it affects all those involved.
It is likewise difficult to apply mechanisms of responsibility in the European Union, because the mechanisms are not intended to be used against all Member States acting to protect themselves in a reciprocal fashion.
Certainly no one imagined when the Treaty was drawn up, when Articles 6 and 7 were being drafted, that we would find ourselves in a situation where we would not be discussing infringements of fundamental rights, or passiveness concerning the defence of fundamental rights by a government, but by a European institution: the Council as such remaining a passive accomplice, with the complicity of all Member States.
That situation was never envisaged, and this truly affords it protection.
We have no legal mechanisms to take action against this, but I wish to tell the Council representative that History will clarify matters, because History will always bring to light the shame of this time when, on the pretext of protecting our freedom, all the concepts on which this European Union was founded have been jeopardised.
<D>
Mr President, I should also like to thank Mrs Laperrouze for her friendly, obliging cooperation.
It did prove possible to retain a vestige of the positive outcome of first reading in spite of everything but, all the same, what we have here today is a poor show.
Most of what had been achieved has been lost following lobbying by the agrochemical industry and the less efficient among the public regulatory authorities.
What we are discussing today are the sad remains.
Our overarching aim is to progressively improve water quality in European rivers and lakes.
Copious pesticide use in agriculture and toxic industrial discharges must be curbed, and tough requirements must be enforced regarding the quantity of the priority substances or priority hazardous substances permitted in water.
The weakness of the present report is that there is no real political will to scrutinise any more substances.
It has already become clear that the present system, under which substances on the list are to be examined and new ones added, at best works too slowly.
If the precautionary principle were to hold force, a number of other substances would have to be examined, but we are letting that possibility slip through our fingers.
In addition, it is not clear what it takes for a substance to be declared so hazardous that it has to be banned completely.
We have ended up with a number of substances that are in all likelihood extremely hazardous, yet the Commission balks at finally banning them.
This is unacceptable: if a substance is hazardous, it is hazardous.
We must monitor whether the Commission gets going with the examination of these substances or whether it just continues to put off taking a position on the grounds that it does not have enough data.
If that is the case, it should go and get the data.
There are some improvements.
For example, countries must now chart sources of pollution and also include concentrations in sediment and biota.
In addition, the Commission is not permitted to wait until as late as 2025, as it had wished, to review the situation.
It must produce such a review in 2018.
Yes, we shall be voting in favour of this report.
We are thankful for small mercies following a downturn of the kind seen after first reading.
<D>
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, I welcome Marian Harkin's report on volunteering and congratulate her on her collaboration with colleagues in its drafting.
Over a hundred million EU citizens volunteer, and every one euro spent in supporting them generates a return of between three and eight euros.
With 1.2 million volunteers in Scotland - with its population of 5 million - and the voluntary sector amounting to 5% of Scotland's workforce, we must publicly recognise volunteers' efforts throughout Scotland and the EU.
The report gives credit to volunteers and focuses on the benefits of volunteering for the economy and social cohesion.
It rightly demands that this contribution should appear in national accounts.
It states that volunteering contributes about as much to gross domestic product in a wide range of countries as the construction industry or the utilities industry.
This means that the not-for-profit sector accounts for 5% to 7% of the GDP in some EU countries.
Volunteering is good for you, your community, your region's economic development and your national economy.
It also helps build the social capital that public policies need to succeed.
I urge the European Commission to put in place a plan 'B' which would ensure valuing, validating and visibility for volunteers throughout Scotland and the rest of the EU, and I urge colleagues to support the Harkin report.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I will focus on the report, since it is an extremely useful and important report.
I would like to thank Mr Ehrenhauser for his contribution.
The report is useful because it rightly focuses on the key element of civil-military cooperation, which is exactly the Commission's priority.
It deals with the main points related to the EU's comprehensive approach in crisis management.
The establishment of the European External Action Service is the exact expression of this priority.
The very concept of the service that the High Representative is putting in place points in the same direction as the one suggested in the report, in particular, through the inclusion of the structures of the Common Security and Defence Policy in the External Action Service.
We fully support the development of civilian capabilities in order to have a proper balance between resources.
The appropriate modalities for recruitment are now agreed, and appropriate expertise can be brought into the External Action Service.
As everyone knows, this was not possible before.
A number of points in the report have been taken into account, and specific actions have been launched.
This relates, in particular, to fostering civil-military synergies, better usability of the EU battle groups, training, financing, and cooperation with key partners, in particular, NATO and the United Nations.
We also support the reinforcement of relations between the EU and the United Nations.
We have already done a lot together.
The High Representative again met with the UN Secretary General in Lisbon last Saturday.
The relationship between the EU and NATO is an important issue, as was illustrated just yesterday at the NATO summit in Lisbon.
We also favour implementing all practical measures which can reinforce concrete cooperation between the EU and NATO and ensure, in particular, cooperation when both are deployed in the same theatre.
The Commission and the High Representative herself are looking forward to working together with the European Parliament on this important issue of civil-military cooperation.
<D>
Mr President, yes, the Commissioner is right.
The Arctic is quite different in many ways from the Antarctic, and it was only a few months ago, on 8 October 2008, that I spoke to this House on this very topic.
The Arctic, as I said then, plays an increasingly important geostrategic role in our world, and over the past decade several critical issues have emerged in this region.
We are now faced with the opening of hitherto closed seaways, a direct result of climate change.
This comes as no surprise, since the Arctic is warming at a much faster rate, with an increase of two degrees in the last hundred years, compared to an average of just 0.6 degrees in the rest of the world.
This highly vulnerable ecosystem is coming under increasing pressure from resource-hungry nations which wish to exploit its potential without having due regard to its fundamental importance as a stabilising force in the world's climate.
I agree with Mrs Wallis's point that a call for a 50-year moratorium on any exploitation is neither practical nor reasonable, but I think a limited moratorium on new exploitation - pending fresh scientific studies - is something all civilised nations could perhaps agree to.
Apart from this, the EU counts amongst its Member States no less than three Arctic nations along with two other EEA neighbours, accounting for more than half the numeric membership of the Arctic Council.
This is reason enough for us to be able to assert ourselves, in the best sense of that word, on the global stage on this issue.
The Arctic is critical for global climate, and for this reason alone we must be part of a new style of governance for this beautiful and - as the previous speaker said - one of the last wildernesses of our world.
<D>
Madam President, Commissioner, the reform of the common market organisation (CMO) imposed by the united forces of the lobbyists and Eurocrats will cause three serious problems.
It aims to eliminate the market regulation mechanisms, liberalise planting rights from 2015 and allow the cohabitation, under virtually identical labels, of very different categories of wine.
These three heresies will be fatal to European wine-growing, particularly in France.
Consumers will be misled in their choices, wine-growers will see their incomes collapse, and the industrialisation of the sector will lead to the loss of specialist know-how.
This systematic dismantling of the fundamental principles which define the specific nature of European wine-growing responds to a peculiar logic.
Trapped between its submission to the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the influence of the all-powerful European big business lobby, the CEEV, the Commission has since 2004 systematically devoted itself to opening the doors of the European henhouse to all the foxes roaming the planet.
It increasingly seems to be acting as the shoehorn of globalisation.
This incoherent logic becomes clearly apparent on examining two sets of figures.
In Europe, 170 000 hectares of vines have been uprooted, whereas in New Zealand the planted area has increased by 240%, in Australia by 169% and in China by 164%.
In Europe, the reduction in supply to keep prices at a decent level is being undermined by the actions of large-scale wine manufacturers who are offloading their surplus products at low prices and thus grabbing the spare market.
This sums up the racket in the rosé market.
It reveals the contradictions that exist between the WTO principles and those needed to organise a sector in order to promote investment, quality and know-how.
Yesterday we successfully discovered that quality would in the future turn to quantity.
With the Commissioner's reforms, it is becoming clear that today's decisions will kill tomorrow's know-how.
Commissioner, it is vital to prohibit blending before 7 June.
After that, the only weapon left to wine-growers in order to make their voices heard will be the vote.
<D>
Mr President, Mr Barroso, in September 2009, I had to tell you that your political guidelines were continuing a failed Commission policy.
Your neoliberal guidelines do not reveal a strategy for more social justice, nor do they provide better protection for Europe against crises.
They provide no basis for the work to successfully combat poverty and social exclusion in Europe.
Now you are presenting to us the College of Commissioners that best suits your programme.
You can expect no applause for this from my group.
Already during this new parliamentary term, this Parliament has demonstrated that it takes democratic control and codetermination seriously, and I very much welcome that.
I am thinking of the new Framework Agreement between Parliament and the Commission and of the rejection of one of the candidate Commissioners, and I hope that, tomorrow, Parliament will once again be conscientious in its addressing of the SWIFT agreement.
Transparency and fairness are vital in the agreements between the institutions - only when we have these can we begin to talk about policy.
It is about the people of Europe and the rest of the world, it is about good jobs and more rights to a good education and fair pay, it is about their right to peaceful development and an intact environment.
Therefore, Mr Barroso, my group will not support your guidelines or your staffing proposal.
Prepare yourself for our harsh, but fair, exchange of views with you and your College.
<D>
Mr President, this debate is about the nuts and bolts of Parliament, and it is our duty to ask if the proposals about groups are practical.
It was certainly with practicalities in mind, faced with the basic requirement of 30 Members, that I submitted my amendment - I think it was my amendment, Mr Corbett - which enabled the President of Parliament, with the agreement of the Conference of Presidents, to allow a group to continue its work for a limited period if it fell below that particular threshold.
In committee it was generally agreed this was a good idea to avoid a group being held hostage by a Member threatening to leave and thereby instantly disbanding such a group.
That is why I am somewhat attracted by this new compromise which has been proposed for a limit of 25 Members.
It does seem to me to be a sensible idea, which would alleviate one of the difficulties I was referring to when I prepared my amendment.
We must always remember, however, that we were elected to represent the views and interests of our electorate as a whole.
It is a fact that our European electoral spectrum spans an ever-wider variety of opinion, which is good for democracy.
It is not just the number of Members which increases in this Parliament; it is also the diversity of views which they bring with them.
If we are successfully to fulfil our parliamentary mandate, we must have the opportunity to fully mirror the views of our national electorates.
A small group in the European Parliament here may well represent a large body of opinion in Member States.
We need to be able to work constructively as a Parliament and also, most importantly, in line with the wishes of the people that we represent, however that is formulated in the disposition and composition of our groups.
So, whilst I welcome this possible compromise, I welcome a sensible and pragmatic approach to this matter.
I hope that we do not allow ourselves to fall into the trap of assuming that fewer groups necessarily means more democracy.
<D>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, safety is a sacred thing.
It must be given absolute priority.
What has happened in Berlin recently, where the suburban rapid rail system has gone to pieces as a result of profits being prioritised, must remain an absolutely exceptional case.
What bombs and shells were unable to do in the war, we have had to experience for the last six months in Berlin.
This state of affairs cannot go on.
Safety arguments are also often put forward when someone wants to stand in the way of competition.
In such cases, safety arguments are created in order to completely prevent the opening up of networks, something that we actually regulated through legislation and made compulsory for every Member State as from 1 January 2007.
You must intervene, therefore - the safety arguments must not be allowed to be abused.
Safety costs money, of course, but we need investment in the infrastructure and in safety.
The money is available.
I would remind everyone, for example, that the exemption from duty for kerosene costs European taxpayers EUR 14 billion every year.
If you were to spend this money on safety, we would have a European railway market and guaranteed safety, which is the order of the day.
<D>
(FR) Madam President, I wish to say that Mr Posselt's question is pertinent.
The Union for the Mediterranean is, to begin with, a union for practical projects.
It also has an intercultural vision.
It is obviously linked to economic development, and everything related to codevelopment is included in economic development.
Thus, in one way or another, I can confirm to Mr Posselt that these aspects will be dealt with at the appropriate time, in the framework of the projects and discussions on economic development between the two shores of the Mediterranean.
Subject: Opening of dialogue in Cuba
The Council Conclusions on Cuba of 23 June 2008 have been very well received in Cuban democratic circles, which appreciate the fact that the unconditional release of all political prisoners is a key priority for the EU and that it supports respect for human rights and genuine progress towards a pluralist democracy.
In line with the commitments the Council made in its Conclusions, can it indicate what effective measures it is taking to further develop dialogue with the representatives of civil society and the democratic opposition?
<D>
(PL) Mr President, this is a very tense debate.
I would, however, advise caution, great caution when making statements following the Irish referendum.
Any suggestion that Ireland should be shamed or even excluded from the Union is far more damaging to Europe than the outcome of the referendum itself.
Unfortunately, Mr Schulz, who was, as is his wont, somewhat excited, did make such a suggestion.
We should bear in mind that the paternalistic attitude adopted by Brussels caused irritation in Ireland and was one of the reasons why the people of Ireland voted against the Treaty.
It is not true that Europe will suffer without the new Treaty.
Europe will suffer as a result of conflicts of interest and because of the Member States' selfishness.
That has nothing to do with Ireland.
Europe's foreign policy will suffer because of Germany, for example.
Germany wishes to establish good relations for itself with Russia at the expense of the countries of Central Europe.
France is also to blame for turning a blind eye to Russia's neo-imperialistic policy in the region whilst uttering platitudes about how Europe, Poland included, is to forge ahead.
The Treaty should not be used as a smokescreen for our own failings.
The decision taken by the people of Ireland must not be used to conceal our own failings.
(Applause)
<D>
I am delighted to learn that the new common agricultural policy will end the period of discrimination against farmers in certain Member States, including my own.
I would like to thank the rapporteur for his work, which is clearly the work of an author who understands the issues involved.
I am all the more alarmed by the attempt to establish new discriminatory conditions.
The capping of direct payments is a new form of discrimination against Member States in which, for historical reasons, most of the agricultural undertakings manage larger areas of land.
These agricultural undertakings comply with the same rules and provide the same services as small undertakings in other countries, and they fulfil the conditions for direct payments equally well.
The discrimination against large undertakings resulting from capping may put jobs in rural areas at risk, and stifle innovative potential.
If we want to talk credibly about a single market, can we really countenance discrimination against certain Member States in the form of differences in payments per hectare or capping?
Farmers from the 12 new Member States have now reached the end of a difficult 10-year period, which they agreed to on the understanding that it was a transitional period which would not be extended.
Let us not prolong these inequalities contrary to the spirit of the EU accession negotiations, and let us not damage the credibility of the EU in the eyes of some of its citizens.
We are gambling with the future of the EU itself.
I would therefore like to call on all fellow Members to support Amendments 10 and 11, which reject the capping of payments.
<D>
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - (DE) Mr President, the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy thanks the rapporteur for adopting our proposals.
We think an agreement is reasonable, but would nevertheless point out that there have been considerable sectoral problems with Korea in the past.
I am thinking here of the discussion on dumping prices in the shipbuilding industry in recent years, for instance, where we also had lawsuits.
We wish to ascertain whether these sectoral problems are being resolved in order to ensure that both sides really are opening up and Korea is not the unilateral beneficiary, and that - even when we think of our pharmaceutical industry, the car industry, of the many industrial sectors - reciprocity is guaranteed.
One particular subject was Kaesong.
The Commissioner has just addressed the issue of how to involve these North Korean special zones.
According to what I am hearing, eight other special zones are planned.
In the opinion of the Committee on Industry, international standards must apply here.
We cannot undermine our own free trade agreements in this way.
We therefore ask that this aspect in particular be thoroughly checked.
Otherwise, many thanks - to the Commission, too - for these negotiations!
<D>
Member of the Commission. - (EL) Madam President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, I would like first of all to thank Mrs Willmott for the excellent report which she has prepared on the Community strategy on health and safety at work.
The Commission places a high policy priority on health and safety at work, and shares your views on a large number of your recommendations.
Indeed, I would like to emphasise that it must be a Community strategy and not merely a Commission strategy.
This is truly the only way to achieve the fundamental and ambitious aim, which is a continuous and sustainable reduction in occupational accidents and diseases.
One of our foremost concerns, therefore, will be the participation of as many sides as possible at political, operational and institutional level.
The Commission's strategic aim of achieving a 25% reduction in work accidents in the European Union in the years 2007-2012 does indeed require the active participation and commitment, not only of the public administrations, but also of the social partners with their responsibility, at workplace level, for preventing accidents.
It is very important to stress the commitment which the Member States entered into with the Council resolution of 25 June 2007: to develop and apply strategies for public health and safety at work, geared to national conditions, in cooperation with the social partners, and also to set national, measurable targets for reducing accidents at work and the incidence of occupational illnesses, especially in those sectors of activity in which the rates are above average.
The Commission is particularly pleased with the European Parliament's response to its communication, and with the support for the general priorities and lines of action set out in that communication.
I have noted Parliament's concerns regarding the need for adequate planning and distribution of resources, and regarding the assessment of progress, and submission of progress reports, in respect of the strategy targets.
The Commission will provide details and the exact plan of the special measures to be taken at Community level, on the Community Agenda scoreboard.
We will also secure the participation of the Advisory Committee on Health and Safety at Work, within the framework of a three-way exchange of information on the content of the national strategies, the targets, the actions undertaken, and monitoring of progress made.
Parliament will be promptly informed of the results of this procedure.
As regards your request for a review of Council Directive 91/383, I would like to inform the honourable members of the European Parliament that the departments of the Commission are at present analysing the situation in various Member States on the basis of a study prepared by an external consultant.
In 2008, a relevant report will be drawn up, and the Commission will decide what further action to take in this area, taking account of the conclusions of the report.
As regards the request for review of Council Directive 92/85, I would also like to inform you that the departments of the Commission, after consulting the European social partners on possible amendments to that Directive, are now carrying out an impact assessment to determine the consequences of certain amendments to the Directive.
If, on completion of the impact assessment, the Commission decides to submit a relevant proposal, there is little doubt that this proposal will be approved by the Commission in 2008.
I share your view on the need, within the coming period, to improve the enforcement of Community legislation on health and safety, especially for SMEs, with a combination of measures which will give balanced emphasis to employer responsibility and worker participation.
As regards occupational health, I expect the new strategy to be a further step towards creating a healthier work environment throughout the EU, where the needs of an ageing employee population will be met and the more vulnerable groups will be fully protected.
The Commission will intensify its efforts in the direction of adequate definition of health indices and other statistical measures, to ensure that occupational health hazards are properly monitored.
We are confident that the priorities set out in the Community strategy 2007-2012, and those set out in the report which you will approve today, will open the way to safer and healthier workplaces in the European Union.
<D>
(DA) Mr President, participating in the debate this evening is a somewhat special experience.
For five years I have been working closely with Catherine Guy-Quint.
The two of us have been budget coordinators for our respective political groups.
We have had our battles along the way, but most of the time we have fought together in the spirit of cooperation which pervades work in the Committee on Budgets.
You are finishing, Catherine, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank you more officially for the time we have spent together.
I have learnt a great deal!
My French has improved and I have also learnt a lot from your style, which I have come to respect.
You are more no-nonsense than I am, but sometimes that is necessary!
This evening the outgoing Parliament is handing over to the new Parliament, which will be elected from 4 to 7 June.
If the voters of Ireland vote yes in October and the Treaty of Lisbon comes into force at the end of the year, we will have to act quickly because there are major consequences for Parliament's work; not least in the area of budgets.
This is described well and clearly in Mrs Guy-Quint's report.
You have completed a first class piece of work to hand on to the new members of the European Parliament.
Parliament will be formally involved in establishing the multiannual financial frameworks, but we still have not succeeded in securing a change in this framework period from seven to five years to correspond to the period of office of the Commission and Parliament.
This would enable us always to help shape these frameworks.
Parliament would have full influence over the entire budget, including the agriculture budget.
I believe that it would be good for the farmers and citizens of the EU if the discussions concerning agricultural policy were thereby thoroughly opened up and if the horse trading behind closed doors were replaced by open, democratic debate.
No one can say in advance what the result would be for the level of agricultural expenditure, but it would undoubtedly prevent schemes being maintained and developed if they cannot be clearly and logically explained to our citizens.
The annual budget procedure is being changed, and last year we tried out the new requirements made of work in Parliament's Committee on Budgets.
Having only one reading followed by negotiations to reach agreement forces us to prepare earlier and much more carefully.
That is not such a silly idea in essence.
I feel that last year's general trial of the new discipline had good results.
The Treaty of Lisbon gives Parliament new budgetary powers and new ways of working and Mrs Guy-Quint's report provides the forthcoming Parliament with an excellent basis for this work.
I hope and believe that we will succeed in getting the Treaty of Lisbon adopted, thereby ensuring that the work of the EU becomes more open and effective.
<D>
- (LV) Ladies and gentlemen, in a situation where, in the South Caucasus, the interests of several influential geopolitical participants are in competition, it is important to distinguish their true influence.
The report has to a great extent avoided acknowledging Russia's real role in this region.
Our experience in the Baltic States has shown us that the cause of many problems is Russia's neo-imperialist foreign policy and its wish to regain influence in the territories it has lost.
I cannot agree with the view expressed in the report that membership of NATO could foster a renewal of conflict in Abkhazia and South Ossetia.
We should note that more than 70% of Georgia's inhabitants in fact voted for NATO membership, but in truth Russia has complicated the situation by encouraging changes in the ethnic make-up and altering the make-up of citizens.
We must not ignore the people's wish to get closer to Western democracy.
Proof of Georgia's democratic progress is also provided by the presidential elections of 5 January which, by and large, were held in accordance with international standards.
It is possible that we have been too critical of Azerbaijan, since a desire to respect human rights has been displayed - 119 prisoners were released in December's presidential decree, including journalists.
The European Union must be more actively involved in the resolution of protracted conflicts, which is a precondition for stability and development.
The first step could be to encourage an exchange of Russian military forces for international peace-keepers.
We must speak to Russia in clear language.
Using the language of fables is not the way to move from promises to action.
Thank you.
<D>
(SL) I, too, would like to express my sympathy for the events in Haiti, as well as congratulate the European Commission and European institutions for their relatively appropriate response.
Nevertheless, like some of my fellow Members, I, too, wonder whether our response has been rapid enough.
It might perhaps be a good idea if Mrs Ashton, Vice-President of the Commission, personally visited the scene of the tragic event, as that could prove important for several reasons.
I disagree with those of you who argue that the presence of soldiers and other law enforcement personnel might herald the beginning of a colonial approach on our part towards Haiti.
In my opinion, such talk is neither fair nor appropriate.
What is important, however, is that, at the next International conference on Haiti, we adopt long-term measures for the re-establishment of state institutions, to enable them to work again.
Here I refer, in particular, to health and education policies.
Only policies of this kind, and only development in these areas and institutions, can shape Haiti into a more stable country than it has been to date.
<D>
(DE) Madam President, the fact that the European Union has such a poor public image unfortunately has a great deal to do with OLAF.
I agree with the previous speaker that OLAF is neither fish nor fowl and it takes a characteristically arbitrary approach.
OLAF employees have been coming to me and telling me how depressing things are, that two types of measurements are used and that no clear standards are set.
One OLAF employee even compared OLAF's practices with those of the secret police, in other words, an undemocratic institution.
The occasion was, of course, once again the so-called Galvin report, the internal report in which many of the practices of Members of the European Parliament are disclosed which, if OLAF were to use the same standards, would have led to large-scale investigations, including one of Herbert Bösch, who refers to himself as the father of OLAF.
What is happening in this case to the German Members among others?
What is happening to many other Members?
Instead of taking the correct approach and doing what was done in my case, in other words, saying that we are acting on our own initiative, where there is clear suspicion of fraud, for example tax evasion or illegal party funding, OLAF sits back and does nothing.
Of course, this also has a lot to do with the personal approach of the current Director General.
This is a challenge for you, Commissioner.
What is happening here is not worthy of a democracy.
In my case, they made up technical errors and searched and searched.
In the end there was no truth in the accusations, which was embarrassing for OLAF.
However, in cases where there may be some truth in the suspicions of fraud, they do nothing and simply look the other way.
For this reason, I am of the opinion that many EU officials work in the same way as OLAF and that an EU officialdom of this kind can no longer be supported, that many EU officials should be brought before a court and that we need true democracy at a European level at last, with separation of powers, and not an OLAF like the one we currently have!
<D>
The strategy pursued so far on Afghanistan has not brought the expected results.
I was pleased to learn of the establishment of a calendar for NATO involvement in Afghanistan and of the signing of a declaration on long-term partnership with the country during the NATO Summit in Lisbon.
The EU, too, is presenting a more consistent and better coordinated approach to the region, which takes account of civil aspects and the significance of regional cooperation.
We should continue to support reforms intended to combat poverty, discrimination against women and the production of opium.
Our efforts must concentrate on increasing respect for human rights and law and order, building a state of law and integrating Afghanistan fully into the international community.
They should also include building and reforming the administration and the public service corps by training programmes, help with construction and the use of existing infrastructure and advice from the EU.
Afghanistan should participate in establishing and implementing priorities which will help to build civil society and ensure that Afghans assume responsibility for the country.
At the same time, we must remember to ensure the security of those we send to Afghanistan - the trainers and members of the armed forces whose job it is to see that these plans are put into effect.
We cannot agree to ending the use of remote controlled aircraft, as this would cause a significant reduction in the safety of these people.
Our strategy should take into account both the security of the citizens of Afghanistan and of our representatives, who are working for the development of the country.
<D>
Mr President, four years later we are at last having a debate on the European City Guides.
I could not carry down the files of complaints I have, as other colleagues have outlined.
Europe gets beaten about because it does not connect with its citizens and here we have a golden opportunity - and I direct this to the Council - to connect with people who have a real problem and who are coming to their MEPs for a solution.
It is not just businesses that are affected.
I have heard from school secretaries who signed this in error and are terrified and who have paid over money.
The tragedy with European City Guides is that it works because people are threatened and terrified.
Whether you pay or not, they continue to harass and abuse people.
But it is a European problem and therefore requires a European solution.
I suppose I am celebrating slightly that we are having this debate and that my colleague, Simon Busuttil, is going to have a report and prepare information, but I think the Council needs to be a little more proactive on this, and indeed the Commission likewise.
The question is very specific and it raises five key issues that need to be addressed.
In my view, this problem is enormous but we need to have it quantified.
Exchanging information is a great idea but it could cause frustration if we do not have action as a result.
We must close loopholes.
For example, in Ireland, European law is being quoted to those who have signed up to European City Guides.
They are being told that they will be taken to court in another Member State and fined and penalised.
They are getting phone calls with huge amounts of harassment to themselves and their co-workers.
This is not acceptable.
We definitely need to redefine what a consumer is because, as I said earlier, this is not just about business.
But I repeat the point.
We have a golden opportunity here to show people all over Europe that we are active on issues that are hitting them directly.
Let us seize the moment and let us not waste it today with just words and no action.
<D>
Mr President, in acknowledging the hard work that our rapporteur, Ms Klaß, has put into this report entitled 'The situation of women in rural areas of the EU', I would have to ask: compared to men in rural areas or women in urban areas?
What is the context in which we are talking here?
There is no such homogeneous group as 'women in rural areas of the EU'.
I am a woman from a rural area of the EU, but the lady who lives down the road from me with six or seven children and a husband who is unemployed, and who cannot afford her rent or mortgage, is a different type of woman in a rural area.
It is not a homogeneous group, and we must be very careful in this issue.
Many women in rural areas have an urban lifestyle; others have a lot of poverty and hardship in their life.
You have an urban lifestyle in the middle of the countryside if there are two cars outside the door, all mod cons, ICT and perhaps a foreign holiday a year.
So let us give it some context.
The real issue here is the restoration of choices to all women: the choice to marry or not; the choice to have children or not, to have a career, to have further education or not, to stay at home, to go out into the workplace, to start a business or to have access to property.
A few years ago when I went to buy an apartment in Brussels, the Brussels bank manager would not sign off my mortgage unless I got my husband to sign it.
This was only a few years ago in Brussels.
I got my mortgage and my husband did not sign it.
Might I say that I objected strongly!
So the access to money, property and business - there are lots of different types of women in rural areas.
<D>
on behalf of the UEN Group. - Mr President, I would also like to compliment Mr Florenz on his effort and commitment in producing this report and, of course, on his ability to listen to, and understand, the many varied and different opinions.
As legislators, it is paramount, in the midst of a massive economic downturn, that we work on results for green energy technology.
We can become world leaders in our diverse renewable energy fields, which should create a tight, effective and coordinated strategy - including governments, NGOs, academia, business, forward-thinkers - seeking not to talk but to solve.
We need to reduce bureaucracy and support SMEs and technology developers.
The market is there.
The regulatory framework is clear.
We have set the targets for renewable energy.
Although funding is scarce, it is crucial to technology development and to maintaining expertise.
Banks and funders will have to take risks on green technology start-ups.
There will be long-term gain if we step up to the mark.
The jobs and wealth will flow.
If, on the other hand, we dilly-dally during this precious time, we will lose out and other countries will be only too ready to fill the gap.
For example, Ireland could become to ocean wave technology what Finland is to mobile phone technology.
We have the undisputed potential due to weather and location in the Atlantic.
We have the technology patented.
We have the expertise in situ and we have the legal target framework.
The market is clear, so it is a magnificent opportunity for job creation, electricity price reduction, energy security and carbon emission reduction, not to mention patent revenues.
We now need to get behind our companies, who have been working for over a decade to come to this point.
They have taken the risks, and we need to support them through increased funding.
Delays at this point would be detrimental.
Green technology is our future.
We have the opportunity now, so let us use it.
<D>
(ES) Madam President, Mr Dimas, Mr Borloo, ladies and gentlemen, it is time to act.
The package of legislation that we are debating allows us to do so.
Although the outcome of this package is not exceptional, we should feel reasonably pleased.
If it is adopted tomorrow, it will send out a clear signal to other countries that the European Union is committed and is leading the fight against climate change.
Addressing this climate change and the transition to a low-consumption, low-carbon society is a key global priority.
This legislation will enable us to plan future investment to reduce emissions, especially through energy efficiency and the gradual dismantling of those obsolete plants that emit huge amounts of CO2.
I would like to thank everyone - especially Mrs Doyle - who has enabled us to be here now, feeling pleased at having a package of legislation that I hope we will adopt tomorrow.
<D>
(HU) Thank you, Mr President.
I would first of all like to congratulate Mrs Thomsen on her excellent report.
Considering the challenges posed by climate change, our high dependency on fossil fuels and the growing challenge of creating rural jobs, the European Union needs a clear, easy-to-follow regulatory system enabling it to operate effectively as regards renewable energy production, and especially as regards biomass production.
We need to create the kind of legal environment for producers that clearly sets out activities and operating frameworks relating to renewable energies.
There is little point in our having directives to increase the share of renewable energy if the appropriate conditions are lacking; those concerned will not want to risk starting up this new kind of production.
We cannot allow a situation to arise where we mislead farmers by encouraging them at European Union level to produce the raw materials for bioenergy production, while in some countries the regulatory framework at national level does not provide an optimal environment for doing so.
A long-term, well thought-out programme is needed, because otherwise producers will see this new type of production as too big a gamble.
We must guarantee security of production, but we cannot expect consumers to pay the higher retail prices.
Producers need incentives, and in some cases tax allowances will need to be provided to ensure that the transition does not entail operating difficulties for them.
We must provide appropriate incentives to ensure that biofuel production will not bring about a rise in food prices, because this would undermine the whole programme.
Thank you for your attention.
<D>
- (DE) Mr President, the large majority of people in the European Union, probably the majority of governments in the European Union, and almost certainly the majority in this House, hoped in November that Barack Obama would be elected president.
That is a good thing, even if perhaps a little scepticism has crept into some of the speeches during this debate as to whether all this was such a good thing.
Of course Europe must consciously represent its own positions in the future, but the time for malicious comment about the United States is past, because we can no longer conveniently shift everything on to George Bush, and that sets us a task.
Policy on transatlantic relations on the part of the European Union, on the part of this Parliament, can no longer consist simply in tossing demands in the direction of the United States; now we must also reply with what we want to contribute in order to make this partnership efficient.
Take for example Afghanistan, which several Members have mentioned.
What do we want the European Union to do in order to enhance and strengthen police missions, in order to push ahead with civil support and civil reconstruction in this country?
That would be our task as the EU; NATO can take care of the military side.
This is something that we must discuss very specifically.
What do we have to offer?
<D>
(DE) Thank you Madam President.
I shall try to keep to my speaking time.
In principle, we welcome the introduction of SIS II and its functionality.
In my time as Minister for the Interior at the beginning of this millennium, I lobbied intensively for this system.
At that time, we were promised that it would be introduced in 2007, one reason being that we urgently needed it for the new Member States so that they could participate in this security architecture.
The new Member States are here, but SIS II is still not here.
The delay needs to be relentlessly analysed and investigated.
There must also be clear consequences.
We should learn from past experiences for the future.
We must admit that the Commission has done everything to advance the SIS II project, including putting up with less than perfect test results.
However, we must not forget that it makes no sense to make too big a compromise here because it would be at the expense of the stability and reliability of the system.
We should therefore prevent any additional financial burden for the Member States which might come out of the analysis or the tests and any further delay in the system.
What we need for this is 100% transparency, as well as clear language for those implementing the project on the Commission's behalf, and that must also mean that, where necessary, there are financial consequences for these project managers.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the Commission as a whole welcomes wholeheartedly the interest that Parliament is taking in the Common Framework of Reference, or, as I will refer to it in short, the CFR.
The CFR is a long-term project to improve the quality and coherence of EU legislation.
Let me answer your questions in this connection.
First of all, I would like to say that the Commission indeed intends to ensure that the Commission CFR will be translated so that it can be discussed and applied in order to improve the quality of EU contract law legislation and to make it more coherent.
However, this reasoning does not apply to the academic preliminary draft.
The Commission CFR will most probably be considerably shorter than the academic draft.
Given the huge work which will already be necessary to translate the CFR, it does not make sense to spend valuable translation resources to translate parts of an academic draft which are not relevant for the purposes of the CFR.
The Commission is currently proceeding to select those parts of the academic CFR which are relevant for the final Commission CFR, on the basis of its policy objectives.
All the DGs concerned are involved in this selection process according to their field of competence, of course including DG JHA.
The final selection will be presented for consultation to the other institutions, including Parliament and stakeholders.
The Commission will indeed ensure that the outcome of the workshops which were organised in 2007 will be taken into account in the CFR.
The Commission has always conceived the CFR as a tool for better law-making.
The CFR should contain a set of definitions, general principles and model rules in the field of contract law.
The Commission has not yet decided which topics of contract law the CFR should cover.
In adopting the decision on CFR, the Commission will take into account the position of Parliament and the Council.
As I have already mentioned, the Commission will in all likelihood shorten the present academic draft and it will probably be necessary to amend the remaining text in order to make it useful for policy-making purposes.
Even if it is premature to say so, it is likely that the CFR should form a non-binding legislative tool.
The Commission understands fully that Parliament wants to be kept informed of, and involved in, the ongoing work on the CFR.
We welcome Parliament's involvement in the CFR process and we very much rely on this involvement.
The Commission will continue to keep Parliament informed of developments in the most appropriate way, in particular through the Parliament working group dedicated to the CFR, and will consult Parliament and all stakeholders on the results of its preliminary selection process.
Once the Commission CFR is completed, the Commission will decide on the need for keeping it up to date and on the best possible mechanism to do this.
I would like to conclude by thanking you for Parliament's support for the Commission work on this important dossier.
<D>
(HU) The European Commission is the European Union's defining decision-making body.
Requirements as regards Commissioners should be the following: the right person, based on his or her career path and preparedness, in the right position.
The manner in which Commissioners are nominated and elected, however, ensures that this positive outcome is achieved only incidentally.
Governments do not recommend people for a particular assignment, but for an office.
Anyone they nominate will - unless he or she withdraws - become an EU commissioner.
The President of the Commission is trying to find an assignment for the person in question, and thus the sequence is reversed.
This means that I am trying to find a coat to match the button.
Something else that is worth mentioning: the specialised committees' hearings are not followed by a vote, but instead, a small circle of people write letters about the hearing.
You are always talking about democracy, and yet are still afraid of direct elections.
Whether it be the EU constitution, a referendum or a committee meeting about a potential candidate.
In the course of the hearings, the Commissioners-designate scarcely said anything concrete.
They did not want to make a commitment, to accept responsibility.
Even so, it nonetheless became clear that they are not breaking with the former Commission, but want a centralised Europe; they have not drawn the lessons of the financial crisis, but continue to follow liberal economic policy.
There are many of us, therefore, who will not vote for this Commission, and that does not make us anti-Europeans.
We are simply doing what our voters - many million European citizens - expect of us.
<D>
(NL) Madam President, allow me to begin by expressing my doubts about the timing of the resolution now under discussion.
It is true that the June European Council asked Parliament to present a draft concerning the future composition of Parliament, but we now discover that the whole proposal is based on the Reform Treaty, a text that has yet to be ratified, let alone enter into force.
In other words, we are putting the cart before the horse.
Incidentally, it is not the first time this has happened, and it is really starting to become sickening.
I am speaking here not on behalf of the Identity, Tradition and Sovereignty Group but as a representative of a small Member State - or rather a future Member State, as it is no longer a question of if but when Belgium will be split up and Flanders becomes an independent state.
I digress.
I think that the principle of degressive proportionality advocated by this report is the most workable and also the fairest starting point if one believes at least that the smaller Member States and their representatives in this Parliament must be able to go on playing a meaningful role.
In any case, I support a broad interpretation of this principle of degressive proportionality, and therefore intend to support the relevant amendment by Mr Bonde.
In my view, it is in the interests of the European Union that the smaller Member States have the best possible representation in the European Parliament; if not, we shall see a further fall in popular support for the European institutions.
<D>
(RO) I firmly believe that Europe 2020 will create a more economically powerful and more innovative Europe.
I am also convinced that we will successfully emerge from the current economic and financial crisis because we have huge potential in terms of an innovative labour market, as well as natural resources.
I welcome the efforts made by the Commission to present this communication to us.
However, I feel obliged to raise the cohesion policy for discussion and express my dissatisfaction that the path towards implementing the Lisbon Strategy seems to have changed tack.
Achieving economic, social and territorial cohesion involves factors other than those relating to growth which is smart, sustainable and conducive to inclusion.
Citizens are saying through us and our elected representatives that they still need investments in infrastructure, access to services and the development of all regions, no matter how isolated they are.
The priorities set for the 2007-2013 period have shown what a great need there is to improve the infrastructure and support economic competitiveness in the convergence areas.
Interdependence among economies shows the need for cohesion and ensuring [...]
(The President cut off the speaker)
<D>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to say that the work that has been done by Mrs Doyle and all the MEPs on this directive, which was objectively difficult, is absolutely crucial and essential.
Yes, Mrs Doyle, I do think that we have respected the confidence pact.
There were two really essential issues.
The first question was: are we still in codecision due to the schedule?
I confirm that we are in a genuine codecision procedure.
Time was short for everyone, due to international events that are not anyone's fault, not Parliament, the Council or the Commission, but because of Copenhagen and the European democratic pace.
To tell you the truth, I am not sure whether, if we had had much more time, we would have done much better.
There are times when speed enables you to manoeuvre more easily.
This is a truth well known to skiers, and I think, rapporteur, that you found a way to bring Parliament's strength to the trialogues, in particular on the essential issue of the second stage.
The rest is in the text.
The real question is 20% to 30% and comitology or codecision, at a time when Europe needs to be able to manoeuvre in negotiations.
We will probably have to invent a somewhat informal travelling trialogue process around Copenhagen, a little before and a little after, so that Copenhagen is a real international success and there are real conditions for change.
In any case, you know that on this point we abandoned comitology for codecision, which I think is essential both for this particular report and for this directive.
One final point: like us, you want the allocation of auctioning to have a more affirmed, more significant substance in the context of the trialogues, for which we ultimately have clear support from the Commission.
In the meanwhile, we have increased our capacity from 20% to 50%, in the declarations of the Member States, for the use of these auctions.
In a few words, that is what I wanted to say.
I do not think that the schedule has at any point or in any way affected the reality of the codecision procedure, which is just as essential as unanimity, which was not compulsory, was essential for the Council and the Heads of State or Government.
<D>
The debate on the Lamfalussy Process was allowed to run 30 minutes into Question Time.
As a result, I could not be here.
I understood questions were starting at 18.00, that there would be 30 minutes for the first Commissioner, and then I would be the second questioner for the next Commissioner.
The procedures of this House are absolutely crazy.
This is supposed to be a model of organisation.
The kind of organisation and the kind of procedures that we have here would not be tolerated in the most disorganised village or town council within the European Union.
It is absolutely crazy.
Question Time should be sacrosanct and there should be absolutely no overrun.
It discriminates against those Members who put down questions well in advance and there is absolutely no excuse for it.
<D>
The 12 points set out in the report provide a clear action plan for the future.
However, to be able to implement it at a local, national, regional and global level, we need the support of well-informed citizens.
According to a special Eurobarometer survey in spring 2008 on 'climate change', approximately 41% of Europeans stated that they were poorly informed about the causes, consequences and ways to combat climate change.
In Romania, over 65% of citizens said they had no information about this.
Raising the profile of this issue among the public through education and awareness campaigns implemented in areas of everyday life is a vital step in this direction.
The Commission and Member States must finance public awareness campaigns and create conditions for training people for new careers adapted to the specific challenges of the labour market brought about by structural economic changes, which are accelerated by climate change and its effects.
In the current economic crisis, the EU must commit itself politically and financially in the key areas of maintaining and developing 'clean' technologies for combating climate change, supporting cross-border adaptation measures, boosting energy efficiency and providing assistance in the event of disasters, according to the EU's principle of solidarity.
The upshot of all this is the creation of 'green' jobs in new, competitive enterprises.
<D>
(PT) Mr President, Mr Barrot, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate Mr Coelho, Mrs Roure and the other Members on their work.
In December 2004 the Council adopted the Regulation on standards for security features and biometrics in passports and travel documents issued by Member States.
We have now had to take new steps towards combating the abduction and trafficking of children.
The use of passports by children according to the principle of 'one person-one passport' may be a fundamental means of winning this difficult and important battle.
In my country, Portugal, collecting the fingerprints of children aged six years and upwards is already a long-standing practice, which is perhaps why I have no objection to it.
As an upholder of the European cause, I believe that it is important to have harmonisation in this matter.
It reassures me to know that the Member States which, like Portugal, long ago set six years as the minimum age for taking fingerprints will not have to change their national legislation.
I must emphasise that the passport security which is now being reinforced does not end with the existence of a passport.
The passport in itself corresponds to an increased level of security, starting with submission of the documents required for issuing passports, followed by the collection of biometric data, to verification and matching at cross-border check points.
This report is one more step in affirming the rights of individuals and guaranteeing their security.
<D>
in writing. - (PL) I voted in favour of the report by Mr Florenz entitled: 'Towards a Europe free from tobacco smoke'.
Tobacco smoke is a very harmful substance.
It contains thousands of chemical substances, including over 250 carcinogenic and toxic components.
Even the slightest exposure to these substances can contribute to the development of tumours.
Tobacco smoke particles are deposited permanently in enclosed areas causing air pollution that even the best ventilation systems cannot deal with effectively.
Thousands of people die each year in the European Union as a result of passive smoking.
These deaths could be prevented.
It has to be possible for every European Union citizen to live and work in surroundings that are free from tobacco smoke.
This must be emphasised particularly in connection with public institutions and premises.
Seventy per cent of the population of the European Union is non-smoking.
We must bear this in mind and ensure that these people are able to live in a clean and safe environment.
<D>
(EL) Mr President, the EU shares responsibility for the unjust and dirty war waged by NATO against Yugoslavia.
It is jointly responsible for the murder of thousands of Yugoslavs; for the enormous destruction inflicted on the infrastructure, factories and the country as a whole, and for the use of enriched uranium.
Those who should be arrested, tried and sentenced for war crimes are Bill Clinton, Tony Blair, Javier Solana (the former NATO Secretary General) and the other leaders of the countries that attacked Yugoslavia.
Unfortunately, nothing of the kind has happened.
Yugoslavia has been dismantled; you are creating protectorates and you are now trying to annex Serbia.
You are asking for a declaration of repentance from a people who did what is self-explanatory: they defended the independence of their country.
You may receive such a declaration from the government, but the young people will not forget and will not forgive the crimes of ΝΑΤΟ and the EU.
You are now continuing the same policy with the independence of Kosovo and the creation of a new protectorate.
Among other things, the measures proposed in the report are an attempt to redeem slaughter and destruction by using money from the workers of Europe.
The measures aim to present the murderers of the Yugoslav peoples as saviours in a bid to create favourable conditions for linking Serbia to the imperialist chariot, and for European capital to take over the country.
The Communist Party of Greece condemns this report and believes that the interests of the Balkan peoples will be served if we do not forget, but struggle against the EU and the barbarity you are nurturing.
<D>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in her speech this morning, Mrs Harms posed the question of why the spark is no longer being passed from the summits to the people and why new courage and new confidence is not emanating from the summit discussions.
As I listened to you this morning and also just now, Mr Barroso, and to Mr Van Rompuy or the Council, too, I got an idea of why the spark is not being passed on.
The spark is not even passing into the Chamber here - just look around you.
Of course, it is important for more Members to be here.
Why are they not here?
It is wrong for them not to be here.
However, they are not really hearing anything new anyway.
You are telling us things that have already been said in the newspapers many times and you are not providing answers to the very pointed questions that have been asked.
What is happening with regard to the financial transaction tax?
Mr Schulz has asked about this many times.
Where is the answer?
It is not on the agenda of the G20 summit in Seoul.
I would like an explanation.
I would also like to know why the European Council, the Belgian Presidency, said that it is in favour of this, but why the European Council at its last three summits merely said that it recommended a feasibility study at global level but not at European level.
Why ever not?
Does the Council not see the dead end into which you are directing this matter?
I will ask you once again, Mr Barroso: when will Mr Šemeta comply with the demand made by this Parliament at the beginning of this year, namely that we want a feasibility study for Europe, too?
If you present an opinion on this subject, this Chamber will actually be full and we will listen to you.
However, do not avoid the issue any longer.
For Europe alone we are talking about EUR 200 billion per year.
Ask the Members who belong to the Committee on Budgets what trivial, small amounts they are currently arguing about with the Council.
With an initiative we would make progress.
We need to breathe life into the roles, then the spark will once again be passed on.
That is what we expect from you.
<D>
- Madam President, those of us who believe in freedom, individual liberty and the rule of law have for years sought to persuade our American friends to close Guantánamo Bay, or the detention there.
So the country that calls itself the leader of the free world cannot put aside those values for its convenience, albeit understandable security concerns.
Now that President Obama has announced the closure of Guantánamo Bay, we should be helpful in any way we can.
However, it is not for the European Union to determine who enters the European Union countries.
It should be for Member States, and let us call upon the Member States of the European Union to do their bit to help our American friends at this time.
They have shown the will.
They have listened to us.
It is about time we listened to them, just as the European political élite should listen to the voters when, in referendum after referendum, they have rejected the Lisbon Treaty.
It is time for us to listen to the voices that count.
<D>
(DA) Mr President, fortunately the Lisbon Summit ended well.
Some excellent preparatory work was carried out by the German Presidency, and the Portuguese Presidency completed it in a professional manner.
Unfortunately, I must point out that national interests have again played a role.
This is definitely not appropriate for European cooperation.
We must now have special powers to discuss the content instead of the process.
However, we have unfortunately seen depressing tendencies that suggest that we would rather discuss the process rather than the content.
However, if we are ultimately to discuss the process then I would like to state clearly that we do not need referendums to ratify the Treaty.
Referendums are simply not the solution.
Let the representative democracy do its work!
It is not because I am afraid of a no vote - far from it!
Rather it is because it is completely wrong to separate EU issues from national parliamentary elections.
The EU is and will remain a completely integral part of national policy.
Referendums are used to fire shots at a government in office.
They enable the other political parties to avoid being assessed on their EU policies.
However, all political parties will of course be assessed on their EU policies, and this will happen when we go to the polls in the national elections.
However, it imposes two requirements: a requirement that we, the electorate, allow EU policy to be decisive in our choice of national politicians, and a requirement that the political parties must of course not use referendums to avoid responsibility for the European Community.
Therefore, efforts to ensure that it is the content and not the process that is given the highest priority will hopefully be successful.
<D>
Madam President, the agenda talks of a new strategy for jobs and growth - by which they mean loss of jobs and negative growth!
GDP fell by 4% in 2009, and 10% of the workforce - 23 million people - are unemployed.
What will be the European Council's remedy?
More immigration!
Look at the European pact on asylum and immigration, which features on the agenda.
If you believe that our problems will pass with the current crisis, think again.
As they admit, competition from emerging economies is intensifying.
What will be the European Council's strategy to deal with this?
More globalisation, open the door to more goods from the emerging Third World economies, export jobs by off-shore employment.
The countries of Europe can only compete with the goods, services and employees of the Third World and emerging economies if our wage rates fall to their level - and do not think innovations in capital and techniques will save us.
Our innovations of today will belong to the world the day after tomorrow.
Globalisation spells poverty for the nations of Europe.
<D>
author. - Mr President, this House has taken a clear and strong stance as far as the death penalty is concerned.
It supports its abolition and the need for an immediate moratorium on executions where the death penalty still applies.
The latter is the case in many states in the USA such as Georgia, where Troy Davis is awaiting his lawful killing to be carried out at the end of July.
Apart from ideological and humanistic considerations against executing human beings, in the case of Troy Davis there appear to be additional reasons in the form of serious doubts as to the robustness and validity of the evidence which led to his conviction in the first place.
Such doubts, we believe, justify the reasoning of any individual using common sense that retrial should be granted in this case.
Consequently we call on the relevant authorities in the USA to order that Troy Davis be retried and, if found guilty again, that his death sentence be commuted to life imprisonment.
Furthermore, we call once again on the US Government, and all governments in the world that still have capital punishment, to abolish the death penalty in the interests of humanity.
In particular we call on the governments of those countries such as China, Iran, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia where executions are still carried out regularly, and where in many instances this is done in a most appallingly barbaric way, to stop executions.
<D>
Mr President, could I suggest that we stop beating ourselves up over climate change and blaming each sector as if one is more guilty than the other?
In particular this impression comes through about the contribution made by agriculture.
Europe is powerless on its own to do anything about climate change, but it can provide much-needed leadership.
We need global coordinated action, and that is recognised.
Let me deal specifically with the debate around agriculture.
It contributes to climate change but it is also affected by it: that has been stated already.
However, it is important to remember that agriculture produces food and without food we are not going very far.
If you look at global demand for food it is set to increase by 50% in 20 years, but agriculture can, through carbon sequestration, anaerobic digestion, forestry planting - and I think that is the key - and wind energy, contribute to this debate.
In terms of the Irish situation we have actually reduced our emissions from agriculture by 3% since 1990, but look at what has happened to transport, where emissions are up by 163%.
For industry the figure is 23%, and for energy 32%.
The danger of targeting agriculture is that we will reduce cattle numbers and reduce emissions in Europe, but we will transfer production elsewhere and make absolutely no difference.
So we do need to be careful on this.
Traditional practices, like digging your garden in the autumn and leaving it over winter, are now a no-no.
Well, I am guilty because I still do it.
Let us be sensible in this debate.
Let us do the research and development so that we do not go backwards, but go forward with positive solutions.
Look at India.
It has 17% of the world population but only contributes to 4% of global greenhouse emissions.
It has got to develop to look after its poor people.
It will contribute to the debate on climate change but it can only do it in a way that recognises its real present situation.
Finally, can I say that the Lisbon Treaty, for the first time, gives us some hope for a global action on climate change, with Europe providing leadership.
On that basis I hope that the Irish population turn out and vote overwhelmingly 'yes' to the Treaty of Lisbon.
<D>
author. - (SV) Mr President, I am very pleased that we are able to have this debate today.
At this time of increased protectionism and with poverty spreading instead of decreasing, it is particularly important for us to keep trade open between Europe and some of the world's poorest countries.
This is essentially what the interim agreements are all about.
The Economic Partnership Agreements seek to guarantee continued trade and development in some of the world's poorest countries.
These countries are at risk of being the hardest hit as the global recession surges forward and the protectionist arms race looks set to intensify.
I cannot, therefore, understand some of the criticism that has been expressed.
Some people claim that these agreements go too far and are too comprehensive.
Some critics would rather talk of lost customs revenue than of the potential for new trade.
I think, on the contrary, that we should be pleased that we have achieved so much.
I do not believe that there is an inherent conflict between trade and development as some speakers claim.
Quite the contrary: trade leads to development, duties lead to poverty.
I was responsible for the interim agreement with Ghana.
I acknowledge, first of all, that it contains a few flaws, such as the continued imposition of EU duties on rice and sugar for a transitional period, but it is, essentially, a very good agreement.
It is therefore important for us to ensure that it is signed as soon as possible.
The presidential election in Ghana previously presented an obstacle, but now I would like to urge the country's new President, John Atta Mills, to sign the interim agreement.
I also hope that we in the EU will be sure to sign the agreement that we have negotiated.
It is unacceptable for it to take so long, and it is particularly unacceptable for it to take so long due to the failure of the translation service in the Council to function adequately.
I would like to take this opportunity to urge you all to support the agreement.
In these times of uncertainty, the world needs more trade, not less.
<D>
Madam President, my political group participated actively in the drafting of this motion and improved the text, so that it no longer conceals the hypocrisy which exists when it comes to the exploitation of workers from third countries.
We know that the parents of children from Member States working in any other country receive child benefit.
We know that countries which have bilateral relations can have the family connection.
So why does this phenomenon arise, which the Commissioner says cannot be measured?
We have films, we have documentaries which have been shown on television all over the world, including from Romania and Ukraine and other countries.
One such film was shown here in Parliament and we saw the situation.
It is therefore hypocritical of us to say that we have no evidence.
It is hypocritical of us to say that there is no family and that is why there are abandoned children.
There is a family, but there are no proper bilateral relations and agreements to cover parents so that they do not abandon their children and there is no help from the European Union for these countries in building the infrastructures which will help to ensure that children that find themselves in this situation can be rehabilitated, without carrying the trauma with them their entire life.
I think that raising awareness among the parents who come to our countries to work is also our affair.
If one part of the body hurts, the whole body hurts.
If some of our fellow human beings, especially children, are suffering in our neighbouring countries, later we shall see them arrive here with other more threatening methods and then we shall lock them up in our prisons.
<D>
(PL) Debates, discussions and negotiations on an international climate agreement in Copenhagen have been going on without a break for months.
In the clamour of information, where some countries are bidding and competing with each other in declaring ever more ambitious goals, others are announcing grand expectations, and yet others have an entirely passive attitude, and it is easy to lose sight of the main purpose of what is, quite simply, a historical agreement.
For we are talking about combating climate change - change which could lead to a true ecological disaster.
We are talking about the common future of the planet - the future of all of us.
This is why educational work is also so important.
I have the impression that the opinions of European citizens are increasingly diverging from those of the political elite.
There is a danger, here, that proposals which are put forward in the Copenhagen forum may be treated simply as a kind of divine intervention or a fabrication of the political elite.
We need to work at educating the citizens, and the European Commission should be responsible for this.
Combating climate change must not be treated as a whim of wealthy countries which want to force their point of view on others.
I think that in this matter, the Commission and the Representations must maintain a permanent policy of information and education.
Also needed is a strong policy supporting the search for effective technologies to capture the carbon dioxide produced from coal used as an energy source.
This technology should be given the same political status as other renewable energy sources.
This should be a priority in the work of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology, which we established recently in Budapest.
The last thing - the costs of establishing a special fund to support the fight against climate change, should be spread equally across the Member States depending on the level of their wealth.
<D>
Question No 36 is inadmissible as its author is no longer a Member.
Subject: Amendment of the CMO in wine
On 4 July 2007 the Commission unveiled a proposal for a Council regulation on the common organisation of the market in wine.
Funds for the 'national envelopes' are allocated according to a key which is based to 50% on the historical input of Member States, 25% on area and 25% on production.
Moreover, adjustments have been made in favour of certain Member States.
Will the Commission say which criteria were used in the selection of the specific allocation key and why the funds are not allocated on the basis of the historical payments of Member States over a representative reference period, as occurred in the case of all those CMOs which have so far been amended?
Furthermore, given that the overall amount of resources is limited, how was it decided to adjust input for the benefit of some Member States, which necessarily results in a corresponding decrease for the others?
<D>
(NL) Mr President, Commissioner, I share the view of other Members that it is an important achievement to have this proposal on the table at last.
It meets a need, a reality on the ground and it means we can really do something for people.
Some members claim that only the well-off will be able to get themselves treated abroad.
We must make sure that healthcare abroad is accessible not only to the most affluent, because they are able to use the law to obtain expensive procedures.
Patients have a right to clarity and legal certainty and we can work on that, that is our job.
The proposal is a distinct plus for EU citizens.
It is not perfect, of course, there are a few improvements to be made.
I am thinking of the definitions of 'hospital', 'non-hospital care' and so on and the identification of specific cases where prior authorisation may be warranted.
These are things we shall certainly address in the debate.
So I hope our debate will be calm and pragmatic and not an ideologically based debate.
Other aspects will need to be dealt with by national legislation, but I absolutely cannot agree with those who say that this proposal undermines the ability of Member States to organise their healthcare.
I think it most important that we discuss this proposal.
<D>
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FI) Mr President, Commissioner, crude oil is more expensive than ever.
This also has an effect on the price of other fossil fuels.
The cost of all forms of energy is rising, as four fifths of the EU's entire energy consumption is fossil fuel-based.
People are not prepared to reduce consumption, so there is a need for new technologies, greater energy efficiency, carbon capture and storage (CCS) and new nuclear technology, including research into nuclear fusion.
After the vote in the Committee's report, the hopes and dreams for the main alternatives are linked to CCS technology and nuclear power.
There are no guarantees, however, that liquefied carbon dioxide can be stored safely in perpetuity.
There are no signs that there might be investment in the hydrogen economy within the context of the transport infrastructure, let alone the use of electric cars running on carbon dioxide-free electricity, as is called for in the report.
It will probably take half a century to tame nuclear fusion.
All in all, the Commission's proposal that by 2020 20% of the energy consumed in the EU should be produced with renewable fuels is just not credible.
That will not be possible, at least not with renewable fuels produced in the EU's own territory or in the EU's big Member States.
The report under discussion presents far too optimistic a view because it suggests that fossil fuels will continue to be used, without any real alternatives and with no restraints at all.
They will only stop being used if something forces the situation.
We will be forced into this if natural resources run out before 2020, but it will not happen as a result of any systematic effort on the part of the EU Member States or an EU declaration.
In fact, it will take not only volition, fine words and pious hopes, but also genuine action which challenges our present lifestyle.
Furthermore, the pricing system for electricity, where wholesale prices for electric power are determined by the power exchanges, should be rethought.
The price is always set by electricity produced at the most expensive production costs as well as that produced based on the most expensive allowances.
This is the price which all the producers get.
Unfortunately, there are no guarantees that companies will spend the excessive profits they make this way on research into energy, as it is in the spirit of the times we live in that they distribute their profits in the form of dividends to their shareholders.
Emission allowance trading is also a way to increase the profits of the electricity companies rather than reduce emissions.
<D>
(SK) Slovakia, a Member State of the Union, has adopted the European Union's value system, which means that it should also respect the principles of the cultural and linguistic diversity of the Community.
However, the recent survey by the Open Society Fund points to a dangerous increase in Slovak pupils' hatred of the Hungarian minority and shows that more than 63% are of the opinion that, in public, Hungarians should speak only Slovak, with use of the Hungarian language being limited to their homes.
The outrageous thing is that even the Minister for Education gave his full support to this view in parliament.
This is a startling situation.
The Minister's position is unconstitutional and contradictory to Slovak legislation and the principles on which democratic Europe is based.
Since the coalition government of Mr Róbert Fico came to power, something has been wrong in Slovakia.
Anti-Hungarian, racist and xenophobic displays have been getting more numerous, chiefly due to Mr Ján Slota, the chairman of the ruling party.
The perplexing thing is that neither the prime minister nor the representatives of the coalition parties are protesting about this, nor are they condemning this damaging and dangerous trend.
<D>
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, my colleague from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats said that the sector is very concerned that, if someone drives for just one minute too long, he or she may have to pay up weeks later.
Regrettably - from my point of view - I can put her mind at rest.
Firstly, checks in the Member States are very permeable, with most Member States taking lightly or disregarding their monitoring obligation.
Secondly, criminal prosecution in this field is still in its infancy even though the state of affairs is disastrous.
When, for example, a driver who has been working for 38 hours without a break is stopped on the Inntal motorway, no one can tell me he has failed to find a car park; instead, there is often pressure from employers for drivers to keep going until they are ready to drop.
This is dangerous for all the other road users.
I need not go into detail about the gravity of accidents involving heavy goods vehicles.
This is also a concern for local residents, of course, as some of these vehicles may also be carrying dangerous goods, which then cause damage.
Therefore, I think it extremely necessary and important that there be proper monitoring in this area - it is essential!
Secondly, I think that particularly with the introduction of digital tachographs, there is now such a long history of implementation in the Member States that the time is coming, slowly but surely, to enable those wishing to perform monitoring - for the benefit of drivers, local residents, other road users and road safety in general - to do so more effectively at long last.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I think that have you touched on very serious issues that are generally linked to the issue of disability.
Firstly, I would like to say that unfortunately at present we do not have as yet at our disposal comparable data that provides a good basis for a reliable European strategy.
Acquiring data that can be interpreted as such is one of the Commission's goals.
We also have to realise that the debate you started and the issue you mentioned are very closely connected to the debate on services, on generally beneficial social services.
Again, this is a related topic.
I would also like to stress that a Directive concerning air traffic and the mobility of workers or mobility of people within the European Union has been implemented, and that of course there are plans to extend these regulations to other types of transport, which is logical.
There is also the issue of the transferability and accessibility of social services or various social measures for disabled people.
This issue is dealt with within the framework of implementation of Regulation 1408/71/EEC on the coordination of social security schemes and in the Directive on the portability of supplementary pension rights.
The aim of all of these tools is fundamentally to reinforce the values of, and opportunities for, an independent life, with a corresponding degree of safety, anywhere in the European Union.
<D>
During the vote on Parliament's calendar of part-sessions for 2012 and 2013, 58% of MEPs approved an amendment abolishing one of the two October part-sessions held in Strasbourg.
That amendment is quite simply a violation of the Treaties!
The Treaties designate Strasbourg as the seat of Parliament and stipulate that 12 part-sessions must be held there annually.
Two part-sessions are held in October to catch up on the work that is not carried out in August.
Outside these part-sessions in Strasbourg, meetings of the parliamentary committees and additional part-sessions are held in Brussels.
In 1997, the Court of Justice clearly established the principle that the European Parliament must meet every month in Strasbourg.
The Treaties leave no room for doubt: Strasbourg is not the second seat of the European Parliament; it is the institution's only seat.
The anti-Strasbourg group is becoming organised and flexing its muscles more and more, in an attempt to make people believe that Parliament is unanimously against Strasbourg.
The supporters of the Alsace seat must speak out more.
They have the legitimacy of the law and of 50 years' history of European integration on their side.
<D>
(NL) Mr President, I too want to take the opportunity to express my concern at the violence against Christians in India in recent weeks.
Dozens of people have been murdered and thousands driven from their homes.
Hundreds of houses have been set on fire and even churches have not been spared.
The European Union must call upon not just the central government of India but also the governments of the states to do everything they can to stop the violence and bring the guilty to justice.
At the summit in Marseille next week, as well as reinforcing the strategic partnership with India as far as our trade relations are concerned, cooperation in the fight against terrorism must also be extended.
The bomb attack in Islamabad last week has once again shown how much the neighbouring country of Pakistan is plagued by the problem of Islamic terrorism.
Certainly in this political transition period in Pakistan it is very important that relations between India and Pakistan should not deteriorate.
The European Union must provide all possible assistance to keep the dialogue going and encourage further dialogue.
India has a fast-growing economy, which is having an impact on the demand for energy.
It must therefore be the policy of the European Union to ensure that India does not become too dependent on countries such as Iran and Russia.
<D>
rapporteur. - Mr President, I would like to thank my colleagues for their comments and support, but I do want to have a few words with Commissioner Barrot in particular.
I hope you have heard the impatience and the frustration that has been expressed right across this House tonight about the endless delays to this long-awaited legislative proposal on measures to combat illegal logging.
Please take back to your colleagues the fact that this Parliament believes that it is utterly unacceptable that that legislative proposal is constantly delayed.
I am very sorry that you have not been able to answer a question that has been put to you at least three times by people here tonight about when we might expect that proposal.
I think it plays very badly with the public as well.
I think it looks very bad that the EU is unable to get its own house in order.
We like to talk about the political leadership that we like to think that we have in the world.
If that political leadership means anything, then it should mean that we stop the sale and the import of illegal timber into the EU, and we want to see much more urgent action to achieve that.
While I have the floor, I would just like to raise one other issue.
Many colleagues have mentioned the link between deforestation and climate change, and I would like to add a final point about the climate package that colleagues will be voting on in the coming weeks.
You will know that deforestation is a key issue when it comes to the emissions trading system, and I want to urge colleagues not to be persuaded by arguments in favour of including so-called 'sink credits' in the emissions trading system.
We held a lunchtime debate about this today in which we underlined why putting deforestation into the emissions trading system is a bad idea for a host of reasons, not least that it would swamp the whole emissions trading system.
There are big problems around the verification, monitoring, reporting and liability regimes.
We certainly do need to tackle deforestation as part of the climate package, but we are arguing that that should be done by using the auctioning revenues to properly invest in those countries that have that issue.
Commissioner, please make autumn the moment when the EU really starts to get credible on forestry.
Please assure us that you will bring forward that proposal as soon as possible.
<D>
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is the last plenary sitting of this legislative period.
My fellow Member Mr Öger has just said that Turkey is a priority.
In recent years, as rapporteur for my group, I have been able to deal with this issue and I must say I am very happy that in this last session we are once more getting to the heart of the matter, namely the question of democracy in Turkey.
It is the first Copenhagen criterion that is in question.
There are varying opinions as to how Turkey has developed.
However, I believe that in one respect there is consensus: the pace of reform in Turkey seems to have slackened; the impression at the end of this legislative period is that Turkey now has further to go before it will be ready for accession than it had at the beginning both of the mandate of the Commission and of the legislature of this Parliament.
For the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe the problems of freedom of the press and of opinion are particularly important in this context.
You know that you cannot watch YouTube in Turkey.
The rights of journalists, publishers, publicists, columnists and authors are restricted by certain legal regulations.
The Commission has thankfully indicated in its progress report that this is a problem.
In the opinion of many observers, these problems have increased.
I would be grateful if the Commission would say something about this - whether it believes the problems have got worse or whether things have got better.
That would be really surprising.
In addition, there are important subjects like the protection of religious minorities and the safeguarding of women's rights.
However, the key issue at the moment is the question of freedom of the press, the revoking of the press accreditations of critical journalists by the Prime Minister, the largely unjustified arrests of critical journalists and publishers in the course of investigations into the clearly criminal Ergenekon network, the takeover of the ATV-Sabah media group by the Scharlach-Holding, which is owned or controlled by the Prime Minister's son-in-law, the Prime Minister's public calls to boycott media and the judgement against the Doğan media group and fine of EUR 380 million with the aim of forcing it out of business because it reported the lighthouse donation scandal, and his preferential treatment of the AKP.
This is not only a question of press freedom, it also scares off investors, who doubt the certainty of the law in Turkey.
Turkey is an important neighbour, an important, respected NATO partner.
We want to continue supporting Turkey; that is the opinion of my group.
However, we believe that a great deal has to be done here, that the Turkish Government must demonstrate its will to no longer ride roughshod over fundamental European rights, as it is doing at the moment.
We would be grateful if this could be documented persuasively in the next legislative period.
Moreover, I believe that we should have this debate not in Strasbourg, but in Brussels.
<D>
in writing. - (LV) I take considerable pleasure from the fact that 23 EU Member States have been able to agree on a package of measures for safeguarding financial stability and promoting growth - the Euro Plus Pact.
Also of importance is the agreement that has been reached on structural reform and fiscal consolidation and the final resolution on the amendments to the Treaty of Lisbon for the establishment of the European Stability Mechanism.
All countries must implement fiscal consolidation measures and measures aimed at preventing macroeconomic disequilibrium.
Structural reforms to promote employment and social inclusion must also be implemented.
They must be defined according to each country's particular situation.
The participation of 23 European countries in this pact leads us to hope that these measures will encourage economic growth.
This is a step in the right direction and a sensible response to those economic challenges.
This pact fits splendidly with the work of Parliament and the Commission on improvements to the single market and the three reports that we are approving in Parliament this week.
We must take even bolder decisions.
Member State governments must not seize the pretext of the electoral cycle in order to put off taking important but unpopular decisions.
g tax harmonisation, Hungary does not wish to apply the agreement in its entirety for the time being because we have an interest in enhancing our competitive advantage, and through this in real job creation in the long term and economic growth.
<D>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner De Gucht, if you meet with representatives from ten governments in a small group in a back room in order to agree on a global surveillance regulation containing such sensitive chapter headings as 'enforcement of the law' and 'civil penal measures in connection with border controls and the Internet', you can hardly be surprised if rumours emerge and if questions are raised to which citizens rightly want answers.
I totally agree with the criticism levelled by my fellow Members.
However, you need to be aware of the concerns behind the questions from the Committee on International Trade, which have cross-group support, namely, that an agreement that was originally supposed to be about the protection of engineering achievements and patents is now reaching deep into the area of civil rights, the democracy of communication, the decentralised potential for innovation and cultural development and the protection of personal data.
However, Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights also govern your negotiations and we will remind you of this continually.
Such an agreement will affect the whole world.
However, you are excluding the emerging economies and developing countries, as well as civil society organisations, trade unions and national parliaments from the negotiations - to put it simply, you are excluding the general public in whose service and under whose control you are supposed to be.
You are negotiating without a mandate from the European Parliament.
You continue to fob us off with two-page summaries of the results of whole negotiating rounds.
You refuse to follow the new law and disclose to us the same documents that the Member States receive in relation to these negotiations.
If you now claim that the concerns of my group are unfounded, then prove it.
Lay the negotiation documents on the table straight away.
If you dream of one day receiving the approval of this Parliament for the results of your negotiations, then you ought to learn from the experience of the democratic decision taken against the SWIFT Agreement.
All I can say to you is welcome to democracy.
This Parliament will no longer permit back-room debates and decisions.

in writing. - The British Conservative Delegation voted for this resolution as a straightforward endorsement of the recently negotiated UN Convention on Cluster Munitions.
We believe that the Convention has successfully combined principled and practical humanitarianism with appreciation of the military requirements of responsible armed forces.
We have consistently held the view that an indiscriminate ban on the use of all types of cluster munition would negatively affect the operational effectiveness of our armed forces.
We therefore draw special attention to the clearly defined exemption in the Convention for the next generation of "smarter” munitions which are designed to self destruct and present a minimal risk to civilians.
The British Ministry of Defence is currently developing a munition that falls within the terms of this exemption.
In general, we believe it is important to maintain a sense of proportion in relation to risk management by our armed forces.
While the British Armed Forces always seek to minimise harm to the civil population and limit collateral damage we should never lose sight of the fact that we are fighting terrorist and insurgent elements totally without scruples in the methods they employ for the indiscriminate destruction of innocent human life.
It is these elements that should be the target of our ire.

(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after yesterday's Sunday service in my home town, our Indian priest reported on the atrocities being committed in his home country.
For the last week, Christians in the state of Orissa in East India have been subjected to a campaign of persecution, humiliation, abuse and murder.
By the end of last week, this had left 26 people dead, with 41 churches destroyed, four monasteries in flames and many Christian homes in ruins.
People are taking refuge in the forests, praying for safety from the Hindu fanatics.
This is not the first attack on Christians, which is why some 60 000 Christians in Orissa have now fled their homes.
The present conflict was triggered by the murder of a spiritual leader and member of the World Hindu Council on 23 August.
Father Saji from my village has asked our parish to pray for the victims, but we can do more than that.
I utterly condemn these crimes against humanity.
The European Parliament must urge the Indian Government to guarantee the right to life and liberty of Christians in Orissa.
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, can I first of all thank Mr Davies very much indeed for all the work that he has put into this report, and for his extremely constructive cooperation.
I am happy, on behalf of my Group, to endorse the target of 125 g by 2015 that Mr Davies has outlined.
It is a target which, I think, is extremely environmentally ambitious, but it is also achievable by what is a very successful European industry employing hundreds of thousands of people, and we must ensure that it remains a successful European industry.
I am convinced that those European car manufacturers will continue to produce some of the most environmentally friendly cars in the world, and these new targets - which, we should never forget, are the tightest in the world - will help them to achieve even cleaner cars in the future.
But the missing link in this debate is, of course, that of consumer demand.
We must make sure that consumers are demanding cleaner, more environmentally friendly cars, and, there, the Member States themselves have a very important role to play through their tax systems, which is, rightly, a matter for them.
They can, however, considerably affect consumer demand by introducing the correct environmentally friendly taxation schemes.
We also, in my view, need contributions to CO2 reduction from all of the related sectors: from the oil companies, from the biofuel producers, from the tyre manufacturers etc., all of whom have a contribution to make and can help us to achieve our ambitious targets.
I have also tabled some amendments to water down what I think are some very prescriptive requirements on advertisers, which Mr Davies has included in his report.
I think they are grossly disproportionate to the problem, and I am sure that, given sufficient opportunity, the manufacturers and the advertisers can come up with a binding voluntary code which would be equally effective.
I have also tabled - jointly with Mr Davies - an amendment to recognise the contribution of small-volume manufacturers who do not have a huge product range with which to average out the emissions requirements.
I hope the Commission will take those into account when formulating the legislation.
<D>
in writing. - (PT) As we explained in a speech during yesterday's debate, the reasons for our vote against this proposal for a regulation are fundamental ones.
If there could be any doubts as to their justness, it would have been enough to follow the European Commission's speeches to dispel them.
The problem for the European Commission is overcapacity and the target and solution is the 'restructuring of fleets'.
What about the socio-economic crisis?
What about the rising fuel prices (diesel and especially petrol)?
What about the first sale fish price?
For the Commission, it is quite simple: 'if there is further reduction of capacity by some Member States, this will benefit other Member States, because if there is a reduction of capacity with a consequent reduction of effort, there would be more resources and more market opportunities.'
Hence the suggestion of about EUR 1.6 billion (!) just for vessel decommissioning.
'Simple' - if the disease does not kill the fisheries sector, the 'cure' will.
There is no funding to help the sector face increased production costs and to safeguard wages.
However, EUR 1.6 billion is being proposed for permanent, partial or 'temporary' cessation of fishing activities.
The Portuguese Government is following this maxim and is, for the record, allocating about EUR 8.2 million for the decommissioning of 27 vessels in 2008.
<D>
in writing. - (SV) We entirely agree with some of the views presented in this report, for example that it is urgent to combat sulphur and nitrogen oxide emissions from ships and that the common fisheries policy is too bureaucratic and centralised.
However, most of the proposals put forward are negative.
We have trouble seeing what could be gained from the introduction by the EU of a 'European Maritime Day'.
We also question the value of EU financing for maritime research and a plan to survey and map wrecked ships and submerged archaeological sites, and we are critical of the idea that EU institutions should address the subject of maritime spatial planning.
The report constitutes a further example of how the European Parliament seeks to gain influence in ever more areas of policy.
Respect for the subsidiarity principle, which is often paid lip service but seldom applied, is conspicuous by its absence.
We cannot accept that.
We have therefore voted against the report in the final vote.
<D>
Mr President, on 2 October, the Irish will have a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty.
The Lisbon Treaty is almost identical to the European Constitution, which was rejected outright by the French and the Dutch.
The Lisbon Treaty has already been rejected by the Irish once, but 'no' is always the wrong answer, as far as the European Union is concerned, when it comes to further political integration.
And so the Irish are forced to have yet another referendum so they can deliver the only answer that is acceptable to the European Union - which is 'yes'.
The European Union is destroying democracy in its Member States.
The EU is founded on misrepresentation, deceit and lies.
The British are denied a referendum by our contemptible government and political class precisely because they know that the result would be a resounding 'no'.
But whatever the result in Ireland, Britain will one day leave the European Union and restore its national independence.
I am proud to use my position of office to campaign for Britain's unconditional withdrawal from the European Union.
<D>
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (EL) Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Wagenknecht had the initiative to draft a report, which is proof of the political courage it took to highlight the redistributive and social dimension of taxation policy.
This document is one of the more important pieces of evidence showing that the debate on taxation policy may become Europe-wide.
The commitment to meet the Lisbon targets, the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact, the obligation to administer and redistribute tax revenue so that it meets cohesion and employment objectives, and the completion of the internal market - all these are proof enough of a political aim.
The taxation policies of Member States can no longer be based exclusively and solely on national criteria: dialogue on taxation is becoming necessary to promote greater tax coordination throughout Europe.
Given such a dialogue, which has enabled substantial cooperation between the shadow rapporteurs of all the political groups, we have concentrated on the following fundamental points.
Firstly, on the issue of tax competition, we do not believe that the object ought to be to curb the principle of tax competition, for this would be tantamount to censuring the policies of certain Member States.
Owing to the lack of common rules on tax policy issues, tax competition with its offers and counter-offers of low tax rates creates problems.
As is also the case for the other sectors of the internal market, however, tax competition can ensure competitiveness and improve the productivity of national economies, as well as that of Europe as a whole, provided that the rules curbing the growth of harmful competition obtain.
The second point we focused on was the relation between direct and indirect taxation.
A trend has recently been noticed in Member States to increase indirect taxation, in most cases to cover their fiscal deficits.
This is a burden for consumers, however, and the market remains unmonitored.
The aim of this report is to find safety measures facilitating a balanced combination of direct and indirect taxes.
We are in favour of a revision of the system of VAT and special consumption taxes.
This should not mean that it is replaced by a code of conduct not binding on all the Member States.
Commissioner, we are aware of the efforts of the Commission and the problems at Ecofin.
Nonetheless, we as members of the European Parliament must above all closely cooperate with national parliaments to debate this major fiscal policy.
<D>
author. - (NL) Mr President, in presidential elections we increasingly see continuing uncertainty as to whether the preferred candidate of the ruling government has actually won a true majority of the votes as well as just a large number of votes.
Even where that candidate does have a true majority, doubts remain about the size of that majority, certainly where manifest attempts have been made to inflate it artificially.
When, in addition, some candidates are prevented from standing, when only the government-endorsed candidate has access to press, radio and television, when the opposition or foreign observers are not able to monitor the count properly, when peaceful protests against the officially declared results are broken up by army and police and opposition leaders are arrested, there is every reason for very serious doubt that the will of the electorate has been upheld.
We have seen controversial presidential elections of this kind outside Europe in Mexico and Kenya, and within Europe in Belarus, Russia, Georgia and Armenia.
Even without these elections Armenia was in an extremely difficult position.
Traditionally it has strong ties with Russia but is separated from it by neighbouring Georgia, which has a serious conflict with Russia, and neighbouring Azerbaijan, which has for many years had a border dispute with Armenia.
When the Russian province of Transcaucasia was divided up along ethnic lines in the 1920s the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, populated by Armenians, was given to Azerbaijan by way of a compromise, with a guarantee of regional Armenian autonomy.
That solution is no longer workable in the post-Soviet era, since the two states of Azerbaijan and Armenia are now enemies.
In fact the territory is currently occupied by Armenia, and this has led to a protracted conflict with its eastern neighbour, though a ceasefire is in force.
This kind of situation, with a permanent threat of war and blockades, provides fertile ground for authoritarian government to flourish and it is unremittingly difficult for democracy to function in the country.
The events since the 19 February elections come as no surprise.
Even so we must make every effort to get democratic conditions restored and the rights of the opposition reinstated.
The wishes of the European Union or its Member States for good relations with the de facto rulers of countries like Russia, Belarus, Georgia or Armenia must take second place behind this prime imperative.
<D>
We cannot allow the consumer to be misled by the food additive thrombin.
Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 regulates the conditions for food additives throughout the EU and we are now looking to include new substances in it.
The key thing here is the safety of substances.
In order to meet consumer demand for food which looks attractive, the food industry has created substances which are added just for the sake of better appearance.
One such substance is thrombin, which is obtained from edible parts of animals and which is not harmful to health.
Its role is to combine individual pieces of meat together into a single meat product.
Although not in itself a health hazard, parading individual pieces of glued together meat as a single piece of ham does constitute consumer fraud.
Although such products cannot therefore be banned on health grounds, they must be labelled very clearly and unambiguously by indicating not just the name of the product but also its effect and a clear designation of the processed product.
A piece of meat glued together with thrombin should never be allowed to go on sale as ham.
Instead, it must be clearly labelled as 'combined meat parts treated with thrombin'.
I will vote in favour of the approval of this substance only if we impose a clear labelling requirement.
<D>
Mr President, the word 'integration' has been used 24 times in this report.
The proposed integration of immigrants out of the national taxpayers' pocket has not taken into consideration one important aspect, namely religion and civilisation.
Militant secularists of socialist origin avoid this subject, although the Muslim population is shooting up.
By 2025, one in three people living in Western Europe may, or will, be Muslim.
The Archbishop of Canterbury has recently suggested that Europe should adopt Sharia law, which the President and the establishment of this Parliament would probably call 'multiculturalism'.
This brings a confused debate to the fore that has been developing over the ways and possibility of integrating and assimilating the new immigrants flooding into the continent.
Does assimilation mean that immigrants should absorb and be absorbed into European civilisation, or does it mean that they should join the descendants of old European nations to create some sort of new European man?
Or is the creation of a common civilisation either undesirable or impossible?
Although Europe has always had its full share of varying cultures, it has also had a mainstream Christian culture or civilisation, so to speak, in which most of its people, whatever their identities, have shared.
For almost 20 centuries, this civilisation has been the central and the lasting component of the European legacy.
One has to ask: would Europe would be the Europe it is today if, in the seventh and eighth centuries, the ashes of ancient Rome had been conquered and settled not by Christian societies but by Muslim and any other?
The simple answer is no.
It would not be Europe.
It would be Egypt or Libya.
Fortunately, there are people who will not accept cultural rights as a cover for Sharia.
Religion should be protected from the State - the European State, in particular.
It is only Christianity that can integrate other religions into a shared European project, by acknowledging what secular ideologies cannot.
I believe that Europe can do that and Europeans should recommit themselves to Christian culture and the traditions and values of liberty, equality, law and individual rights that, for over 20 centuries, have been embraced by Europeans of all nations and that have been the source of prosperity and moral leadership in the world.
This report can integrate nobody and nothing.
It is a symbol of dead men walking.
It might create a continent of zombies, unaware of their national identities.
<D>
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, since 2003 Sudan has been a battleground due to religious and ethnic differences.
The conflict in Darfur resulted in the exodus of over two and half million people.
Civilian victims of this conflict have been murdered, beaten and raped.
There is widespread hunger and there is a lack of basic hygiene.
Children, orphaned, lost, have no possibility of education or a decent future.
Ever more restrictions are placed on humanitarian missions.
The Sudanese conflict has resulted in a breakdown of civilisation in Darfur and Chad.
The Sudanese government has refused to cooperate with the International Criminal Court, derides the ICC, which issued arrest warrants for war criminals and is unable, or just does not want to, remedy the situation.
Following the attack on Omdurman on 10 and 11 May, another 200 people lost their lives.
We call on the authorities in Sudan to start cooperating immediately with the International Criminal Court.
We expect the Council of Europe to take decisive steps to block access to European Union banks to those identified as financing conflict in Darfur and to freeze their assets.
<D>
Madam President, I, too, am pleased, just like our Commissioner, at the quality of our debate, which has demonstrated the genuine responsibility of our institutions in general.
This responsibility has also been expressed through the replies made by the Commissioner, the commitments made and reiterated through the various evaluation meetings arranged for February and June 2011.
Of course, I did not want one immediately as regards Pakistan.
I was, in point of fact, reminding you of our fundamental positions.
I also wanted to thank her for the willingness that she expressed in terms of reciprocal security, of replies to questions, of openness and cooperation, of adjustments and the fight against abuses and in terms of respect for these different legal circumstances.
Although these agreements rightly provide a legal framework for organising the facilitation of visas and readmission procedures, under exact and strict conditions, this must not be confused with the absolute necessity we also have of defining the terms and the parameters of a European right to asylum.
In conclusion, I believe that this policy is a little like the two-headed god, Janus Bifrons.
We have spoken about policy and about procedure.
As far as I am concerned, Janus represents two profiles, procedure and policy, of a single face.
It has a technical face, that of procedures, that of conditions of law and of respect, but it also has a political face characterised, as certain fellow Members have said, by consolidation, by cooperation, by an opening of the Union towards third countries, a sign of our values, but it is also a case of registering a form of response to Europeans' willingness to make this opening.
I should like to conclude by saying that we must balance these elements and do everything to make them clear to our citizens.
We need to make it clear to them what a three-month visa really is and hence avoid ambiguities and other misunderstandings that could arise.
I am counting on you, Commissioner.
<D>
Mr President, the regulation that is being discussed today has been largely disregarded by all the committees over a long period.
However, some people in this House have now woken up at the end of the process when the results are on the table.
Some of them have unfortunately not attended the debate, which is a pity because it would have been very interesting to hear their views.
As a former member, I have a clear memory of the spirit of the convention.
It called openly for the European Parliament to be given specific rights in several areas, to ensure that it remained credible in the context of the institutions and with regard to the citizens.
Despite the convention's demands, nothing was done.
The very tough negotiations which the Belgian Presidency had with the Council were what enabled important progress to be made.
I remember what Mr Lehne said.
It was a question of the permanent possibility of investigating whether the Commission had exceeded its powers.
Of course, some of the regulations are not exactly ideal, such as the international trade agreement, but nevertheless I agree with the outcome.
I would like to thank the Belgian Presidency.
It has made every effort to ensure that something was achieved.
I would also like to thank the rapporteur, who negotiated sympathetically and intelligently.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to say that this debate has clearly confirmed the importance of the peace process in Northern Ireland and that important lessons have been learned during this process.
The Commission will continue its contribution to consolidating the reconciliation process and will also facilitate the sharing of the lessons learned from the experience of peace-building with all other areas facing similar problems.
In these efforts, the support of the European Parliament will certainly matter very much.
I would like to make two further comments:
To Jean Marie Beaupuy, the task force for Northern Ireland has been established to enhance and facilitate the participation of the people of Northern Ireland in all European Union policies and also to better coordinate and to build more coherence between different processes contributing to the consolidation of the peace and reconciliation process.
The second comment is that in these efforts the Commission would also like to help people in Northern Ireland to reduce the existing dependency on the public sector, on state aid and on the reliance of support coming in the form of grants.
The conference which was mentioned by Bairbre de Brún was also exactly aiming at contributing to this process of bringing more private investment - a more vibrant private sector - to life in this part of the island.
Once again, thank you very much for all your comments.
<D>
Madam President, Commissioner, I should like to thank and congratulate you and Mr Saryusz-Wolski for your current work and achievements.
Allow me today to open a debate on a new proposal, not on a high commissioner but on a whole new issue.
Let us create a European fund for alternative energy resources.
You might be surprised at why I am speaking about this issue.
Have you ever heard about one terrific night in a frozen US in 1965 which led to the baby boom?
You must be able to recall early May 1986 - Chernobyl - hours, days and months afterwards.
And, Commissioner, you probably did not have the opportunity to land and stay in Kuwait in 1991 when 300 oilfields were burning.
These are all cases of a lack of energy security.
Why do we have this lack of energy security?
Because we do not have freedom of choice; we are heavily dependent.
As a granddaughter of the founder of ČEZ, I know that we can say that the Česká republika is no longer 'Česká', but 'ČEZká'!
When you asked for 2020 for 20% of renewables, Prime Minister Topolánek came to us and he told us, I could sign it because it is total nonsense.
With this approach, we will stay insecure because we will not have freedom of choice.
How to achieve it?
Of course, not only by external diversification - we Europeans have to find our own resources.
Therefore, using energy tariffs to create a European fund for alternative energy can help us, not to create another Lisbon Strategy for 2020, but to really reach such people as Topolánek and give us the ability to have new resources, so as not to be dependent.
<D>
rapporteur. - (HU) I would first of all like to address the Council, even though the State Secretary has had to leave.
I totally agree with his statement that there is a problem.
I also entirely agree that everything he considers important Parliament also considers important, such as education and research.
There is also a great deal of consensus on the objectives.
However, there is a large gap when it comes to the means to be used.
We somehow have to reach a consensus on this by the middle of November.
The Commissioner mentioned that he welcomed steps Parliament was taking to restore lines featuring in the Commission's preliminary budget.
I would ask him to realise that this does not happen in a few lines.
In fact, I mentioned that we tried to adopt a position using a nuanced approach.
However, I must mention a few ideas expressed during the debate which I do not agree with.
I cannot accept the attitude that we describe as theft the amounts being transferred from one contributing country to another beneficiary country as a gesture of solidarity.
I do not think that this is what the issue is about here.
The European Union has been built on the basis that members show solidarity to each other.
In fact, I know of a contributing country whose leaders say that their revenue has substantially increased thanks to enlargement which has granted them access to a huge market.
The European Union cannot be measured in terms of the ratio of payments to contributions.
This is spurious and misleading, and it will ruin our whole common future.
At the same time, I would like to draw my fellow Members' attention to the fact that some people here very enthusiastically referred to each proposal in the past tense: we raised and arranged it, and this is the way it will be.
What we will vote on now on Thursday is a draft and a political message.
The political message is about how this Parliament would like to lead the European Union to greener pastures.
I also ask the Council to realise that what the rapporteur represents is not an individual's opinion, nor is it the opinion of a party, or only the opinion of the Committee on Budgets.
So many people have spoken here from different committees and different political groups, but all with the same message: we need a better, more practical and more powerful budget.
My time has run out.
Thank you for your respectful attention.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the resolution is the most positive achievement since the ceasefire agreement and contains most of the demands made by Elmar Brok and myself, on behalf of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, after our visit to Georgia.
However, this is not enough.
The European Union still has a role to play and our credibility is at stake.
The resolution must be followed by resolute joint action, as Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner has made clear with her encouraging statement today.
We must implement this resolution down to the last dot and comma, just as we are demanding Russia's full compliance, down to the last dot and comma, with the six-point plan.
What is more, over recent weeks, we have seen how important the European Union is and can be, but we have also seen where our weaknesses lie and where we have to take action - including preventive action - to remedy them.
Yes, we can be mediators, but if that is what we want, we must have a common European foreign policy, a pro-active foreign, security and defence policy.
We have also felt acutely, over recent weeks, the lack of a common position - indeed, the lack of political will to achieve a common position - and, even now, the lack of a shared resolve.
The absence of the Lisbon Treaty is weakening us.
Reconstruction is not enough.
We must invest in these countries' independence and cut the ground away from nationalism.
Engagement by the EU is more important than the prospect of NATO membership.
Commissioner, you have said, very eloquently, that there can be no more 'business as usual' towards Russia, and that our policy needs to be reappraised.
We must invest in economic, democratic, social and educational stability.
It is not just about money.
We must also expand our Neighbourhood Policy and put forward practical projects such as those you have announced today.
We look forward to that.
<D>
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Mr President, my group is not against the debate that is being held today per se, but we do have a great deal of difficulty with summarising the result of this debate in a resolution.
It gives the impression that we can lay down in a resolution how we should deal with Europe's history, and specifically with the totalitarian past.
As was apparent in the negotiations that have just taken place, they were all too quickly bogged down by what wordings we could or could not use in such a resolution.
Let us, please, leave it to historians to decide how precisely our history should be interpreted, knowing that objectivity is impossible.
Obviously, politicians can help ensure that sufficient attention is paid to the past, and that certainly also applies to the crimes perpetrated by Hitler and Stalin.
Those crimes must never be forgotten and we must honour the victims.
We must also all be aware that our fellow Europeans in Central and Eastern Europe suffered under two totalitarian systems and that that is not the experience of people like me, born, as I was, in the Netherlands.
Mr Geremek, a former Member of this House, quite correctly once commented that we have not yet achieved the reunification of our memories.
As politicians, we have a responsibility when it comes to organising what it is that we want to commemorate specially, but let us do that in collaboration with historians.
A day of commemoration for all the victims of the totalitarian systems in Europe in the 20th century is a good suggestion in itself, but let us work with historians to consider what the proper format and the right date for such a day should be so that everyone can support it.
I, myself, am a historian.
I think that if we were to link the day solely to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact it would not do justice to everything that happened in the 20th century.
It is important to debate this.
What are the dividing lines between politicians and historians?
What do we want to commemorate, and how?
The debate will undoubtedly rumble on.
We, as a group, will certainly get involved.
As an example of that, I want to show you this book, which will be coming out in two weeks' time under the title The politics of the past, the use and abuse of history and in which we especially left the floor to historians, and we hope that this will really contribute to the quality of the debate in this Parliament and, of course, elsewhere.
<D>
Mr President, last week, the Irish people, by a victory of 619 000 votes, gave a resounding vote of confidence in the European Union project.
I would like to thank the other 26 governments in Europe and the political groups in this Parliament who worked very closely with the Irish Government over the past 15 months so that the concerns expressed by the Irish people in the Lisbon Treaty I were comprehensively addressed.
This was a victory for the Irish people, not necessarily for the government or political parties.
The Irish people overwhelmingly said that Ireland's place lies at the heart of the European Union.
(GA) The political parties that were in favour of the treaty worked together this time round to a greater extent than during the last referendum.
Civic groups such as Ireland for Europe and We Belong played a central role in showing the public that it was not just the political system that wanted the people of Ireland to vote yes in the referendum.
Farming groups were strongly in favour of the treaty and they were very active in this campaign.
This is a major change from the last referendum, and it was clear to be seen.
The legally binding guarantees for Ireland in the policy areas of taxation, neutrality and socio-ethical issues clarified key concerns of the Irish people.
I hope that the Treaty will now be ratified shortly, and I am pleased to hear the news from you, Mr President, about your country.
But I would have to say that the remarks made here this afternoon by Mr Farage from the UKIP party were insulting to the Irish people and we will not accept that.
The Irish people are an intelligent, discerning electorate and they knew the difference between the last Treaty and this Treaty, that the protocols have legally binding agreement.
Mr Farage, you and your colleagues will be pleased to know that your intervention in the Treaty meant about 3 or 4% extra for the 'yes' side.
That is the respect that the Irish people have for you and your group.
<D>
You say you mean to remain vigilant, but I think that is rather insufficient.
We believe that the position of General Motors in Europe is unacceptable.
General Motors is counting on securing State aid from several national and regional governments in the European Union, one of the intended purposes of which is to cover the social costs of the closure of the Antwerp plant to which you refer.
This kind of thing is unacceptable, Commissioner: unacceptable both to the workers and to Europe.
In our opinion, this dossier is a very important test for you, a very important test of the credibility of the European Commission.
We cannot allow such things, as this would set a huge precedent for other dossiers in future.
Commissioner, this is an example of the protectionism that keeps rearing its ugly head, and it is unacceptable.
It undermines the foundations of the EU and, moreover, it is always the smaller countries who have to suffer, as this case has proven once again.
In the last few months, the EU governments have let themselves be divided like altar boys, as it were, by the Americans of General Motors, and it is clear that this cannot be repeated.
It can be prevented only by means of a common European approach.
In today's German press, your colleague, Neelie Kroes, the Commissioner for Competition, says that State aid in the automobile sector is possible only if this aid is channelled towards the development of innovative and environmentally friendly products.
We agree with this, but it is much better that such things be coordinated at European level than, as is currently happening, that they be the subject of separate negotiations between the various European countries and General Motors, as this is a road to nowhere.
Besides, making a single, joint European offer to General Motors would put us in a much stronger position, of course, and also enable us to demand guarantees in the social field - which must surely be close to your heart - and the employment field.
After all, why should it not be possible to open up new prospects for the workers at the relevant Opel plant in Antwerp, and naturally also for the workers at the other Opel plants in Europe who have been affected?
It is not yet too late for this, Commissioner Špidla.
We believe that, in the case of such cross-border restructuring operations, the European Commission itself must take the bull by the horns and set to work on a proactive policy instead of just watching and waiting.
What does this mean in specific terms?
It means launching a common strategy, taking much more dynamic action and, primarily, making much more vigorous use of all the European instruments at our disposal and combining them, instead of acting in disarray as we are doing at present.
In my opinion, we have been far too soft in our action on this dossier up to now.
The European Commission stood by as General Motors triumphed.
This has to change, in the interests of the workers, as they are the ones to suffer from the current lack of European political will.
My second point is just as important, Commissioner.
Today, the European Ministers for Industry are meeting in Spain to launch a European action plan for the automobile sector.
I believe we have an urgent need for this.
You, the European Commission, must bring together the major industry actors to ensure that our automobile sector, too, does not become swamped with Chinese products in the near future.
This coming Thursday, the Heads of State or Government of the European Union are meeting for an extraordinary European summit in Brussels at the instigation and on the invitation of our President Herman Van Rompuy.
There is just one item on the agenda: the enhancement of European economic cooperation.
Commissioner, let us begin with the automobile sector, as this is and remains our most important industry.
It is a real pacesetter for economic renewal, and has the potential to be a powerful force for employment.

(LT) I must commend Mr Sacconi regarding the significant additions to the Commission's timely Green Paper on the issue of climate change.
Some countries, mainly Nordic, have already developed a long-term strategy for dealing with climate change without any encouragement from Brussels, foreseeing actions to be taken in reaction to climate change: protecting coastal areas, taking measures against coastal flooding, building specially designed houses.
The adoption of the White Paper will encourage other countries to follow their example.
The EU countries with sea and ocean borders - and there are 22 of them - should meanwhile study the experience of the Netherlands in resisting the sea.
Half of the country's territory is below sea level.
The ongoing efforts of the Dutch people to resist assaults from the sea and the enormous resources they are directing towards protection against them have not prevented them from creating one of the world's strongest and most flourishing states.
Therefore, it proves that the possibility to adapt does exist.
At the recent meeting of the EU Council it was declared that the issue of climate change would be of the greatest importance in the preparation of the EU's prevention and protection policy.
Conflicts and wars to gain areas still suitable to live in as well as those providing water and food should be prevented before it is too late.
This particularly concerns the poorest countries of the world, which have contributed the least to climate change.
Those that have progressed at the expense of others should pay back their debt without delay.
In future the EU should continue to provide leadership to other continents and states in setting an example of how to adopt measures to prevent climate change, adapt to new conditions and transform the habits and practices of their citizens.

A common immigration policy based on facilitating the opening up of legal immigration channels cannot receive our support.
The policy should be the polar opposite of this.
This report is based, once again, on the dangerous recommendations of the Commission that appear in the latter's Green Paper of 11 January 2005 devoted to economic migration.
It is a report that puts the number of migrant workers that the EU will supposedly need by 2050 at 60 million and that accordingly stresses the need to open up channels for legal migration.
How can one fail to find it obscene that, in the midst of an economic, financial and social crisis, we are being recommended to open up our markets further to foreign workers, at a time when our national jobs are under threat and unemployment is raging?
In the midst of a crisis, what is needed, instead, is to apply economic and social protectionist measures and to reserve jobs, but social aid too, for nationals.
To conclude, this report is based on the false assumption that, by opening the floodgates for legal immigration, illegal immigration will fall considerably or disappear altogether.
We know that no such thing will happen and that, on the contrary, legal immigration is the forerunner of full-scale immigration.
<D>
(RO) First of all, I congratulate Rapporteur Rübig and I would like to specify certain elements.
For the economic competitiveness of the European Union, it is essential to support small and medium-sized enterprises investing in applied research.
The 22 Member States and the 5 states in Eureka that have decided to invest, together with the Commission, the 400 million euros to support the research carried out by small businesses, contribute to the achievement of the Lisbon Strategy objectives.
We should not forget that the SMEs represent 99% of the total European enterprises.
The selection of projects to be financed by the Eurostars programme shall be made according to the scientific excellence and economic impact.
Nevertheless, I call attention to the difficulty that small and medium-sized enterprises meet in ensuring the co-financing of 50% of a project's value.
Many of the small enterprises would rather assign their specialists to projects bringing rapid income, to the detriment of long-term research programmes.
Also, the financing of small businesses based on a business plan might determine a very large number of SMEs participating in the European research.
I hope that, during this programme, the Erasmus programme for young entrepreneurs will also continue.
<D>
The communication proposal for restoring European citizens' trust in the Single Market, drafted by the Commission, is slightly unclear when examining it in correlation with the EU 2020 strategy.
Many of the proposals featuring in it overlap with various other initiatives.
In these circumstances, more consistency, greater effectiveness and better governance are required for a renewed Single Market to foster, within the EU, economic growth, employment and competitiveness, as well as respect for the rights of citizens and consumers.
The Council and Member States have to support together the European and national commitment to deepening and strengthening the Single Market.
Efforts to achieve the Single Market have been concentrated on its organisation and too little on the concerns and rights of citizens, workers and consumers, which might explain European citizens' reluctance and lack of enthusiasm towards the internal market.
Citizens need to feature at the heart of the Single Market.
This point is clearly stated in the document's introduction.
On the other hand, the proposals to attain this objective are too weak to achieve it.
The Grech report, adopted by Parliament in May 2010, recommended a holistic approach to relaunching and strengthening the internal market, encompassing key sectors such as industry, energy and infrastructure.
<D>
rapporteur. - (NL) Madam President, if this directive meets with approval this afternoon, although we may be laying down a directive for only a small segment of the internal market, it will represent an enormous step for the European consumer.
This directive is, after all, a precursor to the horizontal instrument for consumer protection.
As rapporteur, I proposed in the first instance that we lay down a number of aspects in a regulation.
We eventually ended up with maximum harmonisation and, in my view, this maximum European harmonisation will provide considerable protection not only for consumers, but also for the bona fide companies involved in the trade in question.
Tourism will receive an enormous boost, and the internal market can only function well if there is consumer confidence.
I am glad that, with this maximum harmonisation, all European consumers will be given the same rights.
Indeed, I take the view that the European consumers, from whichever country they may hail, should have the same rights when they purchase goods, services or whatever else within the internal market.
This will be guaranteed with this directive.
I hope that the Member States will regulate adherence and their monitoring procedures in the same way, so that consumer confidence can remain high.
After all, an internal market, and this is why I believe in Europe, can only function well on the basis of trust on the part of industry, the government and the consumer.
If we manage to pull this off, then this is a precursor to my mind, and an important indicator that the horizontal instrument for consumer protection should be fully harmonised for all consumer purchases.
This then, in my opinion, is a huge step forward, for we have already optimised many areas of the internal market, but not yet consumer confidence.
I think that this directive is an important step in that direction.
I should like to thank everyone who has made a positive contribution.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I am pleased to be here tonight to represent the Commission in this very important discussion on consumer confidence in the internal market.
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Lehtinen, and the shadow rapporteurs of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection for their very ambitious work in drafting this report.
I should stress at the outset that the Commission agrees with the report regarding the need to increase consumer confidence in the internal market; in particular, the consumer internal market for services demands our attention.
So, one of the Commission's priorities is to bring the benefits of the internal market closer to our European consumers and I am grateful for the support of the Parliament in this endeavour.
The Commission has already undertaken a number of initiatives in order to boost consumer confidence in the internal market.
I would like to mention two: European consumer protection legislation and the Services Directive.
Now, the consumer acquis already sets out a number of obligations for cross-border service providers.
For instance, it regulates the information obligations for traders who sell services long distance or on the consumers' doorstep.
It also provides consumers with protection against unfair terms in services contracts.
And, with the ongoing review of this acquis, the Commission will elaborate if there is further need to address the obligations of service providers and the rights of consumers in these areas.
Then, the Services Directive: you know it very well, you discussed it not long ago.
It improves the position of consumers within the internal market for services.
And it ensures that consumers will be better informed by businesses, better assisted by public authorities, and it establishes a number of clear and substantive obligations on service providers.
The Commission of course is very keen to ensure proper implementation of this Directive in all Member States and we believe that those two initiatives are very far-reaching because we can, from both of those initiatives, expect a real change in the consumer internal market for services once the implementation of the Services Directive is complete and the review of the consumer acquis delivers its results.
Having said that, I have also to underline that the Commission takes a different view to Mr Lehtinen's report on the need for a separate horizontal instrument to cover obligations of cross-border service providers at this stage for the simple reason that we believe that we should first accomplish our ongoing initiatives before coming, if necessary, to a separate horizontal instrument.
That is why I would like to thank you for your commitment towards helping us implement these two instruments; in also helping European citizens to enjoy the full benefits of the internal market for services.
And I know that my colleagues, Commissioner Kuneva and Commissioner McCreevy, look forward to discussing with you, working with you, to establish this internal market together with Parliament, which is the real representative of the European citizens.
So, thank you for your collaboration, thanks for this openness and I am sure that my two colleagues - and, indeed, the whole Commission - will, in a very deep way, continue to work together with Parliament.
<D>
in writing. - I would like to draw attention to the fact that the economic crisis in the car industry in the Maltese Islands is being compounded because of a serious administrative blunder.
Cars in Malta are subject to a heavy registration tax, on which the Government was also collecting VAT.
It has now been established that the Government was appropriating money from thousands of car owners which was not due.
The Government is refusing to reimburse thousands of vehicle owners who have paid substantial amounts when these were not due.
The Government of Malta is claiming that reimbursement will amount to millions of Euros.
It is exactly because of this that the Government has a duty and an obligation to return taxes irregularly imposed.
This is such a serious blunder that if it happened in any other member state of the EU, the Government would have been forced to resign.
In Malta the Government has not even had the decency to accept responsibility and apologize to the thousands of Maltese and Gozitans who have been affected.
Solutions could be found by offering rebates to the owners of these vehicles on such issues as annual licences.
It appears that the Government is completely deaf to any such suggestions.
<D>
Madam President, first I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Klinz, for his own-initiative report and also for taking on board all the proposals and opinions of the other groups.
Harmonising the environment for asset management and products on the fund market can bring huge benefits to the European economy, as proven also by the 1985 UCITS Directive.
The UCITS Directive has become a huge brand globally.
It sells well abroad.
UCITS represent the basis for a robust fund market in Europe and they make the economy more buoyant through increased stability and the productive reinvestment of savings.
However, the topic of this report is not the UCITS revision, which is forthcoming and which we welcome.
The report addresses, instead, non-harmonised retail funds that are outside the scope of UCITS, calling for a number of important measures.
I would particularly like to welcome the private placement regime, which was also mentioned by the Commissioner.
Initiative is very instrumental in achieving the European market in non-harmonised funds.
Second, fee transparency is a long-due and underrated feature for increasing investor information.
Other measures in the report go in the right direction as well, removing market distortions.
However - and coming back to UCITS' success - we must not get greedy here or mix things up hastily.
I am, of course, referring to the debate on extending UCITS' scope to new asset classes such as open-ended real estate funds or funds of hedge funds.
I do not think the time is right now to discuss these sensitive matters.
We might end up with a more rigid regime, and we would probably find ourselves in a different financial market environment.
I also think it is very important to discuss the role of guaranteed funds.
There is no such thing as a guaranteed fund.
Our group wanted to have some flexibility.
We do not think that having a capital adequacy regime for funds solves the problem.
Guaranteed funds do not exist, and this kind of definition should be removed from the regime.
That is why we have both put forward a proposal from the PPE-DE Group.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - In answer to the first question, the Commission has proposed two new directives in order to solve these problems because the financial crisis has highlighted the problems more clearly than before.
We made a proposal at the end of 2008 and another one at the beginning of 2009, the former reinforcing the information exchange and the latter enshrining the right of a Member State to obtain information without the other Member State invoking banking secrecy.
As for the second question I just want to underline that lorries have nothing to do with tax havens.
Subject: The Internet and hate crimes
Incitement to racial hatred is a crime in all EU Member States.
However, according to the 2008 Hate Crime Survey published by the NGO Human Rights First, hate crimes are on the rise in Europe, and it is important to see the central role that the Internet plays in this.
As part of its aim to fight cybercrime and create a safer Internet for all, is the Commission taking any specific action to help combat websites which incite racial hatred and violence?
<D>
(PL) Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner and our rapporteur for a splendid draft, which I fully support.
It amounts to a very good signal on the part of the European Union.
I refer to the willingness to support developing countries, and also to combat climate change.
I do, however, have the following question for the Commissioner.
How does the Commission intend to prevent deforestation, which is often linked to the production of biomass and biofuels in developing countries?
Moreover, is the Commission keeping a suitable distance from the production of first generation biomass and biofuels, as it is well know that this is not the a particularly safe matter?
I would like to offer my strong support for the statement by Mr Chatzimarkakis.
The European Union has to send out a signal of this type.
We are responsible for the conferences on climate change due to take place in Poznań and Copenhagen in the near future, and for the success of the post-Kyoto negotiations.
We are also responsible for sending out the right signals to the rest of the world.
This programme represents just such a signal.
<D>
, in writing. - (HU) As President of the Intergroup for National Minorities, I welcome Mrs Lynne's report, which takes stock of what has already been achieved with regard to freedom from discrimination, and outlines what needs to be done.
Community legislation on freedom from discrimination is especially important because protecting the individual is not enough.
People do not suffer discrimination as individuals, but as members of a group: for example, because they belong to an ethnic minority, because they are old, because they are women, because they have a disability, because they belong to a sexual minority, or because they are Roma.
For this reason, the only way of effectively protecting individuals belonging to the various minority groups is by protecting the whole group.
The report rightly points out that the two existing directives only lay down minimum requirements, and so we need to take matters further towards developing a Community-level policy against negative discrimination and a horizontal anti-discrimination directive.
Likewise very important is the item in the report calling on the Commission to work towards establishing a common, EU-wide definition of the term 'positive action'.
The report also draws particular attention to the need for specific social protection for minority communities, and especially the Roma community.
In this context I would like to remind you of Article 25 of the Ždanoka report, also on this topic, which points out the importance of participation by traditional national minorities in policy-making.
According to this article, national minorities need a framework policy standard enabling them to participate effectively in decision-making processes concerning their identity by means of various forms of self-government or autonomy.
<D>
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (ES) Mr President, I would also like to begin by thanking Mrs Pack and congratulating her on her report - because of her willing attitude most of the amendments tabled by our Group were also incorporated into it.
I would like to say that adult education has always been one of the best ways both to effect social and economic development and to contribute to better wealth distribution.
Now, in this changing information society where we must continually update our knowledge, the initial basic education of adults, and subsequent ongoing training, is a need of the first order.
Adults must adapt to the continuous change imposed by globalisation and take decisions in order to be able to survive while maintaining an adequate quality of life.
However, most educational systems do not respond sufficiently to people's requirements in such a way as to be able to keep sufficiently abreast of the changing society in which they live.
In contrast to previous eras, the role of education is not to obtain lessons to be applied in a known world, but in a world of continuous change which may produce unforeseeable circumstances.
The point is therefore to provide a system of education which can respond to the needs of adults in a society undergoing permanent change.
In short, education must prepare people for looking ahead and for innovation and must no longer concern itself with just fitting in.
We are in transit between an industrial and post-industrial society, and the type of society towards which we are moving will form the framework for adult education; on that point I have congratulated the rapporteur and would also like to congratulate the Commission because I believe that the current report is in that vein.
<D>
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - Mr President, the Lisbon Treaty will be subjected to the democratic scrutiny of the people in Ireland alone.
There is clearly a fear of referendums in other states, and I find myself asking why.
Why so, when we talk so much about democracy?
Who here fears the voice of the people?
In this Chamber, we speak the language of peace, and yet Lisbon commits us to further increases in Union military spending and to continuing support for the armaments industry in Europe.
Why do we insist on emulating the United States?
Do we really believe that creating its European equivalent will promote a peaceful world?
I do not.
We continue with the myth that the EU values public services and workers' rights, when all the evidence on the ground contradicts this.
Ask the people of Vaxholm or the workers of Irish Ferries about the EU's commitment to the vindication of workers' rights.
Why is it that we congratulate ourselves on being substantial donors of aid to developing countries and, at the same time, we devise partnership agreements that force poor countries to lay bare their markets to European economic ambition?
How can any of us here today who believe in democracy, peace or public services support the Lisbon Treaty?
This Treaty is not about reform or efficiency; it is a carte blanche for further erosion of democracy, and its self-amending clauses alone are evidence of this.
It is a charter for further privatisation.
It offers no advance on the environment, nothing new on the protection of workers' rights and it gives powerful EU institutions a free hand to further militarise our Union.
Would the people of Europe support such a Treaty?
I believe they would not, and perhaps that is why they are not being asked.
As an Irishwoman, as a proud European, I want my country to have the freedom to take decisions in the best interests of our people.
I want all Member States, large and small, to enjoy that right equally.
Collectively and democratically, we can bring about positive change, delivering for our people and delivering for the global village.
We need to reform the European Union to enable us to achieve these things, to create the Europe that our people want and deserve.
The Lisbon Treaty is a bad deal for Ireland, it is a bad deal for Europe and it is a bad deal for the wider world.
<D>
in writing. - I was in favour of the position that the EU milk market should be opened up more rapidly than planned in an existing draft proposal and voted for an increase of the milk quota, although an increase of 5% as demanded by Poland was not presented to plenary.
No majority for this proposal could be found in the EP.
Poland's restrictive milk quota threatens to transform the country from a net exporter of dairy products to a net importer within five to seven years.
The EU allocated Poland by far the largest quota offered to any of the 10 accession countries, representative of Poland's position as the EU-25's fourth largest milk producer when it joined the EU in May 2004.
Poland's quota, nevertheless, is seen as small relative to the larger quotas of Europe's top three milk producers - Germany, France and Britain.
The quotas are the legacy of bygone era when Europe's dairies produced infamous lakes of milk and the EU had to help to keep prices from collapsing.
The raising of the milk quota can be seen as the beginning of phasing out the quotas as the EU milk quota system is due to expire in 2015.
<D>
in writing. - I congratulate my colleague Marco Cappato on a comprehensive report, pointing out the most burning issues in the field of human rights last year.
I agree with him fully on the need for a radical intensification of the EU-China human rights dialogue especially in the light of the upcoming Olympics in Beijing.
It is regrettable that China has not significantly enhanced the situation of human rights in the country after Beijing was granted in 2001 the right to organise the Olympics.
But this should definitely not be a reason to give up on China.
As the report states, the Olympics 'constitute an important historic opportunity for the improvement of human rights in China' and therefore we should tirelessly remind the Chinese authorities of the promises they have made.
But we should avoid making threats that might lead to some greater isolation and restiveness in China, as has happened recently, causing several anti-Western demonstrations in the country.
We must be careful not to create an opposition to democratic reforms among the Chinese people.
Instead we should concentrate on creating a dialogue that would give us a chance to present our position while not treating the other party with disdain.
<D>
Today's Europe is faced with unprecedented demographic changes.
If Europe wishes to change the trend towards population reduction, we must, through the policy of the EU and the Member States, support families in all possible ways, and permit women and men to combine family life and work, but such that obligations connected with home and family are equally divided between men and women.
I wholeheartedly support the alternative motion for a European Parliament resolution on non-discrimination based on gender and inter-generational solidarity, which is more realistic than the preceding report.
I must particularly emphasise the objective of creating a care policy that is balanced between the genders.
Inequality in the performance of caring is often caused by the absence of affordable, available and high-quality services in Member States, and women are faced with the inevitability of sacrificing their opportunities to participate in social, economic and political life.
All of this preserves the inequality in the distribution of obligations connected with home and family between men and women, which generally forces women to choose a more flexible organisation of labour or give up working, which in turn influences their career, the continuing disparity between the wages earned by women and men, and pension rights.
I am cautious of the recommendation of the Czech Presidency to make childcare 'a fully valid alternative to a professional career'.
I am convinced that the implementation of this recommendation would perpetuate the traditional division of labour between men and women.
The measures planned in the framework of the Lisbon Strategy play an important role in establishing equality in the division of labour between women and men; their objective, in addition to increasing employment, promoting innovation and raising productivity, must also be to eliminate in the EU the gender discrimination that has developed over time.
<D>
Mr President, the neighbourhood and partnership instrument needs to be revised so as to secure simpler procedures and, at the same time, improve transparency.
The basis for the European neighbourhood policy is the creation of a climate of trust in the immediate vicinity of the European Union.
It is in everyone's interest for there to be stronger economic growth and stability in all neighbouring countries, both to the east and in the Mediterranean area.
However, criteria and approaches specific to each country need to be defined, depending on its political priorities in terms of human rights, democracy, the rule of law, minority rights and so forth.
It is also important for Community aid to reach all the interested groups of citizens.
That is why the capabilities of the neighbourhood instrument need to be promoted in the right way.
In order for these ambitious targets to be achieved, the distribution of funds between the countries of Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean countries needs to be equally weighted, as provided for under the financial framework for 2007-2013.
The Barcelona process should be supplemented by the European neighbourhood policy and the objectives must be clearly defined.
At this time in particular, with the economic crisis now affecting all the countries which benefit from the neighbourhood instrument, it must be made clear that the European Union is helping to address the crisis through this financial aid.
That is why the European Commission should publish evaluations on this question.
Finally, I should like to mention the Black Sea Synergy: this region needs to be included in the European neighbourhood policy.
The support being given by the European Union to this regional cooperation must target the production of tangible results in certain priority sectors such as energy, transport, immigration and the fight against organised crime.
<D>
Mr President, Commissioner, the European Parliament and the Council have approved the extension of ENISA's operation until the end of 2012.
This three-year extension will enable further debate on the future of ENISA and the wider question of increased security of networks and information in Europe.
In my view, the revision procedure ought to begin immediately.
It should transform the body from a temporary foundation into a permanent one; above all, this must be accompanied by a simultaneous increase in staff and an updating of the extremely important Articles 2 and 3 in its Rules of Procedure.
This solution will allow the body to get to work as soon as possible under an upgraded and improved mandate.
Let me remind you here - and this is the Commission's view, too - that only a European agency can guarantee the security of networks and information.
I should also like to point out that today the overwhelming majority of partners agree that ENISA is the most able and qualified body to develop a new, dynamic European policy for the security of networks and information.
In the past, ENISA was harshly criticised.
I must remind you, however, that the evaluation report in 2007 was able to evaluate ENISA only in its first year of operation; as a result, the evaluation is no longer reliable or, of course, timely.
Recent evaluation studies by independent bodies have restored the truth.
It is essential for appropriate resources to be made available so that the body can operate more effectively.
Finally, let me tell you that the Greek Government wishes to support a viable solution: it has undertaken to cover the maintenance expenses of an ENISA office in Athens in order to facilitate the body's work and operations.
<D>
Madam President, I want to raise a related matter.
The Commission will know that three 'F' gases are among the six major greenhouse gases.
I was rapporteur on the Mobile Air Conditioning (MAC) Directive relating to their use in mobile air conditioning.
It would appear that loopholes are being exploited between that legislation and type approval legislation, which was the tool chosen to implement the directive.
I have been alerted over the last few weeks to plans by car manufacturers to avoid any refrigerant change at all, in 2011 and beyond, by applying type approval of certain components.
This would mean that the deadline for prohibition of the use of R134a would now be 2017 rather than 2011.
Hence, the avoidance of tonnes of CO2 equivalent emissions will no longer happen.
National type approval authorities are ultimately responsible for the implementation of the MAC Directive.
For example the VCA, which is the type approval authority in the UK, has recently stated that it will approve, after January 2011, new types of vehicles fitted with existing - already approved to Regulation (EC) No 706/2007 standards - MACs containing 'F' gases with a GWP greater than 150.
As a consequence, we have evidence of car manufacturers delaying - if not stopping altogether - development and investment in innovative sustainable technology.
Can the Commissioner please comment?
<D>
(NL) Mr President, the EU Member States have, by way of reaction to the unilateral territorial division of Georgia under Russian supervision, not closed ranks.
Once again, we have not seen any evidence of a joint, let alone firm, European response to the Kremlin's power machinations.
The crucial question therefore remains: what does the Union mean by a strategic partnership with the Russian Federation?
In other words, is Moscow really an indispensable partner for Brussels, or am I touching a political nerve in Europe by saying this?
After all, the fact of the matter is that Russia has, to date, sabotaged an effective international answer to the Iranian and North Korean nuclear programmes.
At the same time, Moscow has not exactly shown itself to be an indispensable partner in the bloody fight against Islamic terrorism, for example on the Afghan front, either.
Only in the area of energy do the cold numbers suggest there is probably a strategic, even indispensable, partnership between the European Union and Russia: today, the 27 EU Member States rely on Russian oil and gas exports to a level of about 70%.
For its own good, though, the EU should run down this considerable dependence as quickly as possible.
After all, Moscow admits that its energy reserves will be exhausted in 10 to 15 years' time.
Council and Commission, where is your strategy of energy diversification now?
Surely the new Turkmen discovery of gas should galvanise you into action.
<D>
Madam President, as we come to the first stage of the 2010 budget, I would like to congratulate both rapporteurs.
It is clear - and other speakers have mentioned it - that we will be having a different type of debate this autumn because we now have the context of a European election set in the worst economic conditions for the last 60 years.
I suspect, therefore, Mr Surján, that when it comes to looking at the budget this autumn - and you have set out traditional challenges in this document - that these will be much changed by the debates we are going to have, focusing on where we are going to be, creating new jobs for the future rather than looking backwards.
The emphasis will be on the things in your document, such as green technologies, zero carbon technologies, and, above all, on seeing how ICT, can foster innovation and be able to get the new growth that the European economy will need.
Mr Maňka, in the budget for the European Parliament, when we are thinking about the screening process which has just been mentioned, please do not forget the role of technologies and the way in which everything can be done in a much simpler way.
We do not need traditional ways of doing things: we need to be thinking of the new ways in which we can communicate with our citizens.
I suspect that by the end of the next Parliament every parliamentarian bar one or two will have a blog.
There are over 100 million blogs in the global system today; there were no blogs when this Parliamentary term started in 2004.
We have to keep our minds tuned to the future rather than trampling along the normal ways we are used to in so many contexts.
Lastly, I very strongly support Mr Surján's proposal because it refers in both budgets to what I call 'value for money' and which others call 'qualitative improvement' of the way in which we spend it.
The economic recession will be very tough on us and we will have to be able to justify the monies we are spending.
I would like to thank the Commissioner for everything that she has done during her term of office with regard to being able to monitor how spending is done.
If, for the new incoming Parliament, there could be an analysis of those lines which are strong and those which are weak, then that would be very welcome.
<D>
Today's vote on the European citizens' initiative is a milestone for more democracy in Europe.
I welcome the compromise and I will support it, because the report produced by Mr Lamassoure and Mrs Gurmai is the first step in the right direction.
Ladies and gentlemen, we must not be afraid of citizens having more opportunities to express their will.
We must give the citizens of Europe more codecision rights, not just every five years at the European elections.
This needs courage, stamina and strength.
Courage to keep returning to the dialogue.
Stamina, because decisions cannot necessarily be made more quickly and strength because our representative democracy includes, at last, in my opinion, more participative elements.
Our goal must be to increase the dialogue in Europe between the citizens and the politicians.
I am pleased that we are moving one step closer to the Europe of the citizens today with the European citizens' initiative.
I am convinced that one day we Europeans will take joint European decisions, in the form of citizens' decisions.
<D>
Providing consumers with information about food is undoubtedly important.
However, the debate in Brussels has become a lobbying battle between large companies from the food industry and consumer protection organisations.
There was no place in this debate for the reality of everyday life for consumers.
The representatives of the German Free Democratic Party in the European Parliament are in favour of a minimum of labelling.
Consumers should be able to make their purchasing decisions on the basis of transparent, legible information.
Colour coded labelling influences consumers and does not form the basis for transparent information.
The so-called guideline daily amounts (GDAs) also have their weak points.
Instead of having neutral information about the amounts of nutrients per 100 grams or millilitres printed legibly on packaging, Parliament discussed whether the daily requirements of a 40-year-old woman could be used as the point of reference or whether the colour coding of nutrients was a useful decision-making tool.
The proposed, far-reaching, mandatory requirements for the origin labelling of ingredients cannot be implemented in practice.
We have also rejected the idea of special national provisions, because the labelling system should, as far as possible, be standardised.
For these reasons, we were not able to vote in favour of the proposed report.
<D>
Madam President, when the proposal from the Commission was published it prompted a headline in a major Danish newspaper.
The front page of the newspaper read 'EU threatens Danish groundwater'.
In Denmark, we are very proud of the fact that we have a huge amount of clean groundwater that we can drink completely untreated.
Thus, the water that comes out of the tap is groundwater and we can drink it without having to treat it first.
If the Commission's proposal were to have been implemented as it was originally presented, it would have meant that in Denmark we would have roughly doubled the number of pesticides on the market.
This would very likely have also resulted in many of them seeping down into the groundwater - pesticides that we have currently declined to use because they would seep into the groundwater, with the effect that we would be unable to drink the water before it had been treated.
Clearly, it would have been a disaster if the Commission's original proposal had been adopted, and not only for Denmark.
Just as we, in my home country, have the groundwater that we want to look after, and that I choose to use as an example here, there are, of course, other countries with various other environmental and health-related matters that they would like to protect and the EU must never force a country to lower its level of protection.
I am therefore extremely pleased that we have succeeded - not as a result of the Commission, not as a result of the Council, but as a result of Parliament's efforts - in ensuring a flexibility which, where there are special considerations, allows individual countries to say 'no' to pesticides that they do not want, as of course should be the case.
Another very positive thing that I am extremely pleased we have adopted is that we will now have a ban on, and can phase out, some of the most dangerous substances contained in pesticides.
These are substances that have already been prohibited in other applications by means of the regulation, referred to as REACH, that we produced a couple of years ago.
These are substances that are so dangerous that we will not permit them in textiles, we will not permit them in electronic goods, we will not permit them in toys or in all manner of other applications, but they are still permitted in pesticides, which then end up in our food!
This is, of course, totally unacceptable and I am therefore extremely pleased that we will now be rid of these dangerous substances in pesticides.
A third thing that I would like to mention and that I think is extremely positive and something we can be pleased about is that we have now introduced reduction targets for the individual Member States.
We have introduced action plans through which the individual countries are to achieve both a qualitative and quantitative reduction in the use of pesticides.
Qualitative refers to the fact that there are clearly some substances that are more dangerous than others and we should, of course, be particularly careful with these substances, but it is also a good idea to reduce use in the quantitative sense, that is to say the overall use of pesticides, because this will obviously also result in a reduction in the use of these substances that end up in our countryside and in our food.
However, in conclusion I also have to say that there are things that could have been done much better.
Neurotoxic substances, for example.
These are substances that impair the development of children's brains.
The fact that we are not phasing these substances out is, in my opinion, unambitious and a shame.
I also think that it is a shame that we have included the possibility of exempting these dangerous substances if industry can demonstrate the need to do this.
I think that we should have been more ambitious.
However, when it comes to the bottom line, I am pleased and satisfied.
This is a victory for health and for the environment.
<D>
(DA) Mr President, EU transport policy is on the wrong track.
Broadly speaking, nothing is being done about the key problems: climate change, congestion and accidents.
It is as though we have become inured to congestion and accidents - but we cannot be content to inure ourselves to climate change once it has begun.
We have to act now.
Yet traditional thinking prevails every time, even in this otherwise excellent report - which includes the absurd proposal to allow the use of megaliners.
What would happen if we allowed the use of these juggernauts of up to 60 tonnes?
Would we have fewer lorries?
Of course not.
The gain from increasing the size of lorries would be eaten up by the increase in transport tonnage.
That is a law of nature; it is what happens when transport is cheaper.
Our roads would become full of these mobile warehouses, and neither 'intelligent' traffic management nor any other hocus-pocus would be of any help.
It would be like applying small sticking plasters to a gaping wound, which will just become larger and larger with the present transport policy.
Ladies and gentlemen, I urge you to vote against the megaliners in paragraph 21.
We cannot permit this kind of heavy goods vehicle in Europe.
We cannot make it cheaper to transport goods by road.
As mentioned earlier, this would undermine the competitiveness of maritime and rail transport: precisely the modes of transport that must be reinforced if we are ever to have sustainable freight transport in Europe.
<D>
in writing. - (PL) When it voted for compulsory unbundling of ownership of energy concerns in the European Union, the European Parliament took a decisive step towards creating a common market in electrical energy.
Dividing these concerns into companies responsible for energy production and companies responsible for its transmission is the only way to create an open and competitive market where there is no conflict of interest.
The consumer should be the main beneficiary of the proposed changes.
The proposal adopted significantly strengthens consumers' rights.
Inter alia, it gives consumers the right to withdraw from a contract with an electricity supplier without additional charges.
Consumers are also given the right to change their energy supplier in a very short time.
It should be borne in mind that the electricity market is currently dominated by monopolies that abuse their position on uncompetitive markets.
I believe that price caps will protect energy users from exploitation by energy concerns, without deterring new entities from entering the market.
Clearly, the solutions proposed will not resolve all the problems related to energy currently confronting us, such as the rise in oil prices.
Nonetheless, these solutions represent appropriate steps towards the development of a more competitive market.
The debate is to continue in the Council.
Unfortunately, however, it is unlikely that all of the European Parliament's proposals will be accepted.
As the rapporteur rightly pointed out, many Member States protect want to protect their own national interests.
<D>
(NL) Mr President, I shall be frank: I find it hard to give a coherent speech here after hearing what was said by the gentlemen on that side of the House.
This is something that particularly tugs at my heartstrings, including as a woman, as it also concerns me and the other women in this Chamber.
After all, what we are talking about is not a medical problem, nor a financial one (although I am grateful for assurances concerning increased funding); it is a social problem.
It is a problem concerning society's attitude towards women; a society that still regards women throughout the world as second-class citizens.
To be frank, I find it incredible that these two Members can say what they said, knowing that this costs the lives of half a million women each year.
It beggars belief.
There is not one woman who wants an abortion - not one!
If faced with no other choice, however, she must at least be able to have it done safely and legally.
This is a woman's right.
Incidentally, I am delighted that this has the support of the Council of Europe.
If we fail to recognise this right we are all just weeping crocodile tears here.
I would therefore appeal to everyone in this House to vote in favour of the amendments condemning the United States' 'global gag rule' and also the Vatican's ban on condoms - I shall just come out and say it - as these two things are directly responsible for millions of deaths and must, I believe, be condemned by this House.
<D>
rapporteur. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, in all sectors of transport there has long been careful investigation of the causes of serious transport accidents.
Individual Member States view such investigations and the determination of technical causes as an essential component of accident reduction.
The only exception up to now has been maritime transport.
There are of course some framework regulations, but maritime transport and shipping are far more complex than other types of transport when it comes to establishing which state is to be responsible for investigating the causes of accidents.
A ship owner need not be the operator of the ship and the two of them may come from different states.
The seafarers may be multiethnic and multinational.
Passengers may also be of different nationalities.
The same goes for the cargo and for the client commissioning the voyage.
A ship sails from a port in the territorial waters of one state to another, on the way passing through the territorial waters of other states or international waters.
As if this were not complex enough, some states have subordinated the investigative bodies we are calling for to different state organisations.
They are therefore not even organisationally independent.
The investigation of accidents in the field of maritime transport has been discussed with shadow rapporteurs and with the Presidency.
The Committee on Transport and Tourism decided that it is desirable to retain the basic outlines of the draft directive.
This involves standardised investigations in accordance with a common methodology, whereby deadlines for determining which state is going to conduct an investigation and for the submission of a final report must be laid down.
It is of course open to discussion as to what classes of accidents are to be compulsorily investigated in accordance with the methodology adopted and as to how precisely the organisational independence of the investigative body is to be defined.
During discussion of the materials, we reached agreement that the conclusions of a technical investigation may be used for further, for example criminal, investigations.
The details of a technical investigation must, however, remain confidential.
It was also clarified in committee that it is not possible to ignore the provisions requiring fair treatment of seafarers on ships which have been involved in maritime accidents, unless this is prevented by the inclusion of such provisions in other regulations.
There is also agreement that the independent investigative body must comprise experts from several countries and that individual states may reach mutual agreement on representation in the investigation of maritime accidents.
I should like to emphasise that one of the main aims of the maritime package under consideration is to strengthen the responsibility of the flag state.
It is therefore appropriate that the proposed wording relating to the rapid notification of technical shortcomings identified should remain part of the directive, as should specification of the ships to which the directive relates.
I do not think it would be a good idea, following the experiences with tanker accidents on the Spanish coast, for it still to be possible for several technical investigative bodies to be able to work in parallel.
If the European Commission does not feel itself to be sufficiently competent to decide on the conduct of investigations, then the only option is for such decisions to be taken in the European Council.
I certainly consider the launch of several parallel technical investigations to be a poor solution.
The still incomplete investigation into the accident involving the tanker Prestige shows where such a buck-passing dispersal of responsibility for an investigation leads.
It is right that the whole maritime package should be discussed at the same time, thus avoiding differences in the definitions of individual concepts in the various component directives and thus enhancing the clarity of the resultant materials.
I believe that, even with the directive on maritime disasters, we can reach a sensible compromise which will be practicable and will make a contribution to a reduction in the likelihood of occurrence of further maritime disasters and perhaps to a thorough re-examination, including of the technical aspects.
<D>
in writing. - Europe is not ready for the challenges posed by our demography.
For 60 years, Europe has put its trust in a pyramid scheme.
It works as long as every generation is much larger than the previous one.
But, today, European families are raising fewer children than their parents.
I would like to point out that in the 21st century the low birth rates present less of an economical danger than they did 60 years ago.
Progress of technology lets us produce much more goods with much less labour.
Globalisation means that the countries with young and growing populations will help us to carry the pension burden, if our policies allow it.
My country, Estonia, is a great example of a successful transition to a funded pension scheme.
At the same time, Estonia feels that low birth rates endanger the sustainability of our culture, maybe even nationhood.
This is the problem of many smaller nations.
If we want to preserve Europe as we know it, we must protect our cultures also by protecting our families.
We, the policymakers, must to make sure that technology and globalisation are our servants, not masters.
This report is a good start.
<D>
(IT) Mr President, Mr Andor, Mrs Vassiliou, ladies and gentlemen, we have set ourselves the goal of identifying the needs of the job market in the coming years.
This means we are speaking of the future of young Europeans, of the professions and the economies that will sustain our communities tomorrow.
For all too long, we have been wondering about the types of jobs that will be available in ten years, about how qualifications will change and about the skills required throughout the Union.
We ask ourselves continually whether the education and training currently offered to European citizens will help them find a job easily.
I wonder how the Commission actually intends to go about adopting new measures to achieve the goals it has set itself.
Are we sure we know all the needs of young people?
Are we sure that e-learning is the solution, or can we study new and more telling forms of education and training?
Only six months are left before the pilot project launched in May 2010 concludes, meaning it is already time to draw up budgets.
Will the results we achieve be positive?
Will they be encouraging?
We must aim to train young people using European educational policies that are capable of anticipating future needs.
Not long ago, I heard a long list of things we 'have to do'.
To use medical terminology, I have heard a lot about diagnosis but not a lot about the cure.
We must not be content with a lot of hot air but must work with substantial ideas, as the EU 2020 strategy demands.
This is the challenge that all Member States and enterprises must tackle and this is the best legacy that we can leave to our children.
<D>
in writing. - (PT) We recently saw an unprecedented rise in fuel prices.
This mainly resulted from speculation engaged in by companies which have made very high profits from the speculative valuation of oil stocks purchased at lower prices.
This scandalous rise in prices has worsened the living conditions of the general population, particularly the economically weaker sections of society, and has had a devastating impact on economic activity in various sectors, such as transport and other services, industry, agriculture and fisheries.
However, despite a significant fall in the price of crude oil, in some countries high prices are being maintained and the victims are the consumers.
This should prompt the creation of a tax, by each Member State, imposed solely on extraordinary and speculative profits in order to bring these into the State coffers, which can then help to support the sectors and people most affected by the situation.
However, the main changes should be structural, with a halt to the liberalisation of the energy sector, bearing in mind that this is a strategic sector for development.
As a result, this should be nationalised in order to guarantee public policies that serve national interests and the population as a whole.
<D>
(EL) Madam President, Commissioner, thank you for your kind words about the measures being taken by the Greek Government.
The government has indeed introduced harsh measures, and the European Commission has indeed ratified the government's programme and a very harsh programme has indeed been ratified in order to monitor the application of the measures, which the government instigated and which it wants.
And yet the spreads increased.
The problem is not that the markets were reserved, as you said.
The problem is that the markets speculated and speculated wantonly.
The very people who caused the crisis are now making money from the ruins they caused.
And what about the European Commission?
I ask you the following: firstly, will you take action now, not only for strict monitoring of the states, but also for strict monitoring of the markets and, if so, what?
Secondly: it is unacceptable that talk about the International Monetary Fund in the euro area has dragged on for so many months.
However, the International Monetary Fund does one thing: it imposes harsh measures and then lends cheaply, which leaves no room for speculators.
Do you intend to take steps to give financial support to the countries which apply such harsh public finance programmes?
<D>
(RO) We welcome, first of all, the action plan adopted at the recent G20 meeting, as well as the particular contributions made by Mr Barroso and President Sarkozy.
The final decisions made reflect the strategy discussed and adopted by the European Union's Member States.
We should also welcome the commitment of all the participants to work together to combat the current crisis in the financial sector.
At the moment, people are not interested in disputes, only in real solutions.
Interdependency generates two-way channels which allow the crisis to spread, but they can allow the solutions for economic recovery to spread too.
In Romania's case, unemployment in any country of the European Union accelerates the rate of unemployment in our emerging economy at double the speed.
This is happening firstly as a result of people working abroad being sent back home and then due to the reduction in the number of jobs being offered by foreign companies, which are scaling down their activities.
At present, unemployment needs to be analysed at pan-European Union level, but the solutions need to be implemented and financed at both ends of these channels.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, the Commission is well aware of the historic importance of the Polish shipyards, and that is why we have been working very hard to find a solution that will allow the restructuring of the sector in a way that provides a livelihood for the regions concerned.
However, we depend on the cooperation of the Polish authorities to arrive at a viable solution.
To be quite clear, the state aid investigation in these cases has been pending for around four years.
The investigation concerns a substantial amount of operating aid to the Szczecin, Gdynia and Gdańsk shipyards.
Without even counting the state guarantees from 2002 until now, the Gdynia shipyard received from the Polish state - which means from the Polish taxpayers - aid amounting to around EUR 167 000 per worker.
That is approximately EUR 24 000 per worker per year, and that means that the subsidy to each shipyard worker is at least double the average annual income of Polish workers.
Even without counting the state guarantees, the total aid received since 2002 by the Gdynia and Szczecin shipyards amount in nominal value to around EUR 700 million and EUR 1 billion respectively.
Despite all that money, the yards and the future of the workers remain vulnerable.
That, I would stress, is what really scares me.
I think that the future of the workers needs to be taken into account.
They have avoided the painful but necessary restructuring that, for example, the German and the Spanish shipyards have undertaken and which Malta is also preparing for at this moment.
At all times in those past four years the Commission has had an open door for the successive Polish governments.
I have met quite a number of ministers and prime ministers of Polish governments.
We have tried again and again to reach an agreement and, unfortunately - and I say it with a sad heart - the Polish authorities did not make use of those possibilities.
In July of this year the Commission came to the conclusion that the latest restructuring plans did not ensure the viability of the shipyards, but, again, conscious of the importance of the issue for the Polish economy and for Polish society, we, the Commission, showed flexibility and offered two more months for new final plans to be presented by 12 September.
During the summer, Commission officials remained constantly available and gave feedback to the Polish authorities on the draft submitted to them.
I have now carefully assessed the restructuring plans submitted by the Polish authorities on 12 September.
Unfortunately, I cannot see how to conclude that those revised final plans will ensure the viability of the yards.
Indeed, the plans require even more public money to be pumped in in future, including money for the day-to-day operating aid.
It should also be underlined that the restructuring plans submitted on 12 September - and I am talking about the plans of the Polish Government - foresee job reductions of approximately 40%.
However, these sacrifices would be made without giving any prospect of sustainable employment to the remaining workers, as the yards would very likely not become viable and would continue to need state support at the expense of the Polish taxpayers.
That is not an acceptable outcome.
It is not acceptable from the EU competition law perspective, but also not acceptable for the future of the shipyards.
Not acceptable to their workers and more generally for the Polish economy.
Therefore, as the situation currently stands, I do not see how to avoid the adoption of negative positions on the Gdynia and Szczecin shipyards.
But the Commission is not in the business of just saying 'no'.
We have been working actively to help the Polish authorities come up with a solution that would ensure a viable commercial future for the economic centres of Gdańsk, Gdynia and Szczecin and ensure sustainable jobs.
According to this scenario, the assets of the Gdynia and the Szczecin shipyards would be sold on market terms in several bundles.
The assets would be put into bundles following an open, unconditional and non-discriminatory tender; and the remaining shell company would use the proceeds from the sale of the assets to repay the aid received over the years and would be liquidated, and the buyers of the assets would then be able to speedily resume economic activities at the shipyard sites, without the burden of having to repay the large quantities of state aid received by the yards over the years.
They may re-employ even more people than would be the case if the restructuring plans of 12 December were implemented.
I can only assume that any investor willing to take on the yards - or at least some of their current liabilities - would be even happier to acquire the most important productive assets free of debts and develop them in a competitive and sustainable way.
The final outcome would probably be positive in two respects: on the one hand, the number of workers left without a job would be lower than foreseen in the restructuring plan submitted by the Polish authorities and, on the other hand, the workers re-employed by the purchasers of the yards' assets would have much more stable working prospects within viable undertakings, because the burden of past debts would have been lifted.
That solution, which would be in line with the recent precedent of Olympic Airways, would allow a fresh restart of economic activities at the shipyard sites, also benefiting the workers there.
The Commission has raised that possibility with the Polish authorities.
We have done that several times, and I sincerely hope that they will take advantage of our flexibility to bring us a concrete proposal.
Technical discussions on the possible implementation of the 'Olympic Airways' solution for the Gdynia and the Szczecin shipyards are being held between the Polish authorities and Commission officials.
As for Gdańsk, I think there is a good chance of reaching a positive outcome if there remains flexibility and good will on both sides.
You will naturally ask me: why this approach for Gdańsk?
There are two reasons: firstly, Gdańsk has already been sold to a private operator which injected fresh money into it and, secondly, this yard's liabilities for past aid are far more limited compared to the Gdynia and the Szczecin shipyards.
On the Commissions side, we have already indicated to the Polish authorities our position in assessing the compensatory measures needed to comply with EC state aid rules.
Because the yard has received less aid in the past, we can be less demanding in this respect.
The quid pro quo for the openness on the Commission's part is that the Polish authorities must now submit a draft restructuring plan for Gdańsk in order to permit any outstanding issues to be discussed, and so far - and I regret this - we have not received such a plan, and it is essential that the Polish authorities provide it quickly.
Moreover, the Polish Government can request support from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund - an application which is likely to be successful - and the size of the intervention would depend on the amount of co-funding the Polish Government is ready to invest, as the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund co-finances a maximum of 50% of the cost.
The European Globalisation Fund analysed by the Commission to date the amount per person to be supported, ranged between EUR 500 and EUR 10 000 from the fund, to which must be added an equal amount to be funded by the Member States.
To conclude, I can say that the Commission has been very forthcoming in assessing these cases and has shown a considerable amount of flexibility.
We have done everything we can, and we will continue to work with the Polish authorities to find an economically viable and socially sustainable solution which is in line with EC competition law and established Commission precedents.
Now the ball is in the court of the Polish authorities.
The future of the shipyards and of their workers depends on the Polish authorities' willingness to cooperate with the Commission to quickly find a positive solution in the framework I outlined earlier.
<D>
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, let me start with an apology.
I was not aware that the previous speaker was absent and that the speaking time had been changed.
Thank you for permitting me to speak now.
I was the rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection and after in-depth deliberations, the committee adopted this position by consensus.
I would like to point out, first of all, that there was agreement within our committee that soft law - or whatever we want to call these measures which are now being applied increasingly frequently in European law but also in national legislation - has become a very common practice which offers the opportunity to respond flexibly and therefore swiftly to new developments, which is why it should not be criticised per se.
We also agreed to some extent that the Commission - to turn to the European level - uses soft law in individual cases as a means of circumventing the opportunities for the participation of the legislator as provided for by law.
This, in our view, is a major problem relating to soft law.
We discussed, too, the fact that Parliament endorsed the complaint against the Commission in one case because we ascertained that such circumvention had indeed occurred.
We believe that the legislator encounters soft law in such diverse ways today that we must always make a clear distinction between what genuinely only comes on to the market in the form of a green paper, on the one hand - in other words, it is simply planned as preparation for further legislation - and on the other, what is genuinely necessary for flexible legislation in the framework of soft law.
As members of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection, we do not identify any legislative, any direct impact of such green and white papers, but we believe that when new legislation is adopted, the legislator must always adopt a new decision as well.
The debate, after all, not only focuses on soft law but also on other benchmarks for better law-making, and I believe that in many areas, we certainly have not made as much progress as citizens now assume from the media, which is why all the institutions involved - Parliament, the Council and the Commission - have a responsibility to make faster progress in this area.
<D>
Mr President, agrofuels are not the main driver of this crisis, but boosting inefficient first-generation agrofuel production at such a moment is not a good policy choice, so 10% mandatory agrofuel is a bad policy choice.
We should remind ourselves where it comes from.
This was the trade-off between pressure from the automobile industry to move the Commission to be less ambitious on car efficiency and to buy or to compensate this less ambitious policy with the higher target on agrofuels.
This is perpetuating a myth, which is that, in a world in which millions of Chinese and Indian young people also dream of having a car, we are suggesting that you can continue to build huge limousines and fuel them with agrofuels.
This is factually not possible on a planet which has limited resources, so I urge the Commission to reconsider this.
Be more ambitious on car efficiency.
We need to go from a unidimensional agrofuel policy to a holistic policy for energy from biomass, and concentrate biomass where it is most efficient, which is in electricity and heat production.
By the way, that is cheaper than using agrofuels which are inefficient.
<D>
in writing. - (CS) The Lisbon Treaty has become a dead document, just as when the French and the Dutch rejected the EU draft Constitution.
Although the President of the European Parliament, Mr Pöttering, declared that the aim of the Treaty was to achieve greater democracy, greater political effectiveness and greater clarity and transparency, and that the ratification process must continue in those Member States that have not yet ratified it, these are just meaningless phrases.
Had referenda taken place in countries other than Ireland, the Irish 'no' would surely not have been the only one.
Take the trickery employed by the 'European elite' who presented nothing more than the dusted and amended EU draft Constitution for ratification!
In addition to the Irish, the French and the Dutch would say 'no' again; after all, public opinion surveys carried out in these countries indicate as much.
Those who 'steer' EU policy should realise, at long last, that the majority of citizens reject the Union as a militarist and neo-liberal project that is effectively antisocial!
The result of the Irish referendum is not a disaster for Europe, as some people would have us believe.
It is a chance to start a new discussion process in which, at last, ordinary citizens should also be widely involved.
After all, the Irish did not vote against the European Union.
They voted against the contents of the Lisbon Treaty that would ruin the social standards achieved to date, and turn the Union into a militarist conglomerate.
The so-called European idea is not thrown into jeopardy by those who reject the Lisbon Treaty.
It is thrown into jeopardy by those who are now shouting 'let us go on' or considering introducing a 'two-speed' Europe.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - (DE) Mr President, I would like to respond immediately to the question from Mr Turmes.
My comment had nothing whatsoever to do with the car industry but was one of principle on the connection between industrial policy and environmental policy, between economy and ecology.
You will of course be aware of my viewpoint: we in Europe have to set the highest standards.
However, it makes no sense to run so far ahead of things that industry migrates away and we begin to export pollution and, as a result, import unemployment.
These remarks were not related in any way to the car industry.
There I fully share your view that we not only have the opportunity, but also the obligation, to establish Europe permanently as the lead market for environmentally-friendly cars.
As I now have the floor I would like to point something out to Mrs Corbey: it is not correct to assert that the Chinese are building cars that are more environmentally friendly than those made in Europe and that these are now flooding the European market in their millions.
The few hundred Chinese cars that are currently to be found in Europe are of extremely dubious quality, not exclusively but also from an environmental viewpoint.
The same can be said for the people's car, the Tata, that is now being manufactured in India.
If you relate the weight of these vehicles to their fuel consumption you will see that their performance is significantly worse than that of the cars currently being built in Europe.
The same applies to the US: it is now quite unrealistic to make the accusation that American cars are more environmentally friendly than European ones.
If you think about it for just a moment you will soon come to the conclusion that this cannot be true.
When it comes to modern technology, the only working hydrogen-powered cars in the world are to be found in Europe.
Nobody else is spending more on research in this area than we are.
I would like to close with a thought that will perhaps unite us all: I am able to remain quite composed throughout this entire debate for I really do believe that we are on the right road, because I know that the European car manufacturers and, more importantly, the European automotive suppliers - for they really are the driving force behind European industry - have not been asleep in recent years but have been working on a whole series of technological breakthroughs that will enable us to achieve our objectives.
Mr Turmes, you are perfectly correct and I would have been happy to support such a proposal: the industry would be delighted - and so would I as the Commissioner responsible for industry - if we could now say what the next stage in the process should be.
This is precisely what we have set out in CARS 21, namely a long-term, stable and predictable regulatory framework.
This can be as ambitious as possible provided that it is long term and provided it is stable.
<D>
Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Madam President, honourable Members, I would like first to thank Mr Doorn for his report on the application of the directive on statutory audits of accounts.
I would like also to thank the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, and more particularly Mrs van den Burg, who has contributed to the production of this report.
In the context of the financial crisis, it is essential that all Member States who are currently behind should quickly transpose the directive to achieve the objectives set.
The Commission continuously monitors the transposition status of the directive in the Member States.
A dashboard is regularly published on our website.
The results relating to the Member States' performance should clearly improve this spring.
Mr Doorn's report has certainly facilitated such an improvement.
As your report emphasises, the Commission has already adopted the recommendation on quality assurance and the recommendation on the limitation on the civil liability of statutory auditors.
I thank Parliament for its support for these two initiatives.
The recommendation on the limitation on the civil liability of statutory auditors is part of a strategy to reduce the concentration in the auditing market.
To explore other options along the same lines, a consultation on control structures in audit companies and on their consequences for the auditing market was published in November.
The European Parliament is asking the Commission to assess the national laws transposing the directive and to inform it of the effects of the measures taken by the Member States in the wake of the recommendation on the limitation on the civil liability of auditors.
At the appropriate time, we will be happy to prepare these assessments, taking into account all the issues raised in the report by Mr Doorn.
This is a commitment from Commissioner McCreevy that I am happy to pass on to you.
I thank Mr Doorn and I dare to hope that we will see practical results.
<D>
Increased social mobility has led to a higher number of mixed marriages and also of divorces.
Difficulties have often arisen concerning the choice of law to apply when each member of a couple hails from a different EU Member State or when one partner is a EU national and the other is not.
That is why harmonisation of the provisions on mixed marriages is urgently needed, so as to pre-empt discrimination during the divorce proceedings.
The choice of jurisdiction should be made on the basis of access by both members of the couple to comprehensive information on the most important aspects of national and Community law.
They should also be informed about the procedures relating to divorce and separation.
The opportunity to choose the appropriate jurisdiction and law should not infringe the rights and equal opportunities of each of the spouses.
Consequently, the choice of the law of a particular country must be a choice between the law of the state in which the marriage took place, or the law of the state in which the spouses have had their habitual residence for the last three years or the law of the country of origin.
In addition, it seems appropriate to apply the so-called principle of the law of the state in which the court is located when there is a danger of discriminating against one of the spouses.
One example could be the case of women from third countries where divorce is not recognised, but who are resident in the EU and apply for divorce or separation.
In such situations, the benefits to the individual of obtaining a divorce or separation, as an expression of their independence as a person, should outweigh arguments for implementation of national law.
<D>
President of the Commission. - Thank you very much, Mr President and all the distinguished Members of this Parliament, for this exercise.
I really enjoyed it.
I think it is a good exercise.
I have to tell you very frankly that it is extremely difficult for me to compress all my arguments, or at least my main arguments, into one minute, especially because most of the time I am not speaking my own language.
I am speaking in languages that I believe are more accessible and that requires an additional effort from me.
Anyway, you decide the format.
I can discuss it with you because I believe that free, confrontational and controversial debates are a good contribution to a stronger European democratic space.

on behalf of the S&D Group. - (LT) The Social Democrat Group cannot remain indifferent to the recent murders of human rights activists in Russia.
The deaths of Anna Politkovskaya, Natalya Estemirova, Zarema Sadulayeva, Andrei Kulagin must not remain meaningless.
We condemn utterly the perpetrators of these barbarous actions and the fact that sadly in some regions of Russia there is an atmosphere of impunity and political murders are not investigated.
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has promised that the perpetrators of the murders will be found and punished.
His reaction was stronger than the previous president's, but so far these are only words.
Time will tell if the Russian authorities are able to carry through the commitments made, so important to the country's citizens and the international community.
In our opinion, evaluation in the proposed resolution of Russian actions in the Northern Caucasus has exceeded the resolution's area of application, therefore the social democrats have decided to adopt their own separate document.
The social democrats are convinced that the human rights situation in Russia would really improve if EU-Russia human rights consultations were stepped up.
The European Parliament, the State Duma, civil, social and human rights organisations in the EU and Russia should make an active contribution to these consultations.
We stress that the protection of human rights must be discussed at length at the next meeting of the leaders of the EU and Russia.
This matter is becoming an inherent part of the new agreement between the EU and Russia.
<D>
(FR) Mr President, since 2005, we have been greatly moved by the catastrophic situation of the migrants held on the island of Lampedusa, whose numbers are well in excess of its real accommodation capacity.
The situation is difficult for this small island which, in 2008 alone, had to cope with the arrival of almost 31 700 immigrants.
These massive flows have been brought under control in recent years as these migrants have been sent to other centres on the Italian mainland.
These transfers were interrupted following a decision taken by the Minister for the Interior and we are seeing a serious deterioration in the situation.
However, the Presidium project, which is jointly managed by the Ministry of the Interior, the High Commissioner for Refugees and the Italian Red Cross and part-funded by the Union, has become an example of good management of migrant reception.
The decision to end the transfers to Italy is creating a real problem of access to asylum procedures.
As for Mayotte, since 2007, we have known that the nominal capacity of the Pamandzi centre has been exceeded.
It became known that 204 people, generally minors, were being housed there, while the maximum capacity is for 60 people.
The current conditions are catastrophic: the men are sleeping on the floor; there is no distribution of any bedding or toiletries and men, women and children have to use the same lavatories.
The detention conditions are degrading and an affront to human dignity.
The pressure of migration is indeed felt more strongly in these territories, but the dignity of each person must be ensured and each case should be investigated in accordance with the law.
It has already been stated that we have an unavoidable need for a real European policy on asylum and immigration and for solidarity at the Union level.
We have been making this request to the European Parliament for several years and we are therefore making a fresh appeal to the Council.
<D>
I would like to say a big thank you to the rapporteur, Mrs Jędrzejewska.
She has done an excellent job and, in the main, we are, in fact, in agreement in the Committee on Budgets, even though there are some areas - and I will come back to this - where we in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament have a slightly different view.
We are well aware of the crisis situation in the Member States' finances.
In spite of this, we essentially defend the EU's budget, even though we are now keeping to very low levels, particularly when it comes to new policy commitments for next year, where Parliament, too, is keeping its increase below a rate of 1%.
This is very modest.
As regards payments, the rate of increase is higher and that is also reasonable.
To now try to keep back structural fund payments would directly affect those countries with the greatest problems in terms of jobs and growth.
We need to remember that countries such as Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Latvia are all net receivers of the EU's budgetary resources.
Cutting the budget will not benefit them.
We must not forget that.
Firstly, then, we are being restrained.
Viewed over the last 20 years, the EU's budget has actually increased more slowly than those of the Member States.
That is something that we should not forget either.
Secondly, we Social Democrats do not accept the view that austerity measures are the only way to deal with the crisis.
We are therefore fighting for an increase, especially in category 1a, which includes investments, research and development and labour market initiatives.
There must be an increase here.
However, we are not in complete agreement with the Council and the Commission with regard to the ITER project.
We are in favour of this project, but it must not be the only priority when it comes to research and development.
It must not be allowed to supersede everything else.
Therefore, if we are to proceed with ITER, we will need to carry out reviews and more money will be needed.
Thirdly, and just as importantly, we need to maintain solidarity during this crisis.
If the hardest hit by cuts in the structural funds are those who really need support, then the policy is unacceptable.
Fourthly, we also believe that a certain increase is justified on account of the Treaty of Lisbon.
The EU will have a number of new tasks in relation to the External Action Service, new financial institutions, energy and the climate.
We cannot assign new tasks to the EU and then not pay for them.
Finally, I would like to mention the foreign policy budget, which is clearly underfunded.
If we are to be able to afford to provide aid to Palestine and find the necessary funds for enlargement, we need more money.
Therefore, it was also important to us Social Democrats to tie in the 2011 budget with a debate that has a more long-term perspective: about own resources, the budget ceilings for 2012 and 2013, and the financing of the new financial support mechanism.
In order to achieve this, I welcome the Commissioner's mention of flexibility as a possible solution.
I am absolutely certain that we will not succeed in these budget negotiations if we cannot in some way either review the budget ceilings or utilise the flexibility instrument.
I believe that this is absolutely necessary.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, Parliament's report shows that both our institutions' approaches to moving forward in the area of asset management are very much aligned.
We also need future decisions to be based on a thorough analysis of impacts.
We both want efficient markets that respond to the needs and expectations of the European fund industry and European investors.
Important efforts have been made in that direction.
More important efforts are ahead of us.
We are committed to delivering, but we should be cautious.
We need to preserve the reforms and the repute of the UCITS brand.
We need to take the time to involve and consult with all stakeholders, and we need to avoid unnecessary intervention that risks distorting the market but does not bring about noticeable benefits.
Only when all those conditions are met can we be confident that our decisions are up to the challenge.
We look forward to further cooperation between our institutions in this very important area.
<D>
Mr President, I wish to begin by expressing my condolences to the relatives of those who lost their lives and those who have suffered from the earthquake.
But I want in particular, if I may, to address my remarks to Mr Jouyet for his declaration today that President Sarkozy, who comes here tomorrow, will attend the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games.
I would like to recall the editorial in today's local newspaper, Les Dernières Nouvelles d'Alsace: 'L'Europe a capitulé' - Europe has capitulated.
Not only is President Sarkozy going to the Olympic Games, but also, on 16 June, broadcasts by a group that broadcast into China via Eutelsat, with the permission of the French authorities, were suspended.
This has been done before.
On this occasion I beg the French Government to allow NDTV to resume their broadcasts.
I am submitting today, to the United Nations rapporteurs on torture and religious freedom, a dossier relating to some of the people I had contact with when I was in Beijing two years ago.
Mr Cao Dong continues to be tortured in a prison in north-east China.
Mr Niu Jinping was re-arrested on 20 April 2008 and is being tortured.
His wife, Ms Zhang Lianying, has been tortured many times and has been imprisoned four times.
I am putting on my website a dossier of 50 sorts of torture that she is suffering.
Mr Gao Zhisheng, a Christian human rights lawyer, I know was very badly treated earlier this year.
He remains under house arrest.
Mr Hu Jia was arrested after giving evidence to the European Parliament's Subcommittee on Human Rights.
This is an arbitrary, brutal and paranoid regime.
We should keep politics out of sport; we should keep Mr Sarkozy away from Beijing.
(Applause)
<D>
(DE) Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Kirilov's report primarily concerns changes to the three Structural Funds Regulations 2007-2013 with the aim of improving cash flow and liquidity in the Member States.
This is one measure for combating the economic crisis which we can support unconditionally.
Member States are now required to make full use, for example, of the opportunities for supporting investment in energy efficiency and renewable energy in housing and the new investment opportunities in housing in general.
These planned measures will contribute to accelerating, simplifying and increasing the flexibility of the use of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Funds.
I must emphasise that these measures do not conflict with free competition, social standards and the implementation of environmental and climate protection regulations within the Community.
It is now the responsibility of the Member States to guarantee the co-financing of the money provided by the European Structural Funds in order to be able to make full use of it.
The demand in the report for increased simplicity in the administration and implementation of the funds is to be welcomed and supported.
Commissioners, we are looking forward to further proposals on this subject from the Commission in 2009.
It is important to emphasise the significance for a successful economic recovery of measures to support employment and business.
However, Member States should be urged to make extensive use of the Structural Funds for promoting or creating jobs in small and medium-sized businesses.
The committee has taken full account of our amendments.
We must support this report unreservedly.
Congratulations, Mr Kirilov.
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the PPE-DE Group is content with the outcome of this process.
This is primarily due to the fact that the rapporteur, by dint of consummate bargaining skill, great patience and dogged persistence, managed to negotiate and seal a compromise which the entire Committee on Legal Affairs was ultimately able to endorse.
May I therefore express my very special thanks to our rapporteur.
It was clearly evident from the outcome that patience had been the best policy.
Rather than take snap decisions at a single reading, it was right to opt for further negotiations with the Council and the Commission, because this was precisely the sort of matter that lent itself to treatment at one reading with a view to resolving all the complex issues rather than burning the midnight oil two years hence at meetings of the Conciliation Committee, which would have had to discuss the same problems we are examining today.
As I see it, Article 5 is the core of this regulation, and we are delighted that we have managed to alter the substance of Article 5 to reflect the original intention of the Rome Convention, namely to balance the interests of consumers with those of providers.
Had the Commission's proposal been approved, we know that it would have had quite serious repercussions on e-commerce and on small and medium-sized businesses, and this would have impacted adversely on the supply of goods and services to consumers.
We have constantly criticised the fact that the Commission, in spite of the Interinstitutional Agreement of December 2003, has failed to carry out an impact assessment in this case.
We confidently assume, however, that this is the last such omission and that the same mistake will not be repeated in future legislative proposals from the Commission.
Lastly, I merely wish to observe that the whole debate about consumer contracts, about the country-of-destination principle and the country-of-origin principle and about the relationship between providers or suppliers and consumers has only reinforced Parliament's repeated message that, in the long run, we need an optional instrument for the law of contract governing cross-border trade, and we are pleased that this requirement is set out in the recitals of the motion for a resolution before us.
<D>
(CS) This is an important day, a day of moral satisfaction for all the victims of totalitarian regimes.
My father, Štefan Kányai, spent nine and a half years in a Russian gulag.
In his book he describes the crushing reality accompanying the cruelty of Stalinism, which is something we must remember!
I thank you on his behalf.
I also thank you on behalf of Bishop Ján Vojtaššák, Monsignor Viktor Trstenský, Štefan Putanko, Štefan Janík and thousands of other brave sons of the Slovak nation who were victims of communism.
The Slovak priest František Dlugoš writes the following in one of his books: 'To investigate the events that took place during the 40 years of the communist regime, to find out people's destinies, means revealing the soul of the nation.'
Following today's debate, I can add 'the soul of Europe'.
I welcome this debate because examining this unique period in time, and the events that took place during this period, can be very beneficial for us now and in the future.
<D>
It is outrageous that a dangerous criminal should be able to hide behind a lack of information about his criminal record so as to evade justice or commit crimes in other Member States.
The Fourniret affair is a distressing and painful example of this.
In these conditions, allowing the preparation of complete and readily available criminal records, which include convictions handed down in different states, seems a welcome improvement.
However, this laudable initiative does not just target paedophiles, murderers and armed robbers.
Simply by including the words 'disqualifications arising from a criminal conviction', it also covers international persecution for holding certain views.
We know only too well who the target is, in this madness that is Europe, open to the winds of uncontrolled immigration, perpetually repenting for what it was, what it is and what it could be: patriots attached to their identity, proud of their people, their nation and their history, and who dare to proclaim out loud their intention to defend them.
Therefore, we are abstaining because we fear that, apart from the legitimate repression of crime, this text will allow the extension to the entire Union of laws that destroy freedom and do so much damage to the democratic life of our countries.
<D>
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have before us a very important and positive directive.
I would like to thank the Commissioner, Mr Dimas, who handled this.
I say so myself, as a member of a group that often criticises directives and the Commission: this is not the case here.
This directive will be a huge step forward for Europe, both from the point of view of the quality of its policies and its effectiveness.
With the completion of the framework directives on the natural elements, the soil will be considered as a key part of the biosphere, a fundamental element of the environmental and climatic balance and not just a platform on which to build.
The soil is living, it absorbs CO2, it produces biomass: it must be safeguarded, it must even be improved, because European soil is particularly polluted.
Europe understands this.
We had a long and difficult discussion in the Committee, and I would like to thank Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines for being so passionate about the subject.
However, there is the risk that Parliament will interfere with the Commission's text.
I never like to see this happen, I always prefer it when Parliament is more advanced than the Commission.
Someone has even recommended that the directive should be rejected, but this would be a serious mistake.
Europe must look to the future.
The soil beneath us is soil that we all share, it is part of our planet.
It is the only soil we have and we must look after it.
<D>
Mr President, what I would like to suggest is that we focus specifically on the al-Nashiri case.
There is the possibility of the death penalty being imposed during the military commission trial on Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri.
I wish to remind you, just as Mr Tannock has also done, that al-Nashiri has been accused of very serious crimes, including involvement in the attacks against a US aircraft carrier and the oil tanker MV Limburg.
Our opposition in principle to the death penalty must make us ask the US authorities not to impose the death penalty.
On the other hand, I would like to say that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) has regarded and does regard a strong transatlantic relationship as a priority, in that this is based on the conviction of the existence of a set of common values and on respect for human rights.
We are all united in this Chamber in utterly rejecting acts of terrorism and in expressing our support for the victims of these attacks.
However, I regret that a democracy like the United States and dictatorships which Mrs Vergiat is defending explicitly or implicitly are grouped together.
(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))
<D>
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to Mrs Martens, especially for the way in which we were able to work together in committee, for her attentiveness and also for the divergences that emerged, the differences between us; but I think the outcome, apart from a few points, is a very significant one.
EU-Africa relations have come a long way since the Cairo Declaration of 2000.
Much has changed in Africa, a continent that is full of diversity and wracked by war.
Progress has been made with the formation of the African Union, the policy of unity in diversity.
The Pan-African Parliament has adopted the motto 'one Africa, one voice'.
Social movements in Africa are vibrant and calling for what Mr Öger was referring to just now.
They are vibrant and forming themselves into networks, and they had a very high profile at the Nairobi Social Forum.
There has also been real progress in the formulation not of a European policy on Africa but a joint African and European policy of partnership.
The meetings between the Pan-African Parliament and the European Parliament, and their presence at the Lisbon Summit, are putting into practice what we said in the document was lacking, namely the role of this House.
We are not only demanding a role but also to perform it in practice, and I think the assistance from Louis Michel has been extremely important, obviously in addition to that of the Portuguese Presidency.
Nonetheless, our differences of opinion are clear.
The various aspects of the strategy are important, but we must carry them forward with coherent policies, and I am referring here to arms sales and trade.
We must therefore proceed along this road, in the knowledge that the road is strewn with obstacles.
<D>
Mr President, the recent poll in the Irish Times on Monday showed growing support for the Lisbon Treaty in Ireland, with 51% of voters now saying they would vote 'yes', particularly at this moment of Irish economic fragility.
This is an increase of eight points since the last poll was taken by the Irish Times in November of last year.
The 'no' vote has also dropped six points to 33%.
Concerning our current strained relationship with the European Union, in the absence of leadership from the present government, an attempt must be made to address the root causes of the Irish electorate's periodic disenchantment with the EU.
There must be a meaningful engagement with the Irish people to rebuild an understanding of, and support for, the European process.
This communication shortfall can be breached by allowing more positive information to flow freely about the advantages of being part of the EU.
I believe it is important that the positive role of Europe must be highlighted through our education systems.
This should not apply to Ireland alone, but also to all Member States.
I would urge that the communication deficit be tackled at the earliest possible date.
<D>
in writing. - First and foremost, Europe must devote its efforts to help its members in their quest for the search of oil and gas.
There is a probability that Malta has fossil-fuel reserves beneath its seabed.
Full exploitation cannot be carried out because of issues on the median line between Malta and its Northern African neighbours.
This should not only be a bilateral issue but it is also in Europe's interest to seek a solution on behalf of its Member State.
The issue of nuclear energy has once again taken a prominent position.
There are pros and cons.
The nuclear debate is never-ending.
One cannot fail to take note of the possibility of evaluating this energy supply.
I am informed that Malta was considering the importation of energy generated from nuclear plants in France.
This energy, on reaching Malta, would be in the form of electricity and the negative aspects associated with nuclear plants would not be an issue.
The energy generated would be cheaper than that from a gas pipeline from Sicily.
Malta would not have to undertake the capital expenditure needed to construct a power station.
<D>
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Mr President, this is not the first time that we have discussed this issue; it is also not the first time that we have had the same answers from the Council, which says that it has no competence here, as does the Commission, although - and I must congratulate the Commissioner for this - she did say at the end that things need to be organised differently in the European Union.
If something happens that affects the security of all Europeans, and that comes under the security strategy that Mr Solana described to us, we need to be able to talk to each other about it.
Parliament fortunately is able to talk about it.
This is an issue that concerns both the citizens and the Member States of the European Union, so we feel it is entirely proper that it should be on the agenda.
I do not intend to go back over all the objections that our Group has already voiced against this plan that the Americans have come up with.
What we think is wrong is that bilateral negotiations are going on with two NATO Member States which - coincidentally or otherwise - are also Member States of the European Union, and this affects relations with Russia, including the European Union's relations with it.
It is also wrong that the system is being developed unilaterally, albeit within NATO, and that it has not been clearly explained exactly why the system is necessary, whether it will work and whether it is becoming too costly.
There is an interesting debate going on in Poland at the moment, where the new government has said that it may be prepared to cooperate on the system, but that this is because it is what the Americans want and because it is America's security at stake rather than Poland's.
After all, the system is actually more of a threat than an improvement to Poland's security.
This is why the Poles are also asking for more help with developing air defences for the Polish army, for example, creating a sort of arms race.
So it is interesting that the debate has restarted in Poland on whether the system is useful or necessary, and that the new Polish prime minister or at least the Polish foreign minister has had the guts to talk to Russia about it.
We wholeheartedly support this.
The situation is rather different in the Czech Republic, where we have the impression that the system and the Czech contribution to it are being pushed through against the will of the people, since I believe that 70% of Czechs are against the development of the system.
I therefore fear that there are moves afoot to push through decisions this year, to conclude agreements with Poland and the Czech Republic, before a new administration - hopefully - takes over in the United States.
We know that the democrats are fairly sceptical about developing the Air Missile System.
In any event, we hope that there will be a discussion in the Council, and we urge that this issue be taken very seriously.
If it goes through, it is bound to have an impact on our already difficult relationship with Russia.
The public are anxious.
What we have is a new arms race, and there are a number of other things that we think the European Parliament simply has to speak out about.
We have done so in the past, and we should carry on doing it.
I think that our main role is to see whether this is necessary, whether it is the start of a new arms race, whether it really will improve security and whether it really will help us to combat the 'rogue states'.
I am still not convinced that the Iranians will have the capacity to fire missiles as quickly as the Americans claim.
This is something else we have had contradictory information about.
So I hope that we can take the discussion forward on this issue here in Parliament, and also monitor what is happening in the Czech Republic and Poland.
My Group remains opposed to the system.
<D>
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take a few moments to underline the fact that for the implementation of the budget of the European Agencies for the financial year 2006, we can support what the Court of Auditors says, since the accounts and transactions are legitimate and regular.
As I said in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, however, I recommend greater compliance with the principles and rules in subsequent years.
In the case of the Maritime Safety Agency, 43% of payment appropriations were cancelled and a concentration of transactions was recorded towards the end of the financial year.
I also expressed puzzlement about the low utilisation rate for payment appropriations for anti-polluting measures at sea, despite Parliament's continuing support for these measures.
For the Aviation Safety Agency, the high rate of appropriations carried over, at 40% of operational expenditure, was also noted, as was the use of carry-overs of non-differentiated appropriations, which is a breach of the budgetary principle of annuality.
The Commission is therefore called upon to review the Agency's fee structure to bring costs and revenue for certification activities into balance.
Finally, for the Railway Agency, the use of expired contracts and irregular extensions to regular existing contracts means that it cannot be stated that all transactions were legal.
I therefore recommend greater transparency and accuracy in future; however, in the light of the Court of Auditors' observations I propose that Parliament grant the discharge to the executive directors of the agencies.
<D>
Thank you Mr President and thank you first and foremost members of the European Parliament for the constructive and interesting discussion.
Allow me to respond to two of the points that have been raised.
The first concerns flexibility.
I have seen from the speeches made by some MEPs that there is a desire to ensure the necessary flexibility when negotiating Economic Partnership Agreements.
I would like to stress that the Council is very aware of flexibility at two important levels.
The first of these is flexibility in the sense of fully exploiting the options for asymmetric arrangements, timetables and protective measures within World Trade Organisation rules.
I therefore cannot agree either with the opinion or with the sweeping conclusion that 40 years of assistance to developing countries has been a catastrophe.
I believe that the situation would have been much worse without aid from the EU and other countries.
At the same time I think that the rules we have allow such a degree of flexibility that every one of these countries - and in this I have faith in the Commission and the Commissioner - should be capable of finding a solution which matches their needs and interests.
The second kind of flexibility is the one that we are offering in the transition from the interim provisions of EPAs to full regional agreements in the interests of supporting regional cooperation.
The second point I would like to respond to from the debate concerns the question of the development dimension of EPAs.
There is no doubt in my mind that the agreements are not conventional trade agreements as they have an intrinsically strong development dimension.
The agreements establish lengthy interim arrangements of up to 25 years and they also include exemptions - up to 20% of goods coming from ACP countries can be exempted from liberalisation.
The agreements make provision for monitoring and reviews that will involve Parliament.
Their implementation will be supported by the Aid for Trade financial package.
I consider all of this to be proof of the developmental nature of these agreements.
At the same time I would like to say on behalf of the Czech Presidency and the Council that we will be closely monitoring the progress of negotiations over EPAs and I would like to express my support for the Commission and also Commissioner Ashton for the efforts she has made to date to fulfil the mandate that the Council gave her.
During the course of the Czech Presidency we will be focusing on EPAs at the May meeting of the Council for General Affairs and External Relations within the format of ministers for development cooperation.
If agreement is reached between us and our partner-ministers from the ACP countries then this issue will also be on the discussion agenda for the joint meeting of the ACP and EU Council of Ministers in May.
During the Czech Presidency, the Council also welcomes the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in Prague at the beginning of April, just a few days from now.
I am certain that EPAs will form one of the main topics of discussion and that the discussions will prove highly important precisely because they are taking place in a parliamentary context.
I look forward with personal interest to your vote tomorrow.
In my view this is a key moment in the development of EPAs.
As we have heard, negotiations are still continuing in many regions, but in the Caribbean region important and good results have already been achieved.
As far as Côte d'Ivoire is concerned, we have reached a key point in respect of further progress.
Many countries await the approval of the European Parliament and with it the culmination of several years of difficult negotiations and I firmly believe that Parliament will give a positive signal to the world which is much needed at this point in time.
I believe and I am sure, even in the current crisis that has been referred to several times here, that this is an instrument that will really help, even during this great uncertainty that we all feel.
We all know that it will help the development of these countries.
<D>
(LV) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one of the targets put forward in Europe's energy strategy is to increase the proportion of total energy consumption accounted for by renewable energy resources to 20% by 2020.
Latvia is a leader in this sphere, since the proportion of renewable energy in Latvia is already 37%.
When allocating targets for the proportion of renewable energy to each Member State it is difficult to do so fairly, and to ensure that each Member State is actively involved in making use of renewable energy.
I can support the rapporteur's position, that we must take care that the larger Member States do not obtain reductions and targets for renewable energy proportions that are lower than 20%.
In view of the fact that the five largest Member States account for at least 60% of EU energy consumption, reductions for the large states would entail a disproportionately large burden on the other states.
It must be acknowledged that the EU has already had negative experiences on a similar issue.
The approach taken by the European Commission when allocating CO2 emissions quotas was, at the very least, strange.
According to the Commission's own information the aim of the emissions trading scheme is to help the Member States to meet their Kyoto commitments.
The new Member States are meeting their Kyoto commitments, but their emissions quotas are being significantly reduced.
For example, Latvia, which has the lowest CO2 emissions quota per inhabitant in the European Union, will receive only 55% of the emissions quota it requested.
Estonia and Lithuania will receive 52 and 53% respectively.
The quotas for other new Member States have also been significantly reduced.
In contrast, almost all the older Member States, which are not fulfilling their collective Kyoto commitments, have been allocated more than 90% of the emissions quota requested.
It is not surprising that five new Member States were forced to challenge this decision in the courts.
I welcome the position taken by the rapporteur on the allocation of additional EU budget resources for achieving the targets of the European energy strategy, establishing this field as a priority and revising the EU Financial Framework for 2007-2013.
The targets put forward in the European energy strategy are to be welcomed from both an economic and an ecological viewpoint.
It only remains to appeal to the European Commission not to repeat past mistakes and to allocate these targets fairly, ensuring that each Member State is actively involved in the achievement of the targets.
Thank you for your attention.
<D>
author. - Madam President, Burundi has been in a precarious state for a number of years.
The scenes of barbarism that took place in the 1990s between the Hutus and the Tutsis will always remain deeply embedded in our minds and will always seriously disturb our conscience.
Numerous attempts by the international community, as well as by regional players, have not yet resulted in the much desired long-lasting peace and stability in the area, although it has to be said that much progress has been achieved.
The recent military confrontations between the national defence forces and the National Liberation Front have resulted in the loss of innocent lives and are most disturbing.
Both sides must realise that they must resolve their differences at the negotiating table and not on the battlefields.
Both must realise that violence will only bring more violence.
The rebel group must denounce violence and lay down their arms, but at the same time the Government of Burundi must cease to provide impunity and to cover up for criminals within the security forces who carry out torture and illegal detention.
Let us hope that common sense will prevail at last and that the main sides involved in this brutal internal fighting in Burundi will manage to resolve their differences peacefully for the sake of the safety and well-being of the people of their country.
<D>
in writing. - (ET) The new rules presented in the new telecommunications package will help regulate the telecommunications market and promote consumer protection.
It will be significantly easier for consumers to obtain information from their service provider and change service providers.
Precontract information must indicate whether a consumer is tied to a contract for a specific period of time.
In addition, service providers cannot hold on to customers for longer than 24 months.
The moving of a telephone number from one service provider to another must be done within one working day.
The transparency of the provision of services has improved, and consumers are able to compare prices on web pages, and local operators can be obligated to provide services to handicapped people.
Consumers can ask for a maximum price level to be set, once their monthly consumption reaches a certain level.
If a service provider inadvertently divulges an individual's personal information on the Internet, they must properly notify the person of that fact.
The new rules will also help regulate the telecommunications market and ease the arrival of new services onto the market.
The coordination of the radio spectrum in the EU creates an opportunity for the provision of completely new services, and removes the obstructions that have existed until now, for instance on the viewing of television programmes on mobile phones.
The rights of state regulators have been increased, and a new EU regulator has been created, with the objective of strengthening independent market supervision, which will definitely benefit consumers.
Thank you.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - (EL) Mr President, we shall be debating a really difficult but important issue today.
let me first of all thank all those who have worked to make this debate possible today, and especially the rapporteur, Mrs Breyer.
The subject has always been difficult.
A balance needs to be struck.
Protection of health and the environment need to be increased, while procedures are simplified and administrative costs are reduced to allow for greater competitiveness and innovation.
I am convinced that the Commission's proposal will help achieve these two goals, for it supplements the internal market.
It does this by setting up a system of flexible mutual recognition of zones, and allowing Member States to take measures and to adopt restrictions, in cases of special health or environmental hazards, whether in throughout a Member State or in parts of it.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a fact that plant protection products play an important role in agriculture, crop growing, silviculture and market gardening.
I wish we did not need them, because they certainly affect human and animal health, and the environment.
We must therefore ensure that the relevant rules are effective and balanced.
The legislation in force dates from 1991.
On the basis of a 2001 report by the Commission on the legislation's function and where it can be improved, both the European Parliament and the Council asked the Commission to put forward proposals for the amendment to the directive.
I daresay nobody doubts the need for the existing legislation to be updated.
Allow me to thank the interested bodies in all sectors and mention the vital contribution they have made in the framework of this proposal's preliminary draft .
The Commission has also carried out a comprehensive impact assessment.
The first priority is indisputably to achieve the highest possible level of protection for human and animal health, as well as for the environment.
This will be achieved through a number of provisions: establishing clear, strict criteria for the approval of active substances; giving a central role to the European Food Safety Authority in the assessment of active substances; and obliging farmers to maintain files on the use of plant protection products, to be made available on request to their neighbours and the water industry.
The Member States' authorities will also have to intensify checks on the commercial exploitation and use of plant protection products, and the Commission will examine and verify how effectively Member States are carrying out these checks.
Further experiments on animals will be banned outright.
So as to promote sustainable agriculture, the safest alternative solutions will replace the most hazardous products.
The proposal will thus create a safer framework for the use of plant protection products in the EU and will reinforce measures to protect the environment.
The proposal does the same as the Lisbon Strategy because it will also reduce administrative costs.
The procedure will be shorter and more efficient, while, more importantly I believe, preserving levels of safety and protecting the health of the environment.
The Member States will no longer be working in isolation because mutually recognising approvals will now be the rule, rather the exception.
This will avoid dividing the internal market over plant protection products and stop splitting the market over agricultural products.
The changes to data protection rules will lead to greater transparency and fairer competition without hindering research and innovation.
The proposed regulation is one of the keys to the Commission's overall strategy in the pesticides sector.
It complements the proposal for a directive on the sustainable use of pesticides, which has already been analysed by my colleague, Mr Dimas.
Finally, let me to mention the large number of amendments which have been tabled.
This is hardly surprising for such a complex subject and perhaps we have not yet reached complete agreement in our views.
I am optimistic that we will shortly be able to do so the next stages of the procedure.
Meanwhile, the Commission can accept certain amendments while rejecting others.
The complete list, with the Commission's view on each amendment and the relevant explanation, is available to Parliament and MEPs.
It is not for me to analyse every amendment separately here because there is certainly not enough time.
I ask for this list to be included in the Minutes of the sitting.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I look forward to a constructive and interesting debate.
<D>
President of the Commission. - I have already answered a previous speaker with some ideas on the internal market but, regarding the point you are clearly making on technology, I fully agree.
We are behind the United States and others in terms of investment in new technologies.
That is why, for instance, in this special package, we have approved a European economic recovery plan.
We have put a lot of emphasis on investment in some issues regarding the climate agenda and energy security.
We are linking those two issues.
That is why we have very recently come up with the SET Plan and we are also urging Member States to devote more resources to financing green technologies, in other words, all the technology that can enable us to become a more sustainable, greener economy.
Certainly this is a matter that we should also consider for the next financial perspectives.
As you know, we will put forward our budget review before the end of the year.
There will also be an opportunity to have a good debate about where, in the future, we should place our emphasis in terms of investment.
<D>
in writing. - The European Union spends colossal sums of taxpayers' money every year in the name of multilingualism.
For an organization that seeks to erode the differences between nations and peoples, the EU attaches a great deal of importance to linguistic nationalism.
One such example of this is the concession to Irish nationalists of making Gaelic one of the official languages of the EU.
The costs and bureaucracy associated with the misguided policy of multilingualism will only increase as the EU expands further.
My constituents are rightly concerned about what they see as the indiscriminate use of public money to satisfy a policy that has little practical use beyond political window-dressing.
Despite the fact that English has become the common language in the European Parliament, I would hesitate to make it the single working language.
Given the EU's enthusiasm for harmonization, I believe that a common language is a natural step on the road to a federal superstate.
I therefore believe that we should have a handful of working languages.
If the UN can manage with six languages for 200 or so member states, I'm sure the EU can cut back too.
<D>
. - (NL) Mr President, we know that our words here will probably not get us much further forward.
We can only hope that all parties will permanently adhere to the agreement made at the Goma Conference and that the madness which has already gripped North Kivu for too long can come to an end.
According to the UN, since the start of the conflict 800 000 people have fled their homes.
Thousands and thousands of women and young girls have become the victims of vicious rapes, and children are forced to take part in the fighting.
Furthermore, we must not forget that the members of the Nkunda militia are not the only ones responsible for massive cruelties.
No, all parties, including the government soldiers, have systematically committed crimes against humanity.
There are not many 'good guys' in North Kivu.
Ultimately, therefore, the same number of culprits must be tried.
They must answer for their atrocities.
It is not only the responsibility of the International Court of Human Rights to pass judgment, it is primarily the responsibility of the Congolese leaders and of Joseph Kabila.
<D>
in writing. - I voted for this report because I believe this is a good time for the Commission's Green Paper, officially endorsing the economic and social importance of the sector, to prompt discussion on 'unlocking the potential of the cultural and creative industries'.
The growth of cultural and creative industries in the European Union since the 1990s has been exponential in terms of job creation and of their contribution to GDP.
r work.
At the same time, it is absolutely crucial that we ensure that a large number of online services are available to consumers.
The best way to do this is to create good conditions for legal, operationally sound alternatives.
There are currently already several good examples, and they should be made more visible.
Creating effective alternatives is the best way to combat piracy.
At the same time, it is vital for the Commission to come up with an ambitious proposal on copyright - something that we look forward to with anticipation.
One of the things we point out in the report is that a pan-European approach should be taken.
It is no good us operating with 27 different systems in this important area.
I therefore believe that the Commission should take a holistic approach and look at the connection between licensing, private copyright fees and piracy.
I hope that this report can help to get this started and I look forward to an ambitious proposal from the Commission.
<D>
on behalf of the PPE Group. - Madam President, I would also like to start by thanking the rapporteur for the very good cooperation we have had in this matter.
As the shadow rapporteur for the PPE Group, I would like to present the PPE position on the Framework Decision as it is and, of course, on the amendments.
The PPE position differs from that of the rapporteur on two matters.
The first is the degree of involvement of Eurojust in direct communication between the domestic authorities.
While the rapporteur asks for mandatory involvement of Eurojust in every case from the initial stage of communication, we believe that the referral to Eurojust should only take place when national authorities fail to reach consensus because, after all, as it is now, this initiative is about direct communication.
We, too, would like to strengthen Eurojust and its part in the judicial cooperation.
Our position on this matter only seeks to prevent bureaucracy.
If there is a possibility of the two parties reaching consensus, why introduce another body and procedure?
We do believe and agree that Eurojust must play a role when the parties fail to reach consensus, but where there is not a problem, we give the national authorities the flexibility to have direct bilateral contacts, which also boosts public trust.
The second matter relates to another proposed amendment which extends the competence of Eurojust beyond that provided in Article 4 of the Eurojust decision.
We believe that this matter, if it is to be discussed, should be approached in relation to the Eurojust decision via the main door.
This is why we will vote against these amendments.
However, there are no key points, so we will vote for the report as we want to encourage the exchange of information between national authorities.
We also support the oral amendment tabled today.
Finally I would like to stress that the PPE is keen to see judicial cooperation enhanced, and supports a European policy which should help citizens have the same guarantees and procedures in all Member States.
<D>
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, as a member of Parliament's delegation to the Palestinian Legislative Council, I have been trying to work out why, when we call for an end to settlement building, the Israelis ignore us and we do nothing.
Why, when we call for the removal of the checkpoints, the Israelis ignore us and we do nothing.
Why, when we call to an end to the collective punishment of people in Gaza, the Israelis ignore us and we do nothing.
So I am really grateful to Marc Otte, the EU Special Representative to the Middle East, who came to a meeting of the delegation yesterday and said that our policy - Europe's policy - is to follow the leadership given by America.
Now, just a few weeks ago, the Prime Minister of Israel said of President Bush, 'He is not doing a single thing that I do not agree to.
He does not support anything that I oppose.
He does not say a thing that he thinks will make life harder for Israel.'
So, American policy is Israeli policy, and we Europeans play follow the leader.
So, no wonder our condemnation of Israeli actions sounds so hollow to Palestinians.
And no wonder it is so lacking in success.
This European approach led to us sponsoring the elections in Palestine two years go, but then refusing to pay heed to the result - undermining our support for democracy across the Middle East.
This approach has led to us calling for the formation of a Palestinian Unity Government - and when a unity government was formed, we refused to talk to the Prime Minister and half the cabinet, and the government collapsed.
This approach has meant that we refuse to talk to representatives of Hamas in Gaza, even though they are the real power in that area.
What lessons from our history have we learnt?
Is it not time that Europe cut the strings that blind us and tie us to this one-sided policy of America and Israel?
Is it not time we spoke with independence and acted with vision?
<D>
Mr Schulz, I have been informed that this motion was tabled an hour earlier, from which I conclude that it was done as a preventive measure.
That is my hunch, anyway, Mr Schulz.
Why is it such a problem?
You have your conviction, others have theirs.
Let us all have our own convictions.
According to my information, an hour ago - on time, in other words - a proper request was made for a roll-call vote, should it come to a decision.
(Heckling)
You can each decide whether to bring your documents or not - it is up to the individual to choose.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, let me first extend my gratitude to the Fisheries Committee and especially to its rapporteur, Mrs Fraga, for her report.
This revised protocol has set the fishing possibilities and the financial contribution for the period 1 August 2010 to 31 July 2012.
It is the result of a long and complex negotiation process between the European Commission and Mauritania that was launched in October 2007, following serious under-utilisation of the protocol by European ship-owners, namely under-utilisation for cephalopods and the small pelagic species.
The main changes introduced in the new protocol are, firstly, related to the duration of the protocol, which we have extended from two to four years, and, secondly, a reduction of the fishing possibilities for cephalopods, following scientific advice, and for small pelagics, following the actual utilisation and the forecasts for the European Union fleet.
Thirdly, an overall reduction of the financial contribution over a four-year period, from an average of EUR 86 million per year to an average of EUR 72.25 million per year, but with an increase within this allocation of the part dedicated to supporting the country's fisheries policy: from EUR 11 million per year in 2008-9 to EUR 20 million per year in 2011-2012.
Fourthly, there is a revised procedure for dealing with infringements in Mauritanian waters.
This is a well-balanced protocol which conciliates the different interests: the need to adjust the EU financial contribution to reduced fishing possibilities for the EU fleet, and the importance of giving greater support to the fisheries sector in Mauritania so as to encourage the integration of this sector into the Mauritanian National Development strategy.
The Fisheries Partnership Agreement contributes 20% of the budgetary revenues of the Mauritanian state, compared to approximately 30-35% in the period 2004-2005.
The Fisheries Partnership Agreement amounts to 80% of the overall revenues from the fisheries sector within the state budget.
The European Community fishing effort in the Mauritanian EEZ represents 20% of the overall effort - that is both artisanal and industrial fleets.
During the negotiations, the Mauritanian side asked the Commission to make every effort to pay the first annual financial contribution by the end of August 2008.
This contribution is crucial for the Mauritanian national budget considering, as I said earlier, that annual payments under the Fisheries Partnership Agreement represent 15 to 20% of the country's budget.
It is also of vital importance for EU operators in the region whose activities may suffer in the event of non-payment before that date - that is due to non-ratification on the Community side.
I would also like to make reference to the question of relative stability, which was also raised by one of the Member States during the June Council, and to remind you that the Commission has no legal obligation to apply the previous allocation of fishing possibilities (i.e. relative stability) under the Fisheries Partnership Agreement, that is agreements which have a financial compensation, such as the one we are considering today.
This is because it needs to guarantee that the allocation reflects the best possible option for ensuring value for money (i.e. optimisation of the utilisation for the financial contribution).
Under these agreements, fishing possibilities should be allocated according to other criteria such as the utilisation rate of the previous protocol, the Member States' requests during negotiations and historical fishing possibilities allocated to the Member States and also the situation/capacity of the fleet.
<D>
Information is gold.
In order to provide citizens with objective information and to fulfil the task of educating, we have public service broadcasters in the area of television and media.
In return for broadcasting high quality programmes, these broadcasters have a right to funding from fees.
Broadcasting represents the main source of information for citizens.
Some public service broadcasters have rather successfully changed their programmes as a result of competition from private broadcasters.
The best example of this is the British broadcaster, the BBC.
Others, like the Austrian ORF, are not only suffering as a result of falling viewing figures; they also cannot genuinely fulfil the requirement for impartiality and objectivity due to their party political influences.
In addition, private broadcasters have started a debate as to whether broadcasting fees are, in fact, legitimate at all, as public service broadcasters also, of course, profit from advertising income.
As the organisation and the framework conditions are different from one Member State to the next, no standardising decision can be taken at EU level.
I have therefore abstained from the vote.
<D>
Mr President, surely in modern politics one of the most difficult things for a politician to say - other than 'I was wrong' - is 'let us stop and think again'.
We could do with that in this debate.
I am the first to acknowledge the hard work, in this House and in other places, that has gone into this proposal and into this report, and it is a matter of great regret to me that the end result really does not justify it.
It is a great regret for me personally because I was initially very enthusiastic about this proposal.
I myself sold it to our universities in Scotland, to our SMEs, to various other parties, and I have watched the proposal become increasingly weaker, diluted, muddled, precarious and, increasingly, underfunded.
Surely, we all agree in this Chamber that Europe does not commercialise our research enough.
We have agreed on the need to do something, but 'we must do something; this is something, therefore we must do this' is surely a bad logic, which will result in a bad, artificial, weak EU creation that will not achieve our hopes.
So let us be brave and rip this up and start again, and innovate and research a better EIT for Europe's future.
<D>
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are all aware that there is still much to be done in order to make European development policies more effective.
The recommendations contained in Mr Van Hecke's excellent report, which I fully endorse, certainly go in the right direction.
As we are debating this report, Brussels is witnessing the presentation of the new annual report of CONCORD, the European confederation of development NGOs, on the aid commitments given by EU governments.
The report examines the progress made by each Member State, and the picture which emerges is one of gaps and contradictions in our policies to combat poverty and increase aid effectiveness.
For example, as Commissioner Michel was telling me, the report notes that in 2007 the amount of aid given by the 27 did not increase as it should have done, but actually fell.
At the same time the report shows that many of the problems associated with development policies still persist, such as the lack of transparency of linked aid.
We should respect commitments given at international level.
We cannot dash the expectations of people in the southern countries of the world, nor those of people in the so-called northern countries who are working with such commitment to ensure that injustice, poverty and the food crisis, to which Mr Schapira just referred, are handled decisively.
I agree with the Commissioner: we need to stop the rhetoric and take action.
I would also like to thank Mr Michel for his passion, his commitment and his fortitude.
With the two conferences in Accra and Doha, 2008 can and should be a real turning point and offers an outstanding opportunity for the European Union to show that it can shoulder its responsibilities as leading world donor.
It seems almost superfluous to say that we need to increase the quantity and quality of aid.
These are not two conflicting concepts.
We must not use the need to make aid more effective as an excuse for giving less of it.
At the same time, everyone is now aware that simply increasing the quantity of aid is not enough.
It is vital, as we have all been saying, to have an objective for the fight against poverty, instead of geopolitical and strategic objectives.
As we are always saying, commercial, migration and security policies must be consistent with development goals.
European cooperation needs to be based not only on our own interests, but also on the genuine priorities of southern countries as identified by local governments, and also by parliaments and civil society, and it is also essential to increase the transparency and accountability of EU aid programmes.
In this context, Parliament should be put in a position to exercise genuine democratic control and I welcome the Commissioner's call to work hard to ensure that EU countries stand by their commitments.
I have a few questions regarding calls for proposals.
Those NGOs which want to participate in the Commission tendering procedures find that they are too long and cumbersome, which makes their activities really difficult and in fact excludes many small local associations.
So why not ask these organisations directly how to streamline procedures?
I have submitted an amendment to be voted today with this in mind.
Then there is the matter of the untying of aid which is dealt with in the Van Hecke report.
Progress has been made, but all aid needs to be untied completely in order to prevent money returning to donor countries instead of relieving poverty in beneficiary countries.
Lastly, I would like to pinpoint those States which are still overstating their public development aid figures.
In 2007, EU countries spent around EUR 8 billion, in other words about 17% of total European aid, in important sectors but not in the development sector.
Cancellation of debt, expenditure on refugees, grants for foreign students constitute expenditure which should be excluded from development aid figures; and so I invite you to support the relevant amendments.
I too have high hopes for 2008 and for the commitments to reverse the trend; I agree wholeheartedly with the Commissioner when he talks of shared responsibility between donors and countries where everyone has to play a part: rights and obligations.
That is our strength!
<D>
The operational problem with the Schengen Information System II was discussed recently as part of the Council meeting in February 2009.
It was highlighted once again that an immediate solution needs to be found to the impasse which SIS II is currently at.
However, I get the impression that instead of answers, there are even more questions raised after the discussions about SIS II.
The Council supports the implementation of an analysis and repairs plan to help identify the problems with SIS II's technical architecture, with the aim of making it stable and reliable.
On the other hand, the Council does not exclude the possibility of deciding to adopt an alternative technical solution which can achieve the objectives proposed by SIS II.
Whichever of the options is applied, it must not have repercussions on the schedule for the inclusion of the countries which are still excluded from the Schengen area.
I would like to know what measures the Commission will adopt to avoid any possible delay and how the additional costs incurred by these changes will be covered.
The example of Romania speaks for itself.
Romania's external border is 2 000 km long.
Its integration into the Schengen area scheduled for March 2011 is a major priority.
All this indecision may have consequences in terms of meeting this deadline.
I would like to mention one other thing.
At a time when the Commission is preparing to draft a new legislative proposal on the next stages in border management, I would ask the Commission to evaluate first of all the effectiveness of the current systems used to manage borders in order to achieve the best synergy between these systems, and then assess the opportunity for investments in border logistics.
In order to achieve the EU's strategic objectives, the Commission should not start developing new tools from scratch until the existing ones, such as SIS II or VIS, are fully operational and reliable.
<D>
President of the Commission. - As I said earlier, I cannot comment on specific cases or criminal accusations.
Regarding Mr Assange, an accusation has been made by the Swedish judicial system and is now being considered by the British judicial system.
Both Sweden and the United Kingdom respect the rule of law.
We have to let the normal process of law go on.
I cannot comment - and I should not comment - precisely because I very much respect the presumption of innocence and everybody's individual rights.
I cannot, therefore, comment on that.
Regarding the other comments you made about some of the things in WikiLeaks, I do not think it is right for me to comment.
The comments are attributed to United States diplomats and are therefore their responsibility.
I cannot comment on them.
I can only tell you our position, which is not the same as the United States' position.
Our position - the European position - is clear on the matter that you have asked us about.
We do not have to comment on specific leaks, whether they come from WikiLeaks or elsewhere.
<D>
(FI) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would also first like to thank the rapporteur, Mr zu Baringdorf, for the thorough work he has done in preparing for this debate.
Food safety in the EU has been shaken by many crises in recent years, such as BSE and several dioxin scandals, the latest of which apparently occurred last autumn.
The causes of the crises have often been found to be contaminated feed, due to negligence or even criminal activity.
This regulation to simplify and clarify legislation is welcome.
The regulation must bolster consumer confidence throughout the European food chain.
Consumers need to be protected and they must be able to tell where and how the food they buy has been produced.
Another objective is the legal protection of farmers.
They have to make choices on the basis of labelling, and they must be able to have faith in the impeccable quality of feed.
The manufacturing rights of the producers of feed must also be safeguarded, as Mr Mulder said earlier on.
In many Member States, things are well under control, but the regulation before us, which will make labelling clearer and make it easier to trace the origin of feed, is needed to ensure things are put right throughout the EU, and to end differences of opinion when it comes to interpretation.
I would nevertheless like to point out that it is crucially important with this regulation, and others, that there is proper implementation and monitoring.
Clear and precise regulations will not help unless they are complied with in practice.
When monitoring the quality of feed, it needs to be ascertained that it is safe and fit for purpose and that it meets the legal requirements.
This way we can improve the safety of the entire food chain and protect consumers.
<D>
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the Gomes report because it provides a very detailed analysis of the causes and consequences of Chinese domination in Africa from both an economic and a political perspective.
China's impressive economic rise in the past 20 years has led to an increase in the demand for oil and other raw materials.
China today imports 30% of its oil from Africa; that figure will reach 45% by 2010.
China also invests massively in infrastructures in Africa.
These commitments are without preconditions concerning human rights or social and environmental conditions.
Europe must sit up and take note of this situation and it must try to define a strategic partnership with both Africa and China to ensure the sustainable development of the African continent.
<D>
The high prices of roaming services in the European Community are a problem which both hinders the process of European integration and restricts the freedom of movement of the European Union's citizens.
During today's vote I endorsed the draft legislative resolution of the European Parliament amending Regulation (EC) No 717/2007 and Directive 2002/21/EC, which from 1 July 2009 to 2011 will gradually reduce the maximum cost of using roaming within the EU.
The maximum price for outgoing and incoming connections will be reduced each year by 4 cents, and in 2011 will amount to EUR 0.35 and EUR 0.11 per minute respectively.
In addition, from 1 July 2009 operators will have to charge on a per second basis, and sending a text message will not cost more than EUR 0.11.
The cost of data transmission will also be reduced, to EUR 0.50 per megabyte in 2011.
I definitely endorse the report.
It is another step towards a social Europe, where first place is given to people, their freedom, their liberty and the betterment of their standard of living.
<D>
Thank you, Mr President of the Commission.
We achieved much more than last time, one month ago.
Thank you very much, too, for keeping perfectly to your time.
We understand that it is not always easy to answer sometimes complicated questions in one minute.
I think it is very helpful for all of us in the two institutions to understand each other.
This is very responsible, and it is a very important signal for our citizens that the two institutions can discuss matters and communicate with each other.
We will see you again for Question Hour next month.
(Applause)
<D>
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - Mr President, could I say that the Commissioner showed a good understanding of the construction industry.
All I would say is that I think it represents a larger percentage of overall GDP, something like 12% or 13%, and of materials, say, 4 or 5%, so it is a very important sector.
I am a civil engineer by background and it was a privilege to do the opinion on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy.
I was delighted that at the end there was total, unanimous support for the opinion that we put down.
We looked at the technical matters more than the marketing because, overall, it is really an internal market approach that we are discussing tonight.
The construction industry does need a regulation after 20 years of having the Directive in place.
I would emphasise the need for more CE marking, which is absolutely essential.
We do not want to see any more national standards and I wish this whole process every success for the future.
It is a very important measure in a very important industry.
<D>
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) The Council refers the honourable Member to the Organised Crime Threat Assessment (OCTA), which is annually produced by Europol for the Council's attention and a version of which is published and submitted annually to the European Parliament.
On 13 June this year, in its conclusions on the OCTA 2007, the Council restated its conviction that the fight against organised crime should focus on reducing the threat and the harm caused by it and, in particular, on tackling the following problems: the obstacles to dismantling organised crime groups stemming from their international dimension or influence, the level of infiltration of organised crime into society and the economy, especially the misuse of legitimate business structures and the transport sector in particular, and, finally, the misuse of technology by organised crime groups.
The Council also stressed that the European Union's priorities for 2007 should be the following criminal markets: drug trafficking, especially in synthetic drugs; smuggling and trafficking in human beings, especially in relation to illegal immigration; fraud, especially in the area of highly taxed goods and Value Added Tax carousels; euro counterfeiting, commodity counterfeiting and intellectual property theft, and money laundering.
As was the case with the OCTA 2006, these conclusions highlighted the need for a multidisciplinary intelligence-led approach in order not only to disrupt criminal activities but also to dismantle criminal organisations, bring the offenders to justice and deprive them of the proceeds of crime.
This implies drawing on dedicated (specialised) resources and organising structures with a view to using all information that is available to law enforcement and thus identifying and tackling the most threatening criminal groups.
The Council also calls in its conclusions for the further development of a new, intelligence-led control strategy covering the entire national - and possibly EU - territory, complementing external border controls with checks, en route or at destination, monitoring financial movements and expanding the analytical capabilities of national and EU law enforcement agencies.
<D>
(PL) Madam President, I welcomed the fact that, for the first time, initiatives concerning simplification of legislation have been included in the Commission's work and legislative programme for the current year.
A better regulatory environment and clear and effective legislation are essential conditions for ensuring better implementation of the law.
This will in turn impact on the rate of economic growth and job creation, thus making a valuable contribution to the success of the Lisbon Strategy.
It should also be borne in mind that in many cases, the way in which Community legislation has been established to date has resulted in the emergence of a notion of a remote bureaucratic structure amongst citizens of the Member States.
This structure has been perceived as being uninterested in resolving the problems experienced by ordinary people or in making their lives easier, a situation which the Eurosceptics are busy exploiting.
Clearly, simplification cannot be confined to the European level.
It must also take place at national level, so that the benefits of Community simplification are not squandered due to national regulations.
I strongly support the calls to the European Commission urging it to monitor this process at national level too.
On its own, however, simplifying legislation does not guarantee that it will be of a better quality.
We need to determine whether so-called soft law does represent an effective instrument in the context of the Community.
We are all aware that the current model of soft law imposes the requirement to undertake transposition into the national systems.
Not only is this linked to higher costs, but it also has a significant impact on the clarity and effectiveness of legislation precisely at national level.
In addition, this leads to serious problems in the area of case-law, as it increases waiting time because of the need to address prejudicial questions to the European Court of Justice.
I agree with the statement that so-called soft law all too often amounts to an ambiguous and ineffective instrument that can have a negative impact on Community legislation and the institutional balance.
It should not be used as a substitute for desirable but unadopted legislation.
An effective system of assessment of the impact of legal acts is a sine qua non for ensuring high quality and effective Community or national legislation.
I believe much still remains to be done in this area, and I would like to take the opportunity provided by this debate to emphasise how important it is for the institution charged with carrying out impact assessments to be entirely independent.
Better law-making must also mean the involvement of the European Parliament both in interinstitutional debate and as a co-legislator.
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Mr President, President-in-office of the Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, it is primarily my own satisfaction and that of my group that I would like to express.
Satisfaction at the result obtained last Thursday in Lisbon, and satisfaction at the road Angela Merkel set out on and Mr Sócrates continues to travel.
By equipping itself with the institutional tools it needs to function, Europe is finally acquiring the means to meet the major challenges of the 21st century.
That was our wish.
For this reason, we have supported this text since the start of its preparation, though as you know, most of us would have preferred a still more ambitious text.
This Treaty is arousing criticism here and there.
Personally I welcome the agreement reached in Lisbon, as it signals the start of a new European dynamic.
Simplified Treaty, Reform or Reforming Treaty, Modified or Modifying Treaty, the name matters little.
What matters is not the box itself but what is in the box.
This Treaty will be officially signed in Lisbon on 13 December.
That is an excellent date.
The number 13 has always brought me luck.
Look at my date of birth; I was born on the 13th, so it is excellent.
It will then have to be ratified by all the Member States before the 2009 European elections.
Some have already made it known that the process will begin the day after the signature in Lisbon, and I am delighted about this.
To the heads of state or government of the European Union I would just like to say that it is important for this Treaty to be the basis of a European project founded on the true membership of its citizens.
The EU institutions and Member States must try to achieve this by explaining, then by explaining and finally by explaining some more.
What does this mean?
It means giving substance to the provisions of the Treaty that affect the democratic life of the Union.
The citizens' initiative and the involvement of the national parliaments mean that information will have to be provided about the content of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which enshrines the essential rights of European citizens.
However, it also means providing better information to our citizens about who the elected representatives in this Parliament are - there will be 751 of them in 2009 - and what they do.
It means explaining how qualified majority voting, which will become the rule, will enable Europe to act in new areas such as judicial and police cooperation, environmental protection, economic policy and immigration.
It also means explaining to our partners on the international stage that a High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, who will also be Vice-President of the European Commission from 1 January 2009, will be the primary contact, along with the President of the Council, who will be elected for two and a half years and will facilitate cohesion and consensus within the European Union so it can finally speak with one voice.
If the Treaty of Lisbon promises that the European Union will be more democratic, more transparent, more effective and more capable of acting as a single political entity on the international stage, it is to its citizens that this needs to be explained first of all.
Thanks to this Treaty, Europe will finally be able to move from discussion to action.
It will be able to begin far-reaching and necessary reforms to effectively combat crime and terrorist threats.
It will also be able to affirm its role as a world leader in the fight against climate change.
Ladies and gentlemen, when dealing with our international partners on such important challenges, we cannot allow ourselves to get caught up in unproductive divisions any longer.
The journey that began in Berlin, that has stopped over in Lisbon and will pass through Ljubljana and Paris, is heading in the right direction because it is finally laying foundations for consistent European policies; policies that should aim primarily for the protection, well-being and prosperity of citizens who are demanding even more of Europe, as our Polish friends who turned out en masse to vote have shown us.
For them and for all the others, let us live up to expectations.
<D>
I voted in favour of the report on complementarities and coordination of cohesion policy with rural development measures as I believe that these policies provide important pillars for national development, given the particular agricultural potential that Romania has.
I feel that it is important for rural development policy to aim at reducing the economic differences between urban and rural areas by identifying the typical potential of each area and encouraging the development of activities specific to them.
Rural development policies must be aimed at strategies which should not result in slowing down or stopping farming activities carried out by the rural population.
If anything, they should help diversify these activities by providing locally produced organic products and producing traditional foods and drinks.
The European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development has been created as a separate fund from the Structural Funds with the intention of using European funding more effectively in rural areas.
The advantage we have as a beneficiary state is that we share a wider range of finances for rural development.
Consequently, we will be able to achieve our goal of modernising social structures while, at the same time, boosting territorial cohesion between rural and urban areas.
<D>
in writing. - (DE) The Sri Lankan army is acting with the most brutal severity in its war against the Liberation Tamil Tigers of Ealam (LTTE) with absolutely no regard for civilians.
Civilians are constantly being killed or wounded in attacks by this army.
Hundreds of thousands are confined and many have no access to humanitarian aid.
The International Committee of the Red Cross has described it as one of the most catastrophic situations they have ever experienced.
An immediate cessation of all fighting on both sides, that of the Sri Lankan army and that of the LTTE, is needed.
All international organisations and governments should demand this.
In the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the British Conservative Mr Tannock, representing the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, gained acceptance for his demand for a 'temporary ceasefire'.
This would have supported the brutal war policy of the Sri Lankan government and given clearance for attacks on civilians.
I voted in favour of the resolution, because, thankfully, the majority of the European Parliament, including the PPE-DE Group, did not ultimately follow the inhumane policy of Mr Tannock and the British Conservatives and voted in favour of the demand for an immediate ceasefire.
By placing the LTTE on the EU list of terrorist organisations, the EU positioned itself on one side and gave the LTTE de facto clearance for carrying on the shootings.
As a result, the negotiations under way at the time under Norwegian mediation were blown out of the water and could only be continued with great difficulty outside the EU.
<D>
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FI) Madam President, firstly I would like to say on behalf of my group that it is true that the present system is fairly complicated.
It needs to be simplified, and we know that matters of education basically fall within the competence of the Member States, though in the case of the European Schools it also lies with the Union.
Wherever there are EU agencies there must also be European Schools.
That is a basic principle, and we should also remember that our various strategies allow us to tell the citizens of Europe that education is always an investment in the future.
It is on that basis that we should act in the case of the European Schools.
I would next like to raise a few points concerning education.
The first concerns the extent to which it is free.
I think that we in Europe should have a debate on making all education free, whatever school we are talking about.
Every child and young person should have the chance of a good education and the opportunity to benefit from good teaching, and not having to pay is one guarantee of that.
I think that if the Member States want this and if we really believe that education is an investment in the future, we can achieve this goal.
It is also important that teaching is done in the student's mother tongue, as that is the basis of identity.
Children and young people at European schools come from different cultures and different nations.
It is important that they are taught in their own language, but is also vital to remember that we need special teaching facilities and also that students need to be taught cultural awareness, as they are often rootless, coming as they do from one country to another, which is a new and alien environment.
For that reason we should also make sure of their overall personal development and growth as human beings.
This is also the basis for European human rights policy and the European notion of humanity.
As for the special facilities I mentioned, class sizes are one thing that could be invested in.
Class sizes must not be too large and every child should be given the chance to receive tailor-made options.
I will end by saying that the real educational standards amongst us Europeans will be measured in terms of how we treat those close to us who are worse off and how we look after children and young people, and the European schools are a shop window for the world.
What are our actual standards of education and how do we look after our young people?
Are we prepared to invest in them and their future?
I hope that Europe can afford to do that and that it does actually invest in children and young people and in the European schools.
<D>
in writing. - (RO) The signing of the new Treaty in the European Council of 13-14 December achieves a reform of the European institutions but, mainly, it increases the European citizens' power to state their opinion on the European legislation.
After the new Treaty is ratified, the Parliaments of the Member States will include the legislative proposals of the Commission into their own agenda, thus increasing the degree of democracy in the Union.
We would have wished a chapter of this treaty to be the very European Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
Unfortunately, it is only an appendix of the Treaty, but the legal basis for making its provisions mandatory is thus created.
The six chapters of the Charter guarantee the right to dignity, freedom, solidarity, equality, justice and citizenship.
The adoption of its provisions will make impossible any future discrimination of European citizens on criteria of nationality, ethnicity, religion, age, gender, etc.
The Treaty also offers the Union the possibility to promote the fight against climate changes at an international level and guarantees adequate social protection to all its citizens.
The Union is not based only on economic criteria.
We have to build a Social Europe, based upon solidarity, economic, social and territorial cohesion.
The adoption of the new Treaty requires unanimity in the Council and its ratification by all signatory States by June 2009.
<D>
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, the report refers to the future of cohesion policy.
It was difficult to find pragmatic answers valid for all 27 Member States and their different governance and partnership systems.
The rapporteur has managed to come up with very concrete proposals.
On governance, I would like to underline two elements.
We need to empower regional and local authorities with a better and more efficient sharing of responsibilities.
It is also of the utmost importance to address the lack of expertise and administrative capacity to deal with funds and projects at regional and local level.
On partnership, the report rightly insists on the centrality of inclusive processes and full ownership.
We need to bring in the largest number of stakeholders possible at all policy and implementation stages, and in order to do this we need minimum compulsory standards.
I am extremely satisfied with the way in which the rapporteur has dealt with all our contributions and concerns and congratulate him once again for his excellent work.
<D>
Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, we need to remedy a situation that is unfair.
It is not possible to have two categories of European citizens, one requiring a visa, the other being exempt.
I think that is a deeply held belief that we all share.
Secondly, I personally believe in the power of unitary negotiations.
Europe is much stronger when it speaks with a single voice, with all its members showing solidarity.
As Mr Mate knows, I ventured to point out that, on another subject that, relatively speaking, is in fact not at all similar, the Open Skies question, it was because the Commission had the mandate at a particular time that we were able to achieve the first stage of the Open Skies.
Well, in the same way I believe in the power of unitary negotiations and I must say that, with Mr Mate, we shall really work hard and with great determination.
I should add that the Commission has, all the same, established reciprocal arrangements with a number of non-member countries in the past.
Our arrangements have allowed us to achieve good results with Canada, Australia and other countries, so there is no reason why we should not be able to stop this discrimination.
I should explain that the Commission will already have representatives in Washington on Tuesday and Wednesday to start the negotiations formally.
In other words, that proves our determination to implement this mandate to the full.
That is what I am able to tell you on this first point.
I should now like to answer the questions raised by Mr Deprez in particular about the implementing agreements.
As Mr Mate has just said, we do not yet have the implementing agreements, so it is very difficult to assess them.
However, it will certainly be our responsibility then to assess them carefully in the light of the Community provisions.
I would add that we are going to be transparent, with Parliament in particular, on our negotiations with the United States, but the Member States - I am not accusing anyone, any Member State - but all the Member States that hold bilateral talks also have to fulfil that duty of transparency.
We need mutual trust if we are to be effective.
I must stress that.
Obviously if the implementing agreements later bring to light things that are not acceptable from the point of view of Community law, we shall see what needs to be done, but we shall do something.
Thirdly, some of you have raised the question of data.
I want to point out even so that the PNR exchange of data is governed by the 2007 agreement between the European Union and the United States.
Those provisions are there, they bind us at the moment and there is no reason to have to suffer any intimidation from our American friends.
That being so, I noted in passing the comments by Mr Deprez on the idea that ultimately, in a general transatlantic agreement, it would no doubt be useful perhaps for an independent authority to be set up to monitor the protection of the data.
Those are a few explanations, but I can really tell you that Parliament will of course be kept very much abreast of our negotiations, that our strength will come from a complete interinstitutional agreement that will show our American friends that the European Union fully intends now to demand fair treatment for all its citizens and will do so with unfailing determination.
(Applause)
<D>
in writing. - Today's vote on the election of Mr Tőkés as Vice-President of the EP has been a disgrace.
First, the President's explanations on how to vote have been both confusing and contradictory.
As a result, nobody knew for sure how to proceed.
Second, the voting machines of a number of Romanian MEPs - expected to vote against - were curiously not working properly.
Third, the vote was cast anyway and the President had left the entire matter hanging, leaving the room.
Fourth, the sensible request from the floor that the vote be repeated under normal circumstances has been rejected.
Fifth, so was the announcement that there were more votes than Members present!
Sixth, instead, we were simply informed that the vote had been validated anyway!
Seventh, even so, nobody could explain how 168 votes could represent a 'qualified majority' in a Parliament numbering 751 members!
In fact, the EPP has thus forcefully imposed its will on the entire Parliament!
I regret this, because they can certainly do better than this, and we, the other MEPs, equally deserve better!
<D>
in writing. - (LT) One of the fundamental freedoms of citizens in the Community is freedom of movement.
I believe that all EU citizens have the same right to participate in the political life of the European Union (EU), to freely express their political opinions and attitudes.
These freedoms became even more important after EU expansion to the countries of Eastern Europe, as once the Eastern European countries had joined the EU, economic migration from the new Member States to Western Europe intensified greatly.
Lithuania for its part leads in terms of the number of people who have emigrated since entry to the Community.
When I met Lithuanian emigrants in London I learnt that many of these people plan to remain in the United Kingdom long-term, especially those who have started families there and are enrolling their children in schools.
To my knowledge, such a tendency is also reflected in statistics.
The situation is also similar in the other EU countries Lithuanians have emigrated to.
I believe that it is particularly important to guarantee the right of these citizens to participate in European Parliament elections in the country where they are currently resident.
I would also like to stress that the participation of citizens in EU matters and elections to the European Parliament is not increasing, but quite the opposite, the EU is becoming increasingly distant from its people.
Bearing this in mind, I think that once EU citizens are given the right to vote in European Parliament elections in their country of residence, this will only strengthen people's trust in EU institutions.
For these reasons I voted for the 45th amendment.
<D>
Ombudsman. - Madam President, thank you for this opportunity to address Parliament on the annual report of the European Ombudsman for 2007.
I also wish to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Zdravkova, and the Committee on Petitions for their excellent and constructive report.
My report records progress in handling complaints, promoting good administration and providing knowledge about the Ombudsman's role.
The number of admissible complaints increased, in both absolute and relative terms, from 449 (12% of the total) in 2006 to 518 (16% of the total) in 2007.
We therefore met both of the objectives which Parliament has consistently emphasised: increasing the number of admissible complaints and reducing the number of inadmissible complaints.
The main types of maladministration alleged in admissible complaints were: lack of transparency, including refusal of information; unfairness or abuse of power; unsatisfactory procedures; avoidable delay; discrimination; negligence; legal error; and failure to ensure fulfilment of obligations.
Three hundred and forty-eight decisions closing inquiries were made.
That represents a 40% increase compared to 2006.
In 95 cases, the inquiry revealed no maladministration.
Such a finding is not always negative for the complainant, who at least has the benefit of a full explanation from the institution concerned.
Even when maladministration is not found, I may identify opportunities to improve the quality of administration provided by institutions.
If so, I point them out in a further remark.
Many of my inquiries result in a positive sum outcome that satisfies both the complainant and the institution complained against.
One hundred and twenty-nine cases were settled by the institution concerned to the satisfaction of the complainant.
That is double the number of cases settled in this way in 2006, and reflects a growing willingness on the part of institutions and bodies to regard complaints made to the Ombudsman as an opportunity to recognise and put right mistakes that have occurred.
When I find maladministration, I try to achieve a friendly solution.
In some cases, this can be achieved by the institution or body concerned by offering compensation to the complainant.
Any such offer is made ex gratia, or in other words without admission of legal liability and without creating a legal precedent.
When a friendly solution is not possible I close the case with a critical remark.
A critical remark is also appropriate if it is no longer possible for the instance of maladministration to be eliminated.
It confirms that the complaint is justified and indicates to the institution or body concerned what it is has done wrong.
Such a criticism is intended to be constructive, so as to help avoid similar maladministration in the future.
It is important for institutions and bodies to follow up critical remarks and to take prompt action to resolve outstanding problems.
To better monitor the impact of my criticism, I launched a study of the follow-up to all critical remarks, and to the cases involving a further remark, made in 2006.
The results of that study, published on my website and sent to all the bodies concerned, should provide encouragement to the European public service to improve practices and further develop a culture of service to citizens.
In cases where it is still possible to eliminate the instance of maladministration, I normally make a draft recommendation to the institution or body.
If it fails to respond satisfactorily, I may send a special report to Parliament.
I submitted one such report to you criticising the Commission for not dealing with an infringement complaint concerning the European Working Time Directive.
I welcome Parliament's support, as expressed in your resolution of 3 September 2008, based on Mr De Rossa's report.
This year, I have again included star cases in my annual report.
These are cases where I consider that institutions or bodies involved responded to my inquiries in an exemplary fashion.
Seven such star cases are highlighted.
Four of these concerned the Commission, one concerned the Council, one the European Central Bank and one the European Aviation Safety Agency.
I have continued to make every effort to ensure that EU institutions and bodies adopt a citizen-centred approach in all their activities, by seeking every opportunity to achieve friendly solutions and by launching more own-initiative inquiries in order to identify problems and encourage best practice.
I would now like to mention some other activities undertaken with a view to ensuring the best possible service to citizens.
I have continued my efforts to improve the quality of information concerning rights under EU law, provided especially through the European Network of Ombudsmen.
That network, which includes the Petitions Committee, cooperates in case handling and in sharing experiences and best practice.
One of the purposes of the network is to facilitate the rapid transfer of complaints which are admissible for me to a competent ombudsman or similar body.
When possible, I transfer cases directly or give suitable advice to the complainant.
During 2007 I was able to help 867 complainants in this manner.
A further important initiative which should come to fruition within the next quarter of the year is that my office is developing an interactive guide to help citizens find the most appropriate avenue of redress for their grievances.
This guide should enable an even greater proportion of complainants to address directly the body best equipped to deal with the complaint.
Complaints which are inadmissible for me will therefore be resolved more promptly and effectively.
My institution will then be better able to fulfil its core role - to help citizens who are unhappy with the way they are being treated by EU institutions and bodies.
The Ombudsman cannot work alone.
Ensuring a top-class administration is a task that must be fulfilled proactively in cooperation with EU institutions and bodies.
The increased settlement of cases and friendly solutions is a source of encouragement and serves as an indication of our mutual efforts to contribute to building citizens' trust, vis-à-vis the Union, at a point in time where that is greatly needed.
I am also deeply grateful for Parliament's support and guidance, both in terms of the budgetary resources you provide my institution with and in terms of the positive relationship I enjoy with the Petitions Committee.
With your continued support, I will endeavour to build on the achievements of this past year.
Finally, as this is the last occasion during this parliamentary term that I have the honour of presenting my annual report to this House, I would like to put on record my deep appreciation for the close cooperation and good advice that I have received from Parliament and individual Members during the past four and a half years.
(Applause)
<D>
(HU) I would like to thank my colleague, Mrs Ayala Sender, for an excellent report.
She has prepared some comprehensive material covering all areas, which will help in the drafting of the Commission Action Plan.
It is an investment in the future of the European economy for timely, effective freight transport logistics to be put in place throughout the whole of the EU.
Its existence will contribute to sustainable economic development, improved competitiveness and regional development.
However, to achieve this goal we need ever higher quality, more punctual, effective and secure logistics and, most importantly, harmonisation of transport methods so that the efficiency and the benefits of individual methods can be used to full advantage.
This requires the creation of the right technical, practical and economic conditions.
Impact assessments relying on a unified strategy for logistics development are required.
It is important to separate the roles of the state and the private sector.
Efficient logistics is the key to sustainable mobility.
Mature logistics solutions contribute to the optimisation of freight transport, and so it is also useful to look at opportunities for research and development support for developments in logistics.
<D>
(BG) Mme Chairperson, Mr. Commissioner, The sustainable transport policy, taking into account the energy and environmental aspects, includes transport infrastructure, employment through transport, mobility of people and free movement of goods.
The pan-European transport networks call for equal quality and environmental security.
This implies accurate stock-taking, especially of the railways, assessment of the current condition, and targeting of measures to countries that have not reached high European standards yet.
Reliable financial instruments need to be involved.
It is particularly important to put an end to the practice of turning some new Member Statses into old vehicle depots for Europe.
This is definitely environmentally undsound.
I am always concerned when EU reports mention the names of some geographic regions and omit others.
The Black Sea Region, too, is of great importance.
Sustainable intermodal schemes are needed there, as well.
Besides, it is within the framework of this report that we could possibly discuss the charges and the traffic on the Danube Bridge between Russe and Giurgiu, between Bulgaria and Romania.
<D>
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (NL) Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen.
Minister, you said in your introduction that relations with Russia are good, or anyway better than is reported in the international press.
Minister, are you living on Mars?
Are you living on Venus?
Do you dare to tell the Russians what matters, or is the European Union for you ultimately just about money and naked commerce?
Is that more important to you than democracy and human rights?
Let us not mince words: Russia is sliding down the slippery slope to becoming a full-blown dictatorship with a strong leader: a strong leader who will not tolerate any protest and who deploys his secret FSB police whenever he thinks it necessary; a leader who will not give up power under any condition and who will use all kind of trickery to keep his hands on the reins of power after the parliamentary elections in December and the presidential elections in March.
Russia, Minister, is evolving into a closed society where the ruling regime would prefer not to allow anyone to look over its shoulders.
I do not want to confine myself to theoretical considerations.
The reality is that human rights in Russia are constantly under pressure and the state of democracy there is lamentable.
The reality is that freedom of speech and press freedom are succumbing to a strict self-censorship.
The recently passed law on extremism can easily be used to gag independent journalists and political opponents.
The reality is that the Russian regime sees a strong and independent civil society as undesirable and that the position of NGOs is coming under severe pressure due to very restrictive legislation.
The reality is, Minister, that free elections are utopia there.
Only those who are tolerated by the regime can take part.
The 'Other Russia' coalition united around Gary Kasparov, for instance, has been stopped from taking part in the imminent parliamentary elections.
To conclude, Minister, the situation in Chechnya may not be a topical issue in politics any more but the reality there is still extremely worrying.
People are still being murdered, people are being picked up and detained illegally, people are being blackmailed; kidnappings are still a daily occurrence and torture is standard practice.
That is the reality in Russia, Minister, and I hope that you will remember this when you speak to Mr Putin at the end of this week.
<D>
(FR) Madam President, what should be our strategy to overcome this crisis?
Right now, the facts are before us.
The crisis is affecting all manufacturers and there is a knock-on effect hitting the 12 million European citizens who work in the automotive industry.
We must think, first and foremost, of these workers and their families and we must make it our priority to protect them by answering this troubling question: what is the strategy needed to overcome this crisis?
A fast and effective united and structured industrial policy for the medium and long term, a 'new car deal', a coordinated response by Member States and the Union that will be equal to the situation.
I hear, in this Parliament, the old dogmatic views of outdated liberalism resurfacing: no help, no subsidies, competition, nothing but competition.
Ladies and gentlemen, the time has come for regulation, for public action.
We therefore need a new car deal, an ambitious and intelligent plan for the automotive industry, first of all to save jobs and develop employment in Europe, with support for training.
Then, to speed up the technological change of these enterprises to clean and intelligent vehicles, with the resolve to revive demand, by simplifying the renewal of old cars on the road, which are generators of pollution, through the creation of a European environmental bonus.
In short, Europe must act and must not fail to respond.
It must act and not be silent and take no action.
We must act and act intelligently to support this transformation.
<D>
It is important for the people in countries on the African continent to have access to health care services.
It is good, therefore, that we are having a debate on health insurance systems and on how health care can be organised in low-income countries.
Unfortunately, the tone and approach of the report could have been a great deal better.
For example, it is regrettable that ideas still prevail in Europe that make it possible for phrases such as 'whereas people living in certain social and humanitarian circumstances do not always appreciate the concept of providence' to still be written.
We also believe that, in certain respects, the report has an outdated attitude to private health insurance and independent providers of health care.
In certain parts of Africa today, it is vital for these independent providers to be able to continue to operate in order for there to be any health care available at all.
In spite of these shortcomings, we believe that the aim of the report is a good one and that it presents a good number of sound initiatives.
We would also like to support the progressive forces working within the aid organisations for women's right to reproductive health.
We therefore chose to vote in favour of the report.
<D>
(FI) Mr President, a challenging year lies ahead: there are the elections and economic crisis on top of everything.
This means we have a very great responsibility, but, fortunately, Mr Surján and Mr Maňka are dealing with it.
I know that both men take their responsibility seriously and are very capable of discharging their duties.
This obviously means that we will have to consider Parliament's own projects in particular and that we should set an example to the general public and acquire its confidence as a result.
We really need to get the magnifying glass out and take a close look at what projects we can implement in this period.
They should be nothing very grand.
I wanted to focus on one detail in my speech.
It is that this year's budget acquired a new heading, the 'Baltic Sea Strategy', and I hope that this year both the Commission and Parliament will together hit on the right projects and find the right money for the right sort of measures.
The people who live in the Baltic Sea region are expecting a little meat around the bones of this Baltic Sea Strategy, and if we think things through, we might well succeed in this.
<D>
Where is our money disappearing to in Afghanistan?
I am pleased with the motion for a resolution on a new strategy for Afghanistan.
The report highlights very well the many problems affecting that country.
There is no military solution for Afghanistan, something the report also states.
If the troops have not been able to bring peace to Afghanistan, neither has the money that we have poured in.
The report even says that between 2002 and 2009, more than USD 40 billion in international aid was channelled into the country.
Of this 40 billion, just six billion went to the Afghan Government, the remaining 34 billion being channelled into the country from elsewhere.
As much as 70 to 80% of this aid never got to its intended recipients, the Afghan people.
Furthermore, the costs of the war in Afghanistan over the period 20012009 amounted to more than USD 300 billion.
However, these enormous sums of money are not doing the Afghan people any good.
Instead, it is, for example, the arms industry, mercenaries and international companies that get to benefit from the money spent in Afghanistan.
It is important that the report actually highlights this unsatisfactory state of affairs.
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (HU) Thank you, Madam President.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the situation of Roma people in Italy - as in the whole of Europe - is terrible, and has been so for many decades.
We have done extremely little, and the governments we guide or support, even governments belonging to our own political groups, are doing very little to put a stop to it.
Neither left-wing nor right-wing governments have managed to bring about any change over recent decades as regards acceptance of the Roma, and this is why I believe it is extremely important to give this issue a regular place on the agenda and in debate in this House.
We would like to ask for an even deeper commitment on the part of the political groups, however, and I believe that programmes are needed, genuine, properly implemented integration of the Roma is needed in Europe, if Roma people are not to fall victim to atrocities as a result of this sort of mass hysteria.
I do not think it is enough to make speeches in plenary sessions, and it is completely useless to treat this issue as a party political matter, because neither socialist, nor liberal, nor conservative governments have been able to do anything.
The ongoing lack of action in Europe at the moment with regard to the Roma issue is something we oppose, just as we oppose any reference to - or practice of - the principle of collective guilt, and just as we oppose crime.
I believe it is very important that the Italian government should do everything it can to fulfil its promise and ensure that the planned security package is not directed at any individual ethnic group, and that mass deportations are avoided.
Even more important in my view, however, is the message that we can send to countries from here, from Europe, and the responsibility that the European Commission needs to assume in order to ensure that minimum requirements are put in place, that an agreement is reached among the Member States regarding how they plan to go about changing the situation of Roma people in Europe in the immediate term.
I think it is indispensable for Europe's standing in both moral and competitive terms to stop the empty talk and place the emphasis instead on action, on putting serious plans into effect.
This should be the key focus.
I also think that it is our task to promote and to demand this.
Thank you.
<D>
(SK) The directive on the application of patients' rights in cross-border healthcare endeavours to solve an acute problem.
This problem is the conflict between the subsidiarity of healthcare systems and the right of European Union citizens to free movement, and also their fundamental human right of access to health services.
Free movement is the right of any citizen living in a Member State and his health moves with him.
Should he not be able to approach health services, he would face a serious obstacle hindering his free movement.
Complete equality of services is impossible because of different taxes paid in individual countries in respect of health services, as well as differing rates of treatment in individual countries.
Although many politicians worry about the onset of health tourism, especially from the East, their fears are unsubstantiated.
A very important thing for a patient is to be close to his relatives and not to face a language barrier.
The patient-doctor relationship is very specific.
The success of treatment partially depends on a patient's trust in his doctor or in the health establishment.
A patient's readiness to travel abroad to get treatment depends on the seriousness of the illness.
In cases of life-saving treatment or treatment of a serious illness, no other obstacles matter.
I think it would be preferable for these issues to be dealt with by the European Parliament rather than by the European Court of Justice.
It is sad that, although we are the citizens' representatives, we find making decisions more difficult than the European Court of Justice which, in each case so far, has found that the patient was right.
I should like to mention one thing in conclusion.
Many of my fellow Members talk about the rich and the poor.
For me, as a doctor, there is only the patient.
I do not care whether he owns a Ford or is homeless.
<D>
Madam President, children and politics - rarely are the interests of the citizens and of the politicians so far apart.
For citizens throughout Europe, the subject of children is right at the top of their priorities.
For politicians, children's issues are also-ran issues, as we can see again here, too.
I do not know of a single country with a dedicated ministry for children, nor is there a dedicated representative for the interests of our youngest citizens in the Commission.
In Parliament, the subject of children is spread across all the committees.
That is why I would like to give special mention to the Commission today, as it is dealing here with childcare facilities and the Barcelona objective.
Thank you ever so much.
In the parliamentary working group on Quality of childhood, we observed that our children live in a very complicated world.
The future for those who are children right here, right now - today - is completely uncertain.
A child of today can climb right to the top of the social ladder or fall right down to the bottom.
Such children can remain in their own cultural circle or they can search out another one.
They can follow a similar life path to their parents or do the exact opposite.
They can marry someone from the opposite sex or someone of their own sex.
More than 50 years ago, when we launched the project of uniting Europe, all that was completely different.
The diversity that characterises us as Europeans has become a decisive factor in the lives of children.
The concept of diversity must, therefore, find its way into what teachers and others engaged in educating our children teach.
Far too little attention is paid to this at present.
Europe's childcare facilities and schools are, after all, cracking under the strain of the challenge of integration.
We need to press the reset button when it comes to matters of integration and start again from scratch.
Let us approach this subject completely free of prejudice again, according to the slogan 'stop it through diversity'.
In addition, I would ask all the MEPs after me not only to come out and advocate gender mainstreaming, but to fight for child mainstreaming, too - especially in this time of global financial crisis - because, otherwise, we will saddle our children with immeasurable debts.

on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, neither the Russian presidential election campaign nor the election itself complied with the rules of democracy.
During the announcement of candidacies there was not even an attempt to keep up appearances.
The media were under constant pressure not to publish information critical of the candidate backed by the president-in-office.
The opposition's access to the media was blocked, and observation of the conduct of the election was impeded.
That is difficult to accept, especially in view of Russia's membership of the Council of Europe and the Russian authorities' earlier declarations on respect for human rights.
I must admit that such declarations are credible only to people who do not know Russia.
The infringement of democratic principles during the election was followed by protests, brutal repression of a demonstration and the arrest of demonstrators.
Russia has decidedly departed from democratic standards.
We call for the rapid release of all prisoners of conscience.
<D>
(FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my thanks go to the rapporteurs Mr Itälä and Mr Virrankoski for their excellent work.
I am glad that the Committee on Budgets approved the two pilot projects connected with the protection of the Baltic Sea.
I hope that the plenary session will also give its support to them.
It is time we paid closer attention to the Baltic.
Since the 2004 round of enlargement it has been an internal sea of the EU, but at the same time it is one of the world's sickest and most polluted seas, something that shames the EU.
One of these pilot projects has to do with reducing the amount of hazardous waste that ends up in the Baltic Sea and correcting the oxygen deficit in the deep basins of the sea.
The other is connected with cutting the sulphur dioxide emissions from shipping though emissions trading.
If this experiment gives good results, sulphur dioxide emissions trading may become a viable way to cut sulphur dioxide emissions in all sea areas of the EU, which would clean up the air we all breathe in the future all over Europe.
So I also hope that the plenary session will support these initiatives.
<D>
in writing. - This report aims to protect those who are unjustly marginalised and ensure that they have proper and adequate means to address their situation.
I was pleased to support it.
It has broad support from social platforms and civil society.
I am satisfied that it does not interfere with Member States competences in the following domains:
education
access to religious institutions
matters of marital or family status
the relationship between church and state
the secular nature of the state and its institutions
the status of religious organisations and
the wearing of religious symbols at school.
Ireland had, until recently, a very active National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism (NCCRI) and a well funded Equality Authority.
Despite the importance of the work that these bodies were charged with, including, among other issues, equality proofing legislation, these bodies have ceased to be, given the drastic cuts in funding available to them.
It is important that we continue to support these groups and their work.
Ms Buitenweg's report clearly demarks certain areas to remain part of the competency of each Member State, but progress on a European scale is important to achieve a social and more just Europe.
<D>
in writing. - (NL) This proposal is an attempt to take earlier decisions seriously through better controls, better information, secured parking places on motorways and the abolition from 23 March 2009 of exemptions for self-employed workers.
The transposition and implementation of social legislation on road transport in national law is hopelessly behind.
The four Member States that fall short in that respect are protected as long as they are not named openly.
The fact that they do not regulate working and driving times and rest periods is bad for road safety and for the welfare of professional drivers.
My party, the SP, is supporting the plan to do something about this, although better proposals have already been rejected in earlier votes.
We are doing that because we believe that it is important to comply with social legislation and because self-employed drivers are also to be covered by the Directive.
That will put a stop to the abuse of employers forcing their workers to become self-employed and not on the staff.
Being falsely classified as self-employed, they have worse working conditions and have to take on impossible business risks.
The competition in that sector is fierce.
The talk about complying with the rules has to be turned into action.
Only then can drivers still earn enough and make a secure living.
<D>
(ES) Prime Minister, it is right and proper that we should recognise that, following a worrying period of uncertainty, you have been one of the leaders who has reinvigorated the European transatlantic relationship and I must congratulate you on this.
However, for those of us who regard ourselves as deeply pro-European, it is sad to see that this transatlantic relationship is still laden with two items of ballast that previously made it sink: too much mercantilism and too much intergovernmentalism.
We also note that, although the ship is sailing well, the direction taken - or the course set, to put it in maritime terms - is the one shown by the compass of Mrs Merkel and Mr Sarkozy which is making the boat list clearly towards the Conservative right.
The question is: what room for manoeuvre do you have, Prime Minister, in order to right the ship and correct the course?
How do you think you can convince those who, despite being pro-European, are afraid of boarding the European ship because they do not see it as safe, or because they do not know where it is going, or because they cannot see either a social Europe or an environmentally sustainable Europe or an internationally responsible Europe or a transparent, democratic and popular Europe of which we have spoken so often?
Do you think you can lead the jump from market Europe to political Europe?
How?
Also, as you have congratulated this House so much, do you not think it is time for this Parliament to be the main European legislator?
Incidentally, while we are on the subject, and in light of the new information on the use of Spanish bases for the transport of prisoners to Guantanamo, does the government intend, though the UN Security Council, to review its relations with the US?
I am saying this, Prime Minister, because all this relates to Europe, in particular European credibility.
<D>
on behalf of the PSE group. - (HU) Mr President, Mr Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament considers protection of the European Union's financial interests to be one of its most important tasks since, like all parliaments, it has the right and the duty to monitor expenditure.
Moreover, the view that EU funds are inadequately looked after is increasingly widespread in Europe, so we also have a political debt to the public, to our constituents and to our taxpayers in this regard.
We put this legislative and political obligation into practice primarily by means of the discharge procedure, but in addition to this we have been producing regular reports on the protection of EU financial interests and the fight against fraud.
Our aim in doing so is not to create a sensation or cause a scandal, but to expose the situation objectively and resolve any problems.
I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate my fellow Member, Mr Musotto, for this excellent report, and to express my gratitude to the Commission Vice-President, Mr Kallas, and OLAF Director-General, Mr Brüner, for the constructive cooperation they have demonstrated in this area too.
Despite the fact that these high-level reports are greeted with much appreciation year on year, we in the European institutions sometimes feel as if we are tilting at windmills, since the findings of the reports encounter resistance on the part of the Council, with the result that the Commission has not been able to put the necessary measures in place for years.
We believe that the weakest link is the attitude of Member States, since in some Member States - our fellow Member Mrs Grässle spoke just now about Germany in this connection - there is a failure to recognise how very important it is to ensure that EU funds are spent in accordance with the rules, that expenditures are subject to scrutiny, and that any amounts unduly paid are recovered.
We consider it particularly lamentable that VAT fraud in the form of 'carousel' transactions is becoming increasingly widespread throughout Europe, to the extent that we have no global figures on the amount involved, although some estimates suggest that it may be around 35-40% of the EU budget.
It is time to take resolute action in this regard too, both in the interests of managing European affairs and in the interests of public opinion.
Thank you very much.
<D>
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, the report by Zita Gurmai and the recommendations contained in it are one more step to improving road safety within the European Union.
Most of us use vehicles on these roads.
They are equipped with technologies that are constantly improving: catalytic converters, ABS, ASC, lights, seat belts and so on.
However, as always, there is a 'but'.
Generally speaking, this electronic equipment is fitted to expensive cars that undergo safety tests, have crumple zones, and are fitted with many air bags or special belts.
These vehicles can withstand almost any accident but, unfortunately, most of the vehicles on our roads are medium or low priced.
What is even more important is that sales of these cars is constantly increasing and, according to the automobile magazines, we shall soon be inundated by a wave of cheap cars from India, China and other countries.
Obviously price is linked to quality and equipment.
Cars costing between EUR 2 000 and EUR 5 000 have little other than an engine, steering wheel, wheels, seats and, possibly in some countries, a single seat belt.
It is very encouraging that, in such a situation, there are people who are trying to make us safer.
Prices are constantly falling and compulsory equipment can be constantly extended.
Not just seat belts or ecological engines.
Perhaps, in the future, ABS or automatic stability control systems, ASC, may become compulsory.
I would like to congratulate Zita Gurmai on her innovative report.
I am sure that, despite the complicated names and functioning of these items of equipment, the report will be greeted with understanding and support.
We are trying to combat an enormous number of fatal accidents and our political group will support this report, as we did the previous ones that were discussed yesterday by my fellow Members.
<D>
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Kohout, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I must congratulate my fellow Member, Mr Ford, for the quality of his report and his sense of compromise.
We were able to work on this issue in Papua New Guinea during the Joint Parliamentary Assembly of the African, Caribbean and Pacific States, and of the European Union.
I saw him working with members of national parliaments and I am, therefore, happy about that.
I want to join, Commissioner, in the congratulations that have been addressed to you on these Economic Partnership Agreements which have been negotiated with the aim of avoiding any disruption in trade between the ACP States and the European Community.
These negotiations resulted in the Interim Partnership Agreement with the Republic of Fiji and Papua New Guinea, the only States in the Pacific regional grouping that have agreed to the provisional agreement, and we recognise the work needed to conclude full regional agreements.
This agreement includes all the measures necessary to establish a free trade area.
The resolution emphasises that the Economic Partnership Agreement must contribute to strengthening economic growth, regional integration, economic diversification and the alleviation of poverty.
It is important to remember that a genuine regional market represents an essential basis for successfully implementing the Interim Economic Partnership Agreement and that regional integration and cooperation are essential for the social and economic development of the Pacific States.
This agreement is an opportunity to give new impetus to trade relations and guarantees access to the European market with exemption from customs duties and without quotas for most goods.
I should like to insist on the aid of EUR 2 billion to be provided by 2010, and in conclusion, I should like to add that it is very important that there should be no infringement, on the economic level also, of patent rights or of intellectual property rights which affect trade.
With regard to human rights, I am amazed that we have dealings with Papua New Guinea when this country still penalises sexual orientations.
Finally, on the political front, it is important for us to have an alliance with the ACP States within the framework of the World Trade Organisation.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to start by reminding you that the Commission's response to the cyclone last May was quick and substantial.
We provided humanitarian and food aid and worked through the civil protection mechanism in cooperation with the EU Member States.
We are pleased with ASEAN's active role in coordinating international efforts.
The Commission funded the largest part of the needs assessment undertaken jointly by ASEAN, the United Nations and the Government.
The humanitarian emergency is not over, but we will now also look at rehabilitation issues.
Most remarkable during this period has been the outpouring of solidarity among citizens, local NGOs and the Myanmar Red Cross.
This is a clear signal that giving up on civil society is not an option.
The problems that need to be addressed are the following:
Firstly, we must reduce the isolation of the Burmese people.
Civil society needs strengthening.
The Commission is co-hosting a conference on the role of civil society in Myanmar in Brussels, which will take place on 29 October.
Secondly, we must keep open all possible channels of communication with the Government.
At the ASEM Summit, which will take place in Beijing on 26 October, President Barroso is expected to take the floor.
In addition, the Commission has established working relations with line ministries in matters of health, education and livelihoods.
Thirdly, we must keep and strengthen the United Nations as a driving force.
There is no alternative to the good offices of the UN Secretary-General and the UN Special Adviser, Ibrahim Gambari.
The Commission strongly backs the efforts of the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in Myanmar, Mr Tomás Ojea Quintana.
National reconciliation also requires an inclusive dialogue.
It cannot take place with political stakeholders in jail or under house arrest.
We continue to request the release of all those being detained on political grounds.
The Commission also backs the ILO efforts to end forced-labour practices used for military and infrastructural programmes.
The Commission is using all its channels to express concerns regarding forced labour and non-respect for fundamental freedoms.
The people of Myanmar deserve our attention and assistance, and the Commission will continue to do everything in its power.
<D>
President-in-Office of the Council. - (SL) The Council welcomes the interest shown by the European Parliament in the strengthening of the strategic partnership between the European Union and Latin America and the Caribbean.
We are equally pleased with the active role Parliament has had in encouraging concrete commitments towards this region, which would bring considerable benefits to citizens on both sides.
First I should like to congratulate you for establishing the EuroLat joint Parliamentary Assembly, which will play a crucial role in bringing the citizens of both sides together.
The Resolutions that EuroLat adopted during its session in December were a valuable and stimulating contribution to the objectives of the Heads of State or Government from countries on both sides at the summit meeting which is to be held next month.
We are equally pleased, Mr President, that you have expressed your interest in participating in the May EU-LAC Summit.
In this way, with your participation, the good practice introduced at the summit meeting in Vienna in 2006 will be continued.
The European Union and the Latin American and Caribbean countries have agreed that their summit meeting in Lima, under the title 'Addressing our People's Priorities Together', will focus on two key chapters.
Firstly: on poverty, inequality and exclusion, three of the topics representing the key challenges for social cohesion.
And secondly: on environment, climate change and energy - under the title of Sustainable Development.
Regarding the first of the two chapters, poverty, inequality and exclusion, I should like to emphasise that for the European Union social cohesion is of key importance and also an objective which is in line with long-term European traditions.
Social cohesion means all three, it means fighting poverty, inequality and exclusion.
All three components are inextricably connected.
We agree with the Latin American and Caribbean countries that our cooperation should be strengthened in all three areas mentioned.
This is why we intend to devote our attention to the following subjects: social security, taxation policies and their efficiency, productive investments for more jobs and for better jobs, a policy to fight against all forms of discrimination, sexual, ethical, religious or any other, the improvement of basic social services and social security networks, and the quality of education.
A significant aspect of social progress is the provision of suitable jobs.
As you know, all the agreements between the European Union and the Latin American countries and regions contain articles on cooperation in the field of social policy and commitments to respect the so-called primary labour standards, as defined by the International Labour Organization.
During the preparations for the Lima summit meeting, both sides have been looking for ways to encourage jobs which have been defined in this way, especially in small and medium-sized undertakings.
At the same time the Slovenian Presidency has been emphasising that greater investment in education, particularly at elementary and vocational level, is of key importance in improving our countries' competitiveness both in the European Union and in the Latin American and Caribbean countries.
The second key chapter of the approaching summit meeting: sustainable development and environment, climate change and energy.
We emphasise that poverty is closely related with these issues.
Climate change will seriously affect our economies, growth and our policy to reduce poverty.
We already know that the most vulnerable groups will probably suffer the most.
We are aware, both in the European Union and in the Latin American and Caribbean countries, of the safety risks that will be caused by climate change.
We know that failure to act means that the consequences will be much graver than the costs of preventative measures.
From the current discussions concerning the statement that is to be adopted at the summit, it is clearly evident that we shall be jointly addressing numerous aspects of the global challenge.
We shall both have to change examples of unsustainable manufacturing and consumption.
Provisions for concrete and urgent measures for the sustainable management of forests and the use of resources have to be put in place in order to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, to stimulate investments in manufacturing with low carbon dioxide emissions, to preserve biodiversity, for the management of water resources, and the like.
Of course, the European Union and the Latin American and Caribbean countries will also give priority to further cooperation in this field within the framework of the United Nations.
And in conclusion to this introduction, I would like to thank you for your attention.
<D>
Madam President, energy policy and foreign policy are inextricably interlinked now more than ever.
We see the need for a common EU energy policy in the light of the recent developments regarding gas supplies in central and eastern Europe but, whilst it is one of the key innovations of the Lisbon Treaty, I regret to point out that this point was not highlighted sufficiently in the debates surrounding the Treaty's ratification.
In Ireland we have 12 days of gas supply at any one time.
Sixty per cent of our electricity is generated from imported gas, whereas the EU average is around 40%.
On 28 January last, the Commission published a proposal to accelerate work on addressing deficits in the EU energy infrastructure while contributing to economic recovery as part of a EUR 5 billion package.
The inclusion by the Commission of the electricity interconnection between Ireland and the UK as a priority area for funding under the European economic recovery package is a very welcome development in this regard.
It further emphasises that when all 27 Member States work together we can bring about the change that is required to ensure security of energy supply.
(The President cut off the speaker.)
<D>
Member of the Commission. - (ES) Mr President, I should like to thank all the Members who have spoken in this debate.
I believe that, from this debate, we can conclude that there is a very broad consensus in favour of the report under discussion, together with very broad support for continuing with the Economic and Monetary Union project and also in favour of our single currency.
I am not saying this out of a desire to repeat the reasons given by those of us who supported the creation of Economic and Monetary Union 10 years ago, but due to the analysis of what has happened in that decade and of what we must do now, in these very difficult economic times.
Of course, the current problems cannot be attributed to the euro.
As we all know, the causes of this very deep crisis do not lie here in Europe or in the euro area.
However, it is clear that we are paying the price, as are other industrialised countries, emerging economies and developing countries.
This is because, in a global economy, decoupling is not possible.
However, with Economic and Monetary Union, we at least have the instruments to tackle the problems more effectively.
We believe that we will be able to get out of this crisis quicker if we work together than if each country tries to go it alone.
I agree with all those - and there have been many - who have said that the European Central Bank is an institution which, since its creation, has more than adequately justified the trust that we placed in it in the Maastricht Treaty.
I believe that it has done its work very well and that this work should be supported, because it is an essential part of Economic and Monetary Union.
I also agree with all those who have said that the Stability and Growth Pact should be maintained as it is now, following the 2005 revision, so that we can use the flexibility introduced in that year and debated here on many occasions.
This flexibility will enable us to maintain budgetary discipline and the rules of budgetary discipline.
It will enable us to anchor the sustainability objectives of our public accounts.
However, at the same time, it will enable us to use our fiscal policy in a situation requiring an active policy in terms of taxation and fiscal policy instruments.
The fiscal stimulus must be coordinated so that it is effective.
Our framework of budgetary discipline makes this coordination easier, but it also imposes limits to prevent the coordination of a fiscal stimulus from jeopardising the sustainability of our public accounts.
Thirdly - and many speakers have mentioned this today - we undoubtedly have to reinforce the voice of the euro in defending the stability of our currency and in bilateral and multilateral relations with holders of our currency, with those representing other currencies and, in particular, with the other currencies of the major players in the global economy.
This crisis ultimately stems from macroeconomic imbalances which should have been tackled but which could not be tackled due to a lack of effective mechanisms for solving global imbalances.
We discussed this in Washington and we must keep discussing it.
We can only do this effectively, as Europeans, if we give the euro our full political support and the necessary governance mechanisms so that our interests can be defended, as they deserve to be, through the exchange rate for our currency.
I believe that this is the road to take, as stated in the report, as has been said by the President of the Eurogroup, as agreed by the Commission and as, in coming months, the leaders of the Member States will also increasingly agree.
This requires coordination, provided that it is the right kind of coordination.
It does not mean challenging the independence of the European Central Bank or artificially coordinating economic policy decisions, which must continue to be made according to the circumstances of each country.
That is not real coordination.
It must be the coordination that has always been behind the economic branch of Economic and Monetary Union, which is coordination serving the objectives of Economic and Monetary Union, in both macroeconomic policies and in the link which must exist between macroeconomic policies and structural policies.
When we in the Commission talk about coordination, we are talking about this type of coordination.
I feel that, in the current circumstances, the risk of recession that we are facing shows that this coordination is a priority and that Economic and Monetary Union gives us the instruments to achieve this.
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (SL) Climate change mitigation and energy are two important components of the European Union's development policy.
And so they should be.
I am pleased with any initiative that may help a secure and sustainable energy supply, not only in Europe but also in third countries.
Allow me to express some doubts, which we have to dispel before we set up this fund.
Firstly, the number of initiatives in the area of energy and development policies is growing steadily.
Sadly, the desired results are relatively rarely achieved.
The initiatives in the shape of various funds are not mutually harmonised and, above all, they rarely finance individual projects directly.
The latter also applies to the fund under discussion, which should operate via the setting-up and financing of regional sub-funds in developing countries.
We should consider how it will affect the transparency of the use of resources, and to what extent the institutional conditions in developing countries will facilitate their intended use.
Secondly, only timely actions can be effective.
In the case of the proposed world fund, appropriate timing is not in evidence.
The proposal was made in 2006 and we are debating it only this year.
Thirdly, I would like to stress the fact cited in the document itself: the resources intended for the fund are not sufficient.
Not even the minimum sum envisaged for successful operation of the fund has been secured.
That will hardly help to stimulate investment by the private sector.
Fourthly, I find it difficult to imagine that the fund can be operated effectively merely by cooperation between the Union and international financial institutions.
Our proposal lacks a clear ambition and plan for cooperation with other industrialised countries in the world and internationalisation of the world fund.
As was said before, the idea is welcome, but its added value and actual realisation have yet to be thought through.
<D>
We have, today, reached a decision on the election of the European Ombudsman.
This election is extremely important for the citizens of the European Union, because the European Ombudsman deals with the protection of human rights.
He examines complaints made by EU citizens about improprieties in European institutions.
In this way, Europeans have a certain kind of control over every body, office, institution and agency of the Union.
Therefore, it is extremely important that our citizens be aware of their rights.
They need to know that, following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, their influence on the functioning of EU institutions has increased.
In addition, according to the new ombudsman, the European Ombudsman is going to work more closely with other European institutions.
It is also pleasing that citizens of the new Member States are making use of the possibility to lodge a complaint, which is testified by the relatively high number of complaints recorded in previous years.
This shows that the residents of the new Member States are interested in issues connected with the European Union and are not indifferent to the EU.
<D>
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen.
The energy sector represents a major economic and geopolitical factor.
Nowadays, almost half of the EU's energy is dependent on imports, with the forecasts indicating to us that imports will account for 70% of the natural gas supply and 100% of the oil supply by 2030.
These must be the main motives for us to devise a common energy policy as a matter of urgency.
This requires us to base the implementation of a common energy policy on three pillars: interconnecting the national networks completely at EU level, diversifying our supply sources and adopting active measures aimed at saving energy.
All of these measures must also result in avoiding energy crises like the current crisis involving the gas supplied by Russia through Ukraine, which is creating major problems for the EU's population and is disrupting its economy.
Is it really possible to steal gas from a network like a wallet from a pocket?
Is it really possible to cut off a supply just like that, in a couple of minutes, without notifying the user beforehand?
I think that before examining the non-compliance with international treaties and agreements and the fact that the supplier which receives the largest share of its revenue from gas exports treats Europeans, who are paying reliably for this gas, with indifference and disinterest, we must look at solutions for the EU's energy security.
<D>
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, the discussion about safety marks has been going on for years.
Since states are duty bound to protect their citizens against life- or health-threatening products, some of them introduced regulations subjecting certain categories of goods to various requirements such as markings and certificates, and the relevant national authorities were made responsible for monitoring and supervision.
In the European Union the CE mark is compulsory for a large group of goods.
It certifies that the product is safe, and it must be affixed equally to an iron costing only EUR 5 and to one that costs EUR 50.
So there is not much point in adding a plus/minus symbol.
The procedures for affixing the CE mark meet with no great objections.
The problem is the unlawful introduction of changes to products already marked by manufacturers, the unlawful affixing of the CE mark and the addition - without a proper certification procedure - of similar products to certificates already obtained.
What the EU needs, therefore, is better synchronisation of the measures taken by all consumer protection institutions.
Its borders must be sealed to ensure that uncertified products do not reach the market, an efficient monitoring and information system must be established, and a more stringent and uniform system of penalties introduced to ensure that circumvention of the CE system does not pay off.
Given the high cost of certification, small and medium-sized enterprises in the European Union should receive support in obtaining the relevant markings.
The UEN Group supports all measures designed to ensure consumer protection and the efficient operation of the European market.
<D>
in writing. - (FR) I am truly sorry that the excellent proposal for a resolution on the future of European space policy, which has just been passed, makes no reference to the Kourou space centre.
The space history of Europe inevitably passes via Guyana.
It is so obvious to everyone that we no longer think of pointing out that all the Ariane rockets are assembled there and are launched from this launch pad.
My thanks to the French Presidency, represented by Mr Jean-Pierre Jouyet, who had the presence of mind to mention it during yesterday's debate.
To my mind, European space strategy must without fail incorporate proper consideration of future developments of the European Spaceport, both in terms of infrastructure and staff and in terms of research projects.
The Kourou site is the window of the European space programme.
Guyana, which is an outermost region of the European Union, deserves to be recognised for its past and future contribution to this strategic policy.
I would have liked to see this House pay homage to the Guyana space centre and explicitly express the pride which it inspires in all Europeans.
In just a few decades, Kourou has become a major constituent element of our European identity.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - The method of the calculation of greenhouse gas emission from biofuels compared to fossil fuel emission contained in the Renewable Energy Directive follows what we call the life cycle approach, which also takes into account the level of emission produced during transport of biofuels both within and outside the European Union.
In this respect let me reiterate once more that reducing greenhouse gas emission from transport is one of the guiding objectives of the biofuel policy.
Subject: European food aid programme for the most deprived persons
In 2005, the European Parliament approved a written declaration on the durability of the European food aid programme for the most deprived persons.
The declaration not only advocated a permanent food aid programme plus an annual budget, but also called for it to be expanded.
To ensure distribution of balanced food rations, the European Parliament called for the programme to be opened up to new sectors such as pork, poultry and eggs.
Mariann Fischer Boel, European Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, was tasked with following up the declaration.
That fact is that, three years later, there is still no sign of a basis for a new regulation and that only modest steps have been taken.
As yet, it is totally unclear what budget funding is available.
Food aid is very much an issue in the European Union, where 16% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Can the Commission ensure a food aid programme at European level?
In the process, will it enter into a dialogue with the European NGOs active in the field?
<D>
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I would also like to thank Mr Florenz, in particular for his patience in the negotiations.
The length of the report is evidence of the huge number of issues there were to deal with.
However, I would also like to pose the question of how sustainable the agreement is that is now being signalled at the beginning of this year by this report.
I remember the International Climate Conference in Poznań very well and the very weak role that the Europeans played there, because they were preoccupied with adjusting downwards their ambitious promises and ambitious statements from the international round of negotiations in Bali and, in view of the emerging financial and economic crisis, they were busy relegating climate policy to a lower priority.
I believe that the next year will be decisive as regards the question of whether we really are prepared, as we currently keep promising, to adjust the type of economy to which we in the industrial nations have become accustomed on the basis of our knowledge of climate change.
I believe that the decision as to whether or not we will go down the road of sustainability has not yet been made.
In Poznań, Ban Ki-Moon and Achim Steiner recommended very strongly that all measures taken by the Member States in their economic stimulus plans and their bank rescue packages now be combined with programmes to combat poverty in developing countries and the dreadful consequences of climate change in developing countries, and also with measures for a really ambitious level of climate protection and a new energy policy.
I can see that any legislation at European level relating to this issue will be establishing new ground.
It is by no means certain that Europe will find its way along the road to a modern society of energy efficiency and renewable energies.
Now, as before, it all rests on the decision: do we carry on with the old mix of coal and nuclear energy or do we take ambitious new paths?
I hope that we continue to address this issue as constructively as we have done in the Temporary Committee on Climate Change, although I am not certain that that will happen.
<D>
(CS) Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Montenegro has made visible progress during its short existence.
The foundations have been laid for a new state and a new constitution has been adopted.
The country's economy is showing strong growth of 8% and inward investment has this year been in the order of EUR 700 million.
The Stabilisation and Association Agreement has been signed and Montenegro has taken its first steps on its way to full membership of the EU.
If, however, its path to membership of the EU is to be as short and fast as possible, Podgorica should make some fundamental decisions.
It is necessary to reinforce the functioning of the rule of law and guarantee among other things an independent judiciary.
It is also necessary - with more conviction than in the past - to combat corruption and increase transparency in decision-making in political and economic structures with a view to guaranteeing the democratic and equitable functioning of the market economy.
Tourism has a fundamental significance for the economy of Montenegro.
Its sustainability must be guaranteed by adopting a unified legislative framework for the protection of the natural environment and the coastline.
Ladies and gentlemen, the accession process of Montenegro and its neighbours facilitates much greater development of regional cooperation.
I am convinced that regional cooperation in the context of CEFTA will also help to solve many political, economic and social issues in the area as a whole.
I would like to conclude my speech by inviting the Commission to help Montenegro and other Western Balkan states to develop regional cooperation, primarily in the areas of energy, transport and the environment.

on behalf of the Greens/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, all the court judgments concern cases in which the trade unions have taken internationally recognised collective measures for action against social dumping.
In all three judgments the European Court of Justice recognised that the trade unions had a legitimate right to take these measures.
The Court of Justice, however, challenged this right in relation to the internal market.
In the Laval and Rüffert cases, the legal minimum standard was interpreted as the only maximum standard valid on the internal market.
The European Court of Justice therefore interpreted the Posting of Workers Directive in a very specific way.
The legislator did not, however, intend it that way.
In considering the Directive, the free trade in services must be promoted in fair competition and employees' rights must be guaranteed.
The Posting of Workers Directive also contains a most-favoured nation clause for employees and this was not taken into account in the court judgments.
The Court of Justice is now creating a situation in the European Union in which the Posting of Workers Directive has been changed from a minimum directive to a maximum directive and in which it is legitimate to assert a competitive advantage over social dumping.
International social law should now be subject to charges for enterprises on the free internal market.
It may be that I am thereby criticising the court judgments.
However, a Union without equivalent elements of a social Europe, such as collective bargaining agreements, collective measures and combating social dumping, is doomed to failure and will no longer have the citizens' support.
Our group's response therefore at this point is: the principle of 'equal pay for equal work in the same establishment' must occupy an equivalent position in the internal market with regard to the criteria of freedom.
<D>
Mr President, this has, I think, been a very good solution and I am grateful for your courtesy towards myself and my colleague.
For my part, I simply appreciate all the speeches and thanks, especially some speeches that were kind to the report, and the collaboration from the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on my report.
I would like to mention Mr Rogalski's speech in particular.
As the Member representing the region of the Balearic Islands and as a Spanish Member, I must say that you can be quite sure that the reason why I took this report was to help those people, those older people who are now living on our islands in Spain as residents or tourists.
I consider it essential that they should have that protection.
Nobody will therefore have failed to notice that I included my own country in the aspiration that it may shortly ratify and sign the Hague Convention.
I only differ from the Minister on one point.
As you have seen, I have not mentioned any other presidencies.
I join everyone else in saying that, in the end, we would have liked this French Presidency to have lasted much longer.
For many of us it was too short.
That was my only difference of opinion.
<D>
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, Commissioner, on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, I should like to thank both rapporteurs very much for their work.
The term cohesion has acquired special significance within the Union.
References to the need to reduce differences between the various regions in order to unite national economies and support their harmonious development date back to the Treaty of Rome.
The Fourth Report covers the years 2000-2006.
It is the subject of the Guellec report, which contains many valuable findings.
This report presents a summary of the situation in all the Member States.
It also highlights the areas where disparities are greatest.
Narrowing disparities in those regions must be perceived as a long-term undertaking.
The report tabled by the Commission contains many comparative parameters that were lacking in earlier documents.
The suggestion of using indicators supplementing basic GDP per capita in relation to different NUTS levels remains, however.
Cohesion policy is the foundation of integration and makes a valuable contribution to the harmonious development of the Union.
Its regional, local and environmental aspects are important in this context, as Mrs Staniszewska has already mentioned.
We should also recognise its impact on the Union's innovation and competitiveness, and therefore on implementation of the Lisbon Strategy.
Demographic issues are important too, as certain areas are threatened with depopulation.
When we refer to cohesion we perceive it as economic and social.
A sound definition of the term territorial cohesion is urgently required.
Cohesion should be understood as ensuring that, regardless of where they reside, Union citizens enjoy equal opportunities for access to health services, education, culture, the Internet and transport, for example.
Cohesion policy should be strengthened and improved with adequate Union resources.
The urban aspect is particularly important, as Mrs Kallenbach pointed out.
The question as to how to choose between cohesion or competitiveness, equality or efficiency has recently arisen.
My brief answer is to choose both, in due measure.
<D>
Mr President, Mr Solano, Commissioner, as I listened nearly a month ago to the children of Gaza speak, amongst the ruins of their house, of how they had trembled as the bombs fell, or to their parents describe the hell of those 22 days and nights that will forever mark their lives and the memory of future generations, I was not proud of Europe.
I thought of some of the leaders of our Member States, of all those who will answer to history for their lack of political courage, the missed opportunities, for their lack of vision.
I asked myself this question: to what extremes must the Israeli leaders push their inhumanity towards the Palestinians and their scorn for law and the most fundamental values before the main European political leaders dare to raise a finger and say finally, 'Enough is enough'?
Those who call themselves friends of Israel to justify the impunity and unlimited accommodation shown towards its current ruling class should reflect on these words from the great Israeli writer David Grossman, whom I wish to quote: 'Amidst the wave of nationalist hyperbole now sweeping the nation, it would not hurt to recall that in the final analysis, this last operation in Gaza is just another stop along a trail blazing with fire, violence and hatred.
A trail marked at times by victory, at other times by defeat, but which is leading us inevitably to ruin'.
Or let them ask the same question as Shlomo Sand, the famous Israeli historian, whom I also quote: 'We sowed desolation.
We have proved that we have no moral reserve.
Have we strengthened the peace camp among Palestinians?'
He continues: 'Israel has been pushing the Palestinians to despair.'
For 20 years, Yasser Arafat and the Palestinian Authority recognised the State of Israel with nothing to show in return.
Israel refused the offer of the Arab League in 2002, ladies and gentlemen.
Everyone talks about the Arab League and about the Arab League's peace project.
It has been in existence for seven years.
What has Europe done to seize this opportunity?
I therefore come back to Shlomo Sand: 'Israel refused the offer of the Arab League in 2002 of full recognition of Israel with the pre-1967 borders.'
The Israeli historian concludes thus: 'Israel will make peace only if pressure is brought to bear on its policies'.
This leads to a question, Mr Solano, as you said nothing on the subject of international law.
What pressure is the Union prepared to exert on Israel over Gaza and the West Bank, including Jerusalem, to remind its current and future leaders that membership of the international community in general, and the privileged partnership with the European Union in particular, come at a price, that they have no place for military occupation, nor war crimes, nor a policy which pushes each day towards a divorce between Europe and the Arab-Muslim world?
I would wish, as a European, not to have to place the hope for a change in policy towards the Near East solely on the occupant of the White House.
I would still like to believe in an about-turn by Europe.
(Applause)
<D>
(NL) Neighbours look after one another, they support each other.
When things are good in the neighbourhood, they are also good for the people who live there.
Turkey and Cyprus are neighbours.
When they look over each others' fences, it is not each other they see, but the Turkish Cypriots, who find themselves caught between two stools.
In order to ensure that all the people who live on Cyprus are once again truly able to live together, a solution is needed that requires all the neighbours to play their part.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon last week indicated a belief that a solution for Cyprus is possibly within reach.
This Parliament has an important job to do in making a positive contribution to the situation on Cyprus, searching constructively for solutions and clearing obstacles instead of erecting them.
Yes, Turkey must be made to make efforts to bring that solution closer.
That is what we are calling for in the report on which we are about to vote.
It is not just Turkey that has to make an effort, however.
All the affected parties must play their part in creating a positive atmosphere in which a reliable solution can be found.
Ultimately, that is, of course, what we all want: a solution.
We must also be supportive in connection with the candidate country of Macedonia, when it comes to the issue of its name, so that negotiations can begin.
As Member States, we must be careful to ensure that we are not part of the problem, but that we instead contribute to finding a solution.
The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has made a great deal of progress, and can act as an example for the other countries of the Balkans, whilst also offering an opportunity to increase stability in the region.
We need to make an effort, here, to see the EU's most important export products flourish: democracy, human rights, peace and security.
<D>
in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this very important resolution on European pension systems.
Europe is ageing and due to the worsening of the demographic situation and the declining birth rate, the number of people of retirement age is constantly rising.
The importance of social security and pension funds is therefore undoubtedly increasing, particularly given the current economic crisis.
People have to feel safe in their old age, and this can only be achieved with stable, well functioning pension systems.
There are currently 100 different pension systems in the European Union.
Due to major differences across the Member States, EU citizens feel unequal.
People who have worked hard all their lives, particularly in the new EU Member States, receive different sized pensions compared to citizens in the old EU Member States.
This makes them feel like second-class citizens.
Undoubtedly, the regulation of pension systems is a Member State issue, but it is clear that there needs to be more European Union coordination in this area.
The EU must care for those who need help most: the disabled, the unemployed and people of retirement age.
In the interests of the welfare of its citizens and through the Member States, the European Union must try to level out pension systems.
This would undoubtedly contribute to improving people's living standards and the EU's economic growth.
<D>
rapporteur. - (SV) Mr President, Commissioner, the fact that taxes at EU level are a sensitive subject is demonstrated by the work on this report.
I thought that the broad consensus on the need to do something radical in order to cope with the demands of climate change would make it easier to gain sympathy for some really tough proposals.
That was not how things turned out.
Of course I can understand Mrs Rühle's criticism of the level of ambition, but at the same time the work in our Parliament focuses on reaching reasonable compromises - something the Commissioner also mentioned - which can be implemented throughout our Union.
Here I yielded to arguments regarding both the scale of the tax increases and the period of implementation.
Excellent cooperation from my colleagues, Mr Becsey and Mr Rosati, led me to realise that, if we were to get a report through at all, I had to adjust the level without the purpose of my original proposals being entirely frustrated.
The Commission's proposal was rejected in its entirety.
I did not gain everything, but nor did I lose everything.
Navigating between the rocks of Luxembourg and the Greens was not an altogether simple matter.
Emissions from transport are increasing substantially.
We must do something about that.
The fact that the EU Member States are competing with different levels of tax on diesel is therefore neither reasonable nor right, as the Commissioner correctly indicates.
No one can think that it is good for the internal market that giant lorries should make long detours in order to fill up with cheap diesel in places such as Luxembourg.
This so-called fuel tourism is not only bad for the environment, it distorts competition as well.
Besides, it leads to losses of tax revenue.
Moreover, there is no reason to have separate taxes on unleaded petrol and diesel.
So a compromise was reached here, which got more or less unanimous support in the committee.
The minimum taxes on diesel are raised more slowly than proposed by the Commission, from 302 euros per 1 000 litres at present to the same level as the tax on unleaded petrol, 359 euros per 1 000 litres, by 2015.
The Commission wanted to see an increase already in 2012.
Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Bulgaria and Romania would be given until 1 January 2016 to introduce the higher minimum tax.
The Commission wants to raise the minimum tax to 380 euros per 1 000 litres by 2014.
In order to avoid further distortion of competition, the committee considers that those countries which have tax rates of over 400 euros per 1 000 litres on diesel and 500 euros per 1 000 litres on unleaded petrol should not raise their tax rates on these fuels before 2015.
Mr President, Commissioner, clearly this is a very sensitive question, in particular having regard to subsidiarity.
Nevertheless it is a possible way forward towards increased convergence of tax levels.
At the same time, we know that inevitable environmental demands will exert an influence on future assessments of the use of financial controls.
To those who do not think I have been sufficiently tough in my demands and that I have chipped away at the level of ambition I will say: in substance, I am with you.
We should have agreed on higher levels and shorter implementation periods, as the Commission and the Commissioner have said, but the EU today is not the same EU as it was only five years ago - happily, I would add.
The economic preconditions for harmonising taxes are not the same as they were.
If we are to tackle cross-border emissions, we must find reasonable compromises with which everyone can live.
We must all realise that.
Besides, I would add that many of the old Member States merit criticism since they have not followed decisions on tax increases taken previously.
Purchasing power and inflation considerations have also been taken into account in the committee's conclusions.
The price of oil is currently hitting new records.
I last heard on the news that it was close to 110 dollars a barrel.
Now there is broad agreement on gradual tax convergence which I also hope the Commissioner sees - at least in the committee - and I hope to get the support of my colleagues in the House tomorrow, broad support so that we can get a report that can serve as a basis for further work.
<D>
The Stockholm Programme establishes ambitious European policies on justice and security in order to build a citizens' Europe.
The objectives include a legislative proposal on reinforced cooperation with regard to the law applicable to divorce.
In Europe, 20% of divorces concern international couples.
Such divorces are sometimes marred by endless red tape and a lack of clear responses from national systems.
In many cases, the children and the weakest spouse suffer most from the emotional stresses and strains arising from legal action.
Where possible, the best solution would be to set up a system of mediation, namely an amicable agreement between the parties.
It would be appropriate to refer for this purpose to the concepts defined in Directive 2008/52/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2008 on certain aspects of mediation in civil and commercial matters and the European code of conduct for mediators.
It will also be important for all citizens to gain access to up-to-date, high quality information now available in a Commission database on essential aspects of national and EU law and procedures concerned not only with separation and divorce but also mediation.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the Commission remains very concerned about the dire humanitarian situation in the Kivus, and North Kivu in particular, where the number of internally displaced people - currently exceeding 800 000 in North Kivu alone - has as much as doubled in the course of 2007, thus alarmingly increasing the vulnerability of the population already suffering hardship.
At the same time, we are aware of, and condemn, the severe human rights abuses - including recruitment of child soldiers and widespread sexual violence - taking place in the region.
Yet, in this context, it is important to remember that today's critical situation in North Kivu, while exacerbated by the fighting taking place in the second half of 2007, is a result of years of war in the region.
The root causes of the Kivu conflict can be traced all the way to the Rwandan genocide at the beginning of the 1990s, while also bearing in mind that there are several local components - such as insufficient political representation of ethnic minorities, pillaging of natural resources and land tenure issues - that significantly contribute to the instability and insecurity in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.
That is why the Commission welcomes the recent Goma Peace Conference and the following cease-fire as positive steps towards solving the enduring conflict in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.
The Conference restored President Kabila's credibility after the army's defeat against General Nkunda's troops at the end of 2007, and launched an inter-provincial dialogue process - something that the Commission has always advocated.
Moreover, along the lines of the commitments made by the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda in their Nairobi Joint Communiqué in November 2007, the Goma Conference also re-emphasised the need to tackle the problem of the ex-FAR as a priority.
At the same time, it was made clear that there is a need to address the root causes of the conflict, while restoring the State authority in the east.
That said, it should not be forgotten that nothing was definitively solved at Goma or Nairobi.
Finding a permanent solution to the root causes of the Kivu crisis, and thus a sustainable restoration of peace in the region, will take time.
Indeed, while complementing each other, the Nairobi Joint Communiqué and the Goma Conference represent an encouraging start - but only a start - of a difficult and lengthy process.
The main challenge ahead is now an effective implementation of the Nairobi and Goma commitments.
It ought to be assured that all the concerned stakeholders stand by their commitments.
The EU will continue to follow closely and participate actively in this process.
In this context, international action in support of the Congolese is very much needed.
The Commission, together with the Member States, is ready to continue to play an important role in the Kivus.
We have traditionally been one of the most important donors in the east, via our humanitarian assistance and our rehabilitation and capacity-building programmes.
We are willing to further increase our support for the region, especially through European initiatives, as well as in close collaboration with the United Nations.
<D>
Mr President, what disturbs me most about the change to the law introduced in Afghanistan is that women have had their right to medical treatment taken away.
This is a result of the ban on going out of the home without the husband's permission and also of the ban on undergoing medical examination.
Afghanistan is a country where, as a result of many years of civil war, the state of hospitals and their equipment is catastrophic.
Access to water is hindered because of the deployment of landmines.
Hygiene skills and knowledge about how to manage minor ailments without medical help are no longer passed from one generation to the next, as was traditionally the case.
Mothers do not pass on to young women the fact that camomile can be used when bathing a baby, because of its disinfectant properties.
All too often the mothers have simply been murdered.
In addition to this dramatic situation, the obstruction of access to a doctor or a healthcare facility could have catastrophic consequences for an entire generation.
We should strive to resolve this problem, in spite of cultural differences.
<D>
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr Posselt, Professor Ukshin Hoti is one of more than 2 000 people included on the list of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) whose families reported their disappearance during the Kosovo conflict.
The ICRC has, since January 1998, been gathering information on people who disappeared in Kosovo.
This information has been sent to the authorities in Belgrade and Pristina, together with a request for them to do their utmost to discover the whereabouts of these people.
The ICRC in Kosovo is also working on this issue in strict cooperation with the United Nations Missions in Kosovo.
As part of the dialogue on issues of mutual interest between Pristina and Belgrade, the working group on missing persons which has representatives in both governments has met periodically since March 2004 under the auspices of the Red Cross.
Work is being carried out on both sides in order to discover the whereabouts of missing persons, but progress is slow.
The right to know the whereabouts of missing loved ones is a fundamental issue of humanitarian law and human rights.
As a result, the Council of the European Union is supporting the work being carried out by the international and local authorities in Serbia and Kosovo to this end and is encouraging them to increase their efforts.
<D>
(SK) The ever-growing number of counterfeit and pirated products on the international market increases the possibility of a threat to the sustainable development of the world economy, and undoubtedly also brings financial losses to the original manufacturers as well as infringing on the intellectual property of authors and subjects involved in manufacturing and production.
It also clearly presents a risk to consumers and is the cause of job losses in Europe.
The idea of a multilateral agreement to combat piracy and counterfeiting may be an effective mechanism for curbing such activities.
However, I join my colleagues in emphasising the need for transparency and better credibility in any such negotiations and agreements.
I consider it equally essential that a balance be struck between the rights we are interested in protecting and the rights that are essential in society.
The enforcement or protection of the rights of some must not encroach on the rights and justified interests of others.
I refer, in particular, to the provisions of the agreement which intend to criminalise completely harmless ordinary users but will not penalise the big players.
It seems absurd to me that during border controls, technical equipment containing audio and video recordings for personal use may be confiscated.
In our legal tradition, copying for personal use without commercial purposes is common and not illegal.
Commissioner, why should a student, for example, be unable to make a copy of a book he needs for school?
Once again, I stress that we need to give the green light to acceptable copyright protection.
However, behind the current version of ACTA is the work of the lobbyists of US recording companies who, in their pursuit of profit, intend to terrorise and criminalise a large part of our society, and the citizens of the Member States of the European Union in particular.
I consider the astronomical fines, inappropriate checks, negotiations on the agreement behind closed doors, and so on disproportionate.
Therefore, I would like to ask the European Commission to resist the enormous pressure from the lobbyists and prepare a rational and well-balanced alternative to the current version of ACTA.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I welcome the opportunity to address this part-session of the European Parliament covering, inter alia, the subject of the Commission's assessment of the National Energy Efficiency Action Plans (NEEAPs), which was presented in the Second Strategic Energy Review package in November 2008 and the earlier Commission communication of January 2008.
A more detailed technical synthesis of the Commission's assessment of the NEEAPs will be presented in the Commission's NEEAP document this spring.
I would, therefore, like to take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur, Mr Gyürk, on his work, as well as the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE) for its valuable discussions and comments.
In the past few years, the Commission has stated very clearly that energy efficiency is the first priority of the European Union energy policy and a very important cornerstone to meeting the 2020 by 2020 targets, and National Energy Efficiency Action Plans play a central role in this respect.
The Directive on energy end-use efficiency and energy services sets an obligation, as you know, for the Member States to present these, and to show how, in practice, they are going to achieve their national targets for energy efficiency.
The original deadline for their submission by the Member States was 30 June 2007 but, as you know, many Member States unfortunately were late.
The last NEEAPs arrived at the Commission in June 2008.
At this stage, the Commission has completed all the individual assessments and sent letters with the results of those assessments to all Member States.
As a follow-up, a number of bilateral meetings took place, and a number of Member States declared they would themselves like to improve their NEEAPs in the coming few months.
As has been noted by the members of the ITRE Committee, the first National Energy Efficiency Action Plans have proved to be a really useful exercise.
Indeed, many Member States have, for the first time, prepared comprehensive plans of action on energy savings.
Many of them confirmed that they found the cross-sectoral effort needed to prepare them very useful.
Under the Energy Services Directive, NEEAPs have only a limited role.
However, the Commission, in its communication of November 2008, and in other recent statements has always encouraged Member States to broaden their role.
The Commission will prepare a new European Union Energy Savings Action Plan that will strengthen and better focus European Union actions, helping EU Member States and EU businesses and EU citizens to save energy in a cost-effective way.
In your report, you urged the Commission to propose a binding target for energy savings.
The current energy savings objective of 20% of primary energy saving in 2020 today represents a non-binding target, as you know.
However, the Commission believes that, with the climate and energy package, as well as the proposals in the Second Strategic Energy Review, we can reach 20%.
Mr Gyürk's report also rightly indicated that financial support must be increased.
Financial issues relating to energy savings were recognised by the Commission in the European Economic Recovery Plan of 26 November 2008, and in other coordinated efforts which aim to help create jobs, which are often in small and medium-sized companies, since investments in energy efficiency, and especially in buildings, are mostly related to small-scale renovation projects.
In conclusion, I would like to recall that during the mandate of this Commission, EU leaders have given a real commitment to promoting energy efficiency.
Boosting investment in energy efficiency and related new technologies offers an essential contribution to sustainable development and also to security of supply.
Energy efficiency has a wider impact, far beyond energy policy.
It has a positive effect on the European Union economy in general: increasing efficiency helps create new jobs, stimulates economic growth and improves competitiveness.
As you rightly mentioned, that is exactly what we should be doing in these difficult and challenging times.
<D>
(SV) Madam President, I think that at this stage in the debate there is no longer any doubt of the importance of visa liberalisation to the citizens of the Balkans.
The ability to travel freely is, along with education, perhaps the most important tool that we can offer the new generations, of whom we expect so much commitment to the democratisation process throughout the region.
Consequently, I welcome the proposal on visa liberalisation for Serbia, Macedonia and Montenegro.
The progress of any individual country on its journey towards the EU represents progress for the whole of the Balkans.
Some of these countries have had to wait a long time; some perhaps longer than necessary.
We in the European Parliament and the two countries not yet included in visa liberalisation should learn lessons from this.
Although this is a highly sensitive political issue, I would like to point out that the rules on visa liberalisation are clear and universal.
The conditions must be met.
Let us not make this more of a political issue than is necessary, however.
Let us look at what remains to be done and how we can ensure as quickly as possible that Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania are soon also able to join the family of visa-free countries.
Bosnia and Herzegovina has made great progress recently and will soon have fulfilled most of the remaining requirements in the roadmap.
I therefore call on the players in Bosnia and Herzegovina to adopt the anti-corruption act and lay down rules for the exchange of information between the different parts of the police service as quickly as possible.
I urge them to try to ensure that this work is completed by the end of September, before a report is sent back to the Commission.
In its new analysis, I then expect the Commission in turn to judge what progress has actually been made and, once the EU's requirements have been met, to propose that the Council approve visa liberalisation for Bosnia and Herzegovina.
I hope that this can take effect in July 2010.
<D>
(DE) Madam President, Mr Swoboda's report is encouraging, realistic and balanced.
I congratulate him on it.
It shows the progress Croatia has made, such as its exemplary legislation on minorities, its constructive cooperation with the Hague Tribunal, its increased commitment to fighting corruption, and above all the agreement of Parliament and government regarding the fishing zone, which has been particularly difficult to achieve.
Croatia and the European Commission now have to bring all their resources to bear to negotiate the forthcoming chapters quickly and satisfactorily.
An international arbitrator should have the opportunity at long last to resolve the border issues between Slovenia and Croatia.
Croatia has a key role to play in the region and should be admitted to the European Union soon.
Bilateral issues must not be an obstacle.
With regard to Macedonia, I can tell you that I was at a conference there at the weekend and the mood is really very agitated following the rejection by NATO.
People feel they have been unfairly treated.
Mr Meijer's report shows the stony path the country has already successfully trodden.
There is certainly a great deal still to do, but when the naming issue continually hangs over everything like the Sword of Damocles it is difficult to move on in other areas of policy.
I have been monitoring the situation there since 1992 and would like Macedonia and Greece to find a solution at long last to the dispute regarding the name, particularly for the young generation.
Both sides have made concessions in recent weeks and both must take another step closer to each other.
I would find it incompatible with our European values and actually irresponsible if a veto were once again to provide the opportunity to bar the country from joining the European Union.
This must not happen!
<D>
- Madam President, this is a dreadful piece of legislation.
It is dreadful, because it criminalises the employer and does not criminalise the illicit immigrant.
It is nonsense.
This will create a sense of foreboding among all employers whenever they have to employ somebody.
Can you imagine what will happen when a potential employer looks at a potential employee and starts asking questions which are of a very intrusive nature?
In addition, this has nothing at all to do with the European Union.
This ought to be a matter for national legislation and national governments - for the national parliaments of individual Member States to decide whom they want and do not want in their countries.
To criminalise national employers at a time of deepening recession is absurd.
This piece of legislation should never see the light of day.
<D>
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (SV) Mr President, hunting is an old-established custom.
Every Member State has its unique hunting tradition to protect.
Today's debate therefore represents the conclusion to a long process.
Strong wills have opposed one another, many discussions have taken place and the shadow rapporteur has been barred from taking part in the tripartite meetings.
Many of the original proposals could have threatened the hunting cultures of Member States.
Regrettably, the European Firearms Pass did not suffice as the only document needed for the occasional use of hunting and marksmen's weapons in another Member State.
Freedom of movement is prevented by the fact that certain Member States are permitted to require additional documents.
Huntsmen and marksmen from the Community will be subject to greater bureaucracy than persons from third countries.
Fortunately fees for such permits have been prohibited.
In the course of the process, as shadow rapporteur, I tried to influence the final report on those occasions when I was permitted to participate in the meetings.
My work focused mainly on two questions.
I was concerned to prevent a ban on ordering weapons on the Internet and to forestall changes in the availability of exemptions for schools offering training in nature management and marksmanship.
In remote regions a ban on the purchase of weapons on the internet would prevent access to weapons for hunting purposes.
In Sweden today we have good regulations on internet purchases, which are accepted by both the hunting community and the authorities.
The second question was about the minimum age criteria, which would affect various types of upper secondary school programme.
In Sweden training in hunting performs an important function in teaching future generations about hunting and game conservation.
Now our hunting traditions can live on.
What had been an unwieldy bureaucratic proposal has now become an acceptable, though not ideal, compromise.
<D>
I, too, would like to welcome the President-in-Office and wish France the very best for its Presidency.
I have two questions.
The first is: has the President-in-Office looked at the idea of an emergency telephone line?
That would be a very good start.
There is an emergency telephone line in a number of countries now.
Could that be extended further to other countries?
Secondly, could he give us more of a timeframe as to when he sees this happening?
This is one of those issues which everybody agrees with and wants to see implemented, but it seems to get bogged down in bureaucracy.
When something does happen, everybody will ask why has it not been done already.
I wonder whether he could give us a timeframe on this issue and also tell us whether the idea of the emergency telephone line has been looked at.
<D>
Energy is one of life's basic necessities.
However, mankind ceased some time ago to be satisfied with merely basic living conditions; we have also been striving to attain the kind of social development which makes our lives easier.
This is why energy follows the economic trends of any given society.
However, we have only recently started looking at the prosperity of the individual from a more holistic perspective and we no longer measure it solely in terms of his or her purchasing power.
Hence, as far as energy is concerned, we need to strike the right balance between the safety and reliability of supplies, environmental protection and action on climate change, and competitiveness.
Our political group promotes all three of these objectives as the cornerstone of the common European energy policy and, in that respect, we welcome the Laperrouze report.
Climate change and the problems we experienced in January with the transmission of Russian gas to Europe testify to the importance of diversity when it comes to the common energy policy.
The European Union must introduce projects that will strengthen our energy infrastructure as soon as possible, in order to facilitate the importation of supplies along different routes.
In this regard, we need to ensure that we are able to import gas both from different transit countries and from different energy exporting countries.
The implementation of the Nabucco project is exceptionally important in this regard.
In addition, we need to enrich our energy mix.
Essentially, it needs to include a higher proportion of energy sources that do not result in greenhouse gas emissions, hence both renewable energy sources and nuclear energy.
We cannot totally turn our backs on coal, either, but we have to ensure that we use the best possible technologies, such as those enabling carbon capture and storage.
I would like to stress that efficient energy use is our priority task.
However, numerous studies have shown that we need to invest our financial, intellectual and creative powers in generation and transmission capacities.
Even with all the measures I have mentioned, we will not be able to reduce import dependency to zero for some time yet.
In order to minimise the problems involved in energy importation, we need to formulate an effective foreign energy policy.
For this reason, I would like the Lisbon Treaty to be adopted, so that any institutional obstacles preventing the formulation of foreign policies can be removed.
I allude here to Ireland, and we expect the Irish people to solve this problem.
However, our expectations of a common foreign energy policy will be more realistic if we take concrete action in the fields that we have already defined as part of the common energy policy.
I am of the opinion that we should adopt the third gas and electricity liberalisation package as soon as this parliamentary term, together with uniform market rules for the entire Union.
In conclusion, let me present my opinion on the amendments tabled.
I think that this Laperrouze report is of sufficient quality as to eliminate the need for any substantial amendments.
The long-term objectives, which we will fulfil through the 20-20-20 package and which have been supported by both the European Council and the European Parliament, should remain unchanged.
Our political group will not support any amendments which seek to reduce the diversification of energy sources.
However, we will support those amendments which seek to increase the number of supply routes and improve energy safety in the Union.
Finally, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent report and thank her for her cooperation.

Vice-President of the Commission. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as a general objective this does not, in my view, relate only to the eastern countries, since the general objective is to encourage a strong, hard-line and ongoing fight against corruption.
The fight against corruption cannot come to an end, for instance, when a country becomes a Member of the European Union.
We have worked with many candidate countries which have become Member States of the European Union.
Those countries have achieved very good results and our interest now is, for instance, in working with those which are not candidates, but are simply our neighbours: the countries of the Western Balkans, important partners such as Ukraine, countries with which we have an important partnership.
I think that it is always in our interest to help those countries to root out corruption and business and politics are always bound up in corruption.
My answer to the question is certainly yes.
The European Union is interested, and I think that it is in our interest, and I would also say in the interest of the people of those countries, because people who suffer politics-related corruption have their rights denied on a daily basis.
That is something we owe to Europe and to the people of those countries.
<D>
author. - (IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, throughout Europe we are seeing across-the-board increases in the price of foodstuffs.
Market surveys carried out show how European consumers are radically changing their eating habits, being forced to change the quality and type of products that they buy as a result of the exorbitant prices.
These increases can be blamed on the one hand on the excessive number of intermediate phases that products must go through from the producer to the consumer, and on the other on the disproportionate increases applied by major supermarket chains.
One thing is certain however: the blame for these increases cannot and must not be placed on our farmers, who are the main victims of this worrying situation.
Mr President and Commissioner, we believe that today more than ever, the European agricultural model must be protected in order to shield national agricultural markets from international price fluctuations and give substance to the defence of models of production and use of the territory which are so characteristic of European agriculture.
We welcome the Council's recent decision to ratify the proposal for zero set-aside for 2008.
However, this does not do enough to reassure us about the worrying situation in terms of cereal stocks and the rising price of cereals on the world market.
We also need to work with the various CMOs and make good use of these mechanisms for rebalancing the market, which would help ease food prices, at least in the internal market.
We asked the Commission, in a recent question, to propose an immediate increase in milk quotas of at least 2-3% to help stabilise the price of this staple product.
In a difficult economic climate such as this one, the European Union and the Member States have a responsibility to help consumers maintain their food purchasing power while at the same time protecting our farmers' right to an income.
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, I should like to thank Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner for that statement.
I think it is very important, following the EU-China summit - and particularly the EU-China human rights dialogue - that there should be an opportunity for Members of this House to examine the outcome.
I do not want to spend time on the EU-China summit.
I want to talk about the human rights dialogue, because that was what took me to Beijing last May when, jointly with Ms Flautre, I was preparing a report on the reform of the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights.
I want this afternoon to speak for those who cannot speak for themselves.
That, of course, is the vast majority of people in China, who want change and reform.
But that movement is led by, among others, Gao Zhisheng, a Christian lawyer who has disappeared from his home in Beijing, where he was being held under house arrest following his conviction for 'subversion' this time last year.
While I know that his name was among those raised in the dialogue, I think that one of the problems that we find in this House is in relation to the dialogue.
While I note that the Commissioner says that it was a sincere and in-depth exchange of views - and I am sure that was true on the side of the Europeans - I am not convinced that would be the case on the side of the Chinese.
In my experience - since the time when I was EU-China rapporteur back in 1997, 10 years ago when this process began - there has been absolutely no product in human rights terms from China in the sense that people's lives have been improved or prisoners have been released or torture has stopped or the massive imprisonment reported by Harry Wu from the Laogai Foundation has ended.
He estimates that there are 6.8 million people in one form of detention or other in China today, many of them there for religious convictions - and we think especially here of the Falun Gong practitioners, who are blameless but who are tortured for their beliefs and, in many cases, are dying.
I would like also to reflect on the imminence of the Olympic Games.
One should not forget that Article 1 of the Olympic Charter states that countries should enjoin 'universal fundamental ethical principles'.
That means only one thing: that China cannot be held to be an appropriate host for these Games, especially since nothing has fundamentally changed since 2001.
I hope all Groups will support the joint motion, which calls for an assessment by the IOC of China's compliance with the terms which were agreed back in 2001.
I fear they will be found wanting.
My view is that the Olympics should be transferred forthwith to Athens and remain there forever.
<D>
in writing. - (EL) The vote in favour of the EU budget for 2009 by the centre right and centre left forces of the European Parliament, with the participation of the Greek MEPs from the New Democracy, PASOK and LAOS parties, signals the intensity of the anti-grassroots policy against the workers.
Within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy and at a time of crisis in the capitalist system, the European Union is using the budget to make workers pay for this latest crisis, to speed up capitalist restructurings, to promote harsh anti-labour measures which undermine collective agreements, to generalise the application of flexible forms of employment and to privatise state social services and insurance systems.
The European Commission and the European Parliament are pushing ahead with the imperialist action of the EU and making more money available for the militarisation of the EU, in order to pave the way for the European monopolies to penetrate third countries.
They are using the political power of the stick and carrot to try and misdirect the labour movement and are strengthening their repressive mechanisms in order to strike at the labour grassroots struggle.
At the same time, they are using social dialogue to try and wheedle the consent of the workers to the rationale of the European way forward.
The parliamentary group of the Communist Party of Greece voted against this deeply class-based budget and the imperialist plans of capital and of the EU.
<D>
in writing. - (DE) Conflict resolution for millions of Uighurs in China - dialogue not condemnation.
We lament the bloody clashes, the dead and wounded in Xinjiang-Uighur.
The actions of the police and security forces were excessive and harm the Chinese Government's goals of growth and stability.
At the same time it is wrong to accuse China of cultural genocide.
The Government is striving to obtain a balance between the autonomy of minority groups and modernisation in a multi-ethnic state.
It is also up to us as a partner to support China's development in terms of democracy and the rule of law, without neglecting the special historical, geographic and cultural aspects of this state.
Biased information will prevent dialogue, and it will not compensate for a policy with an inadequate guarantee of human rights.
China is an important partner for Europe, alongside the US and Russia.
Combating the financial crisis, fighting poverty, stopping climate change, providing energy security and guaranteeing the water supply - none of these things can be achieved without the efforts of the People's Republic of China.
The majority of Uighurs are dismayed over the events of the past week and above all want to live in peace once again.
The Chinese Government knows that this conflict cannot be solved with violence.
We can support the dialogue between the Han Chinese and the Uighurs and other minority groups instead of continuing our decade-long interference from the outside with our inapt methods.
Establishing a structured dialogue aimed at developing the rule of law in China is a more important task for the European Parliament.
<D>
(NL) My name is not Martin Schultz, my name is simply Frank Vanhecke, and I am clearly not a first-rate Member of Parliament and consequently have no right at any time, in any debate, no matter what time or for how long, to express my opinion, and therefore I must now and then turn to the voice of the polls like a mere mortal and not remotely like the holiest of holies, Mr Schultz.
That said, I now want to speak about Mrs Klaß's report.
You see, I do not deny that women in remote areas and in other places undoubtedly experience difficulties now and then, and I am naturally, like all right-minded people, in favour of taking measures to improve the position of people from areas that are discriminated against, including by means of education.
That goes without saying, like kicking down an open door.
The first question that I ask myself: does this come under Europe's jurisdiction?
Is it a task to become embroiled in at European level or is this report the umpteenth example of Europe's obsession with sickness insurance, social insurance and so forth.
I think that the latter is the case.
I think that the subsidiarity of this report in particular has been trampled underfoot.
I think, as we can all see, that Europe is becoming a sort of Big Brother, which honestly frightens me.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, please allow me to clarify that on 5 March I did not attend a NATO Summit.
I might have wanted to but I did not attend the NATO Summit as is mistakenly indicated in the question.
Instead, I took part in the meeting of the Commission - our weekly meeting - and in that meeting we adopted a Commission communication entitled, 'The Western Balkans: enhancing the European perspective'.
Subsequently I made the statement at the press conference on this issue to which the honourable Member is referring.
In that context, in the press conference, I noted that the main issue was consuming much political energy.
I encouraged the leaders of both countries to find a formula which is acceptable to both sides.
I have done this publicly and privately.
In reply to a question I explained that the decisions relating to the EU accession process are taken by Member States on the basis of unanimity.
In this context I expressed my concern that the lack of a solution to the main issue could have a negative effect on the country's accession process.
I can assure you that the Commission will continue to call on the parties to engage constructively to resolve the main issue.
However, the Commission has no competences, no powers on such measures and therefore efforts should continue under the auspices of the United Nations within the framework of the two important UN Executive Council resolutions which date from the year 1993.
<D>
- (FR) Mr President, in Gaza, we have seen war and we have seen death, but we have also seen people, living people, people who have the right to live and whom we have a duty to protect.
Protecting the civilian population - this is the real emergency.
Nothing can excuse the fact that not everything has been done to protect this population, and I would ask you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, do you feel, today, that you have done everything you can to ensure that the Israeli authorities call an immediate halt to this indiscriminate and disproportionate military operation?
The answer is most certainly 'No'.
When rumours of the operation were circulating in the embassies the Council, against Parliament's wishes, reaffirmed its determination to step up its relations.
This was a tragic mistake!
When NGOs call on the Security Council to have the International Criminal Court investigate alleged war crimes, the Council is unable to invoke the 'human rights' clause of its agreement with Israel.
I am sick of hearing that we cannot do better, that we have done all we can.
It is in fact the deadlock of your essentially humanitarian policy to alleviate the damage caused by the military occupation and the war that is the biggest failure.
How far will we have to go in terms of violations of international law before we have the 'human rights' clause applied?
If we are not capable, today, of asking ourselves questions about the scope of effective mechanisms for applying pressure and for implementing, then I do not really know what kind of situation will justify our finally taking action.
I tell you straight: if the business-as-usual approach continues and remains an ongoing part of our relations with Israel, with the 1 000 deaths in Gaza, you will bury Article 11 of the Treaty, you will bury the Union's 'human rights' policy and you will bury the European project!
(Applause)
<D>
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, the International Agency for Research on Cancer recently examined all available evidence on second-hand smoke and cancer.
This was an independent panel of international scientists from 12 countries convened by the World Health Organisation.
They concluded that second-hand smoke is carcinogenic and that exposure to other people's smoke increases the risk of lung cancer in non-smokers by 25-30% - quite a staggering figure.
There is no doubt that people in the workplace and in enclosed public places have the right to be protected from other people's smoke.
Remember that the majority of the population are non-smokers.
The best way to deal with this problem is by a comprehensive smoke-free regulation at Member State level, encompassing a ban in all enclosed public places and in workplaces.
I do not, therefore, agree with Amendment 3 by Mr Florenz asking for limited exceptions.
Any exceptions must be kept to a minimum.
Nor do I agree with his Amendment 2, which deletes a proposal for amending the Framework Directive on workplace safety and health, requiring all employers to ensure a smoke-free workplace.
Employers have a responsibility to protect workers' health.
Further, I would resist any suggestion that exemptions should be granted to pubs or bars not serving food.
Not only is this harmful to employees, but it would also lead to health inequalities.
For example, in the UK, non-food pubs accounted for half of all pubs in deprived areas, compared with a quarter in more affluent areas.
I also think that awareness-raising measures about the dangers of smoking are crucial.
Bigger and bolder picture warnings are part of this awareness-raising and, therefore, I cannot support Amendment 6, which deletes paragraph 16, which refers to these pictures.
I think we would all agree that we must act to help prevent young people from smoking.
The younger people are when they start smoking, the more difficult it is to stop in later life.
Therefore, I would urge support for paragraph 4 of the report, which is aimed at cutting the number of young smokers by 50% by 2025 and rejection of Amendment 1 by Mr Florenz calling for the deletion of this paragraph.
Smoking causes enormous health problems within the population, both of smokers and non-smokers, and I know that some colleagues feel that the use of snus is a better alternative.
However, I cannot support measures that may lead to the wider use of snus, because its use has its own health-related problems, including oral cancer.
There is no value in trading one health hazard for another.
Finally, if we are serious about improving the health of our citizens, then we must encourage all Member States to introduce the necessary measures to make a smoke-free Europe a reality.
Can I just suggest that we could make a great start by enforcing the ban here in our own Parliament buildings?
<D>
Mr President, I welcome this debate and report on social reality and, though we must of course welcome stocktaking and exchanges of best practice and the open method of coordination, the reality that we have to understand is that these devices have not yet stopped: women having 24 % less pay compared to men in Germany; nearly one in three children living in poverty in Poland; and wealth inequality in my own country, the United Kingdom, at a 40-year high.
I do think that European social funding and national programmes like the New Deal in the UK are essential active labour market measures to tackle the real barriers which prevent groups in our society from progressing from worklessness to work and that work is still one of the best devices for us to combat poverty.
I do thank Commissioner Špidla for putting a firm commitment in the Commission's work programme for new legislation on Article 13 discrimination, which I have long discussed with him.
I and this Parliament look forward to working with him on the detail, not least in the Presidency conference next week.
But all of us - he and us together - must guard against this talk on stocktaking delaying the new social agenda in Europe, or deregulation in one area actually leading to increases in inequality and injustice, not combating these evils.
Trade unionists, social NGOs and of course disabled people, with whom I have worked for more than 20 years, are sceptical about what we are doing for social Europe.
We have to listen to their concerns and we have to respond to them.
<D>
The final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday, 10 January 2008, pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure, has been distributed.
The following amendments have been proposed:
Monday:
No amendments.
Tuesday:
The PPE-DE Group has proposed that the two Demetriou and Cashman reports on the control of persons at the EU's external borders be postponed to a subsequent sitting.
<D>
Madam President, this year we mark the 75th anniversary of the famine in Ukraine in 1932-1933.
The famine was not a natural disaster, but the result of Joseph Stalin's genocidal plan by which, having dealt with the Ukrainian intelligentsia, he aimed to destroy the rural population of Ukraine.
Some 10 million men, women and children died as a result of this genocide.
It was a purposeful and systematic extermination carried out by the authorities of the Soviet Union.
The criminal intentions of the communists were clear.
While Ukrainians were starving to death, the Soviets exported millions of tonnes of grain, and sealed the borders of Ukraine to prevent the devastated population from entering Russia.
They turned down offers of international humanitarian aid, claiming that the famine did not exist.
In the present Russian Federation, there is hypocrisy over the history of communist crimes, and Stalin is presented as an effective manager.
Some Western countries kept quiet during this huge tragedy for the Ukrainian people, as they were in the process of establishing diplomatic ties with the Soviet Union, which they wanted to make dependent on economic cooperation.
Today we cannot keep quiet, and it is our duty to honour the memory of the victims of the Holodomor.
<D>
Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate both rapporteurs.
Mr Guellec's report highlights the fact that, while there is economic convergence occurring between Member States, there is also a widening of regional and local disparities.
That situation goes to the very heart of cohesion policy and clearly indicates the need to include a significant territorial dimension in all policies, but particularly in the Lisbon Strategy.
I have seen this situation occurring in my own country, Ireland, where convergence with the EU average has been achieved - indeed surpassed - but where the economic gap between different regions is widening.
It is extremely important that this gap does not continue to widen, and one of the ways of ensuring this is to increase investment in innovation, research and development in those regions that are lagging behind.
I want to thank Mr Guellec for including my suggestion on the importance of social capital in boosting regional economic growth.
We are all aware of the role played by physical capital, natural capital and human capital as the basis for economic growth and development.
However, social capital, which is the latent resource residing within and among cooperating groups, provides the added value.
Data from the UN Handbook, which relates to a very significant number of countries, indicates that the contribution of social capital to economic growth is in the order of 5% of GDP.
Finally, in response to the comment by Mr Clark, who suggests we should have 'trade not aid', I would say that in the EU we manage both - trade via the single market and targeted aid where needed.
That is the best of both worlds.
<D>
(DE) Madam President, I am sure you will allow me five minutes.
(The President interrupted the speaker)
Firstly, Mrs Merkel asked whether the law complied with European regulations in all respects and Mr Orbán agreed to change the provisions of the law if necessary, following the assessment by the Commission.
I think that this is an approach which is correct, honest, open and fair to everyone involved.
My second point concerns the state media law in North Rhine-Westphalia.
Radio programmes are not allowed to present only one opinion or to cover only one party, group, lobby, religious denomination or philosophy under the terms of paragraph 31.
(Heckling)
The law also states that the head of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia can give instructions to the state media authority and can impose fines of up to EUR 500 000.
<D>
(SV) The last year has shown that the EU can take important decisions in difficult situations.
Unfortunately, the last few days have been a disappointment.
When the EU needs clear and stringent budget rules, France and Germany hesitate.
This causes us concern.
Our message is: leave Mr Rehn's proposal alone!
I would like to thank unreservedly Mrs Berès and my colleagues in the Special Committee on Financial, Economic and Social Crisis, who have shown that we in the European Parliament can reach across the party boundaries and find common solutions in the interests of Europe.
The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has proposed an amendment to the effect that if a financial transaction tax is introduced, it must, of necessity, be done on a global scale.
It is important in this case that it is done at a global level.
Nationalism must not be allowed to gain a foothold in Europe again.
It is a market economy with clear boundaries and free trade that creates prosperity.
We need a more unified Europe, a more open Europe, a stronger Europe - we quite simply need more Europe.
The proposed penalty options will initially apply only to the countries of the euro area.
In this regard, we would like to see a wording that includes all 27 Member States.
I would therefore like to present an oral amendment to the Feio report which I hope that Parliament will be able to support.
The rapporteur and the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament have stated that they are willing to do so.
I will read the text in English:
As far as possible, all 27 Member States should apply to the maximum all the economic governance proposals, recognising that for Member States outside the euro area, this would be done on a voluntary basis.
(SV) Today is not the time to create an EU that is in danger of tearing the Union apart.
<D>
The European Commission's Green Paper presents convincing arguments as to why we need to improve current pension systems.
However, we must not forget that most of the solutions proposed are socially sensitive.
We must therefore evaluate carefully not only the benefits of these solutions, but also the potential risks, particularly when we are talking about increasing the retirement age or Member States losing influence in pension policy.
Although the Commission considers raising the retirement age to be one of the less painful ways of adapting to increasing life expectancy, it does not provide specific proposals on the employment of elderly people in the labour market.
With the possibility of delaying retirement, many unemployed people under the pensionable age may land in the poverty trap.
Insufficient consideration has also been given to how much people's health will allow them to work longer.
Furthermore, we must take into account the fact that women take lower paid or part-time work more often than men and that due to childbirth and motherhood, and caring for children and disabled family members, they lose insurance guarantees and ultimately receive smaller pensions.
I feel that we must also focus more on other means of improving pension systems, such as timing the start of working life, better reconciliation of work and family life, a 'flexible' assessment of retirement age, the introduction of minimum standards for pensions, etc.
In any case, I would view the Green Paper as a serious step towards ensuring normal living conditions for current and future pensioners.
<D>
in writing. - (RO) Over the next 50 years, climate change will have a significant impact on important economic sectors such as agriculture, energy, transport, ecosystems, tourism and health.
Climate change will also affect households, companies and certain sections of society, especially the elderly, people with disabilities and low income families.
The EU is determined to take prompt action to cut greenhouse gas emissions.
However, it is not enough to cut greenhouse gas emissions to alleviate the impact of climate change.
Additional action is required to alleviate this problem in the short term.
The effects of climate change are expected to be more significant than was envisaged and they will appear, regardless of the measures implemented to alleviate them.
Consequently, measures are required to strengthen the resistance of natural and human systems in standing up to the impact of climate change, in other words, adaptation policies.
These policies are being applied in the EU, but policies are also required at a global level.
This is why the Copenhagen conference must be an international success.
We need to have a global solidarity pact for developing green economies by promoting certain clean technologies which will guarantee jobs, as well as protect the environment and the population's health.
<D>
The Energy Efficiency Action Plan is a cost-effective means of increasing the competitiveness of the economy and security of energy supply to the European Union.
The plan to begin improving energy efficiency is also a perfect opportunity for the development of small and medium-sized enterprises.
The Bendtsen report rightly draws attention to ways of using energy effectively and efficiently without the need to reduce its consumption, because this is continuing to rise in the Member States.
The use of new energy technologies in construction and transport allows significant savings at the level of the whole Union.
However, for such methods to come into use, an information campaign for the citizens is needed, as also is a reduction in the costs of energy-saving technologies.
It is, indeed, the high price of innovative equipment which is the greatest obstacle to its coming into use.
Adoption of binding targets for 2020 is difficult for many Member States.
We must, however, remember that each of the Member States is at a different stage of development of energy policy.
A binding renewable energy target of 20% of final energy consumption by 2020 may prove to be too great a challenge, particularly for the 12 new Member States.
<D>
President-in-Office of the Council. - I think it is in the conclusions of the Environment Council in early March.
I do not have the papers with me so I will look carefully again.
My feeling is that I have read this.
We are ahead of the European Spring Council meeting and I would expect confirmation of all those ambitious goals.
I do not know - and this raises some other questions - whether we will come up with an appropriate amount of money to put on the table for funds to help the developing countries with mitigation and adaptation, because we are just at the beginning of our talks with the US and other partners and it would not make sense to show our cards right now.
The debate with the Americans is ongoing.
The Deputy Minister of the environment met Carol Browner early this month and Martin Bursík, who is the Czech Minister for the Environment, is going to meet his partners in Washington - I think later this week or early next month - so there is already a dialogue.
Yes, of course, we need to find common ground.
There is the economic crisis; there are those ambitious environmental goals.
You are right that we can find a lot of synergies and there is no need to fight.
If you read the European economic recovery plans, there are a lot of programmes which have a green cover or a green colour.
At the same time, a lot of public explanation lies ahead.
The conditions in the Member States of the EU are not necessarily always the same so I expect a lot of public work and public diplomacy lies ahead of us in this area.
Subject: Road safety
According to the priorities of the Czech Presidency, the high number of people killed on European roads requires an enhancement of Europe-wide effort to improve road safety.
What plans does the Presidency have to tackle this issue?
<D>
Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, I am grateful for all the remarks, which reflect very clearly the controversial nature of this topic.
As Ms Gräßle mentioned, this proposal started in 2004, when times were completely different.
I like the expression 'there is a conflict of interests'.
There is a clear institutional conflict of interests between independence and accountability.
We must continue to work and have this debate.
Whatever will happen cannot happen without collaboration between Parliament, the Council and the Commission on how to solve this conflict of interests.
As I have said, there are not many, but some, possibilities.
Most of you clearly support the idea of greater independence, which also means greater accountability.
Let us find out what is possible.
There are certain clear limits within the Commission.
It is very clear that the directorate general cannot go independently to the courts: it is not possible within the legal framework.
A very important point mentioned by many of you was the right to go to the Member States.
Again, it is the Commission that takes action in the Member States, and there are clear limits to the extent of involvement by the Commission which is acceptable to Member States.
The Commission is accountable here and to the public for OLAF's activities, so we would be very happy to have a more independent OLAF, which could go independently to the courts and be independently accountable, with a separate discharge.
We would welcome all these things and also very clear supervision both of the investigations and of the content of those investigations.
At present we do not have a public prosecutor.
This is what we await, but while we are waiting we must find some other solutions.
Let us continue this work.
As I said, we will formulate a concept paper on the basis of this discussion.
I am looking forward to fruitful debates with the honourable Members and the rapporteurs on this issue.
<D>
(PT) Jimmy Carter said in an interview this week that since President Clinton there have never been any good-faith talks on the subject of the Middle East under the patronage of the United States of America.
Expectations are therefore running high for the international conference in November.
It is expected that there will be some tangible development so that we can actually envisage a time-scale for resolution of the human drama and conflict.
The humanitarian situation in Gaza is currently deteriorating.
Although a few months ago we had a real open prison which constantly closing in, that is becoming ever more apparent when every day we count the dead, the hunger, the fear, the power of weapons and their effect, on both sides of the walls, on civilians' lives.
Humanitarian assistance is urgently required in the light of the Geneva Conventions and it is imperative that Israel should allow that assistance to be administered.
The movement of persons and goods must become a reality, unless we are to see a real human tragedy in that coastal strip.
The major objectives which we should be launching at the next international conference are to put an end to the violence and to seek a solution based on the existing resolutions which will allow Palestinians and Israelis to live together in peace, before it is too late.
<D>
(PT) I congratulate Mr Van Hecke on this important report.
To improve the effectiveness of European aid it is essential to invest in human and financial capacity and to overcome the inconsistencies between policies and the institutional architecture.
The Lisbon Treaty opens up an opportunity by creating the European External Action Service.
Besides supporting the future High Representative, this service must be equipped to carry EU development policy forward in parallel to CFSP and ESDP.
It is not necessary to reinvent the wheel to guarantee aid effectiveness.
It is dependent on fulfilling promises already made.
As Commissioner Michel has stressed, the Member States must increase public development aid to the levels promised in 2005 without inflating them by writing off debts, and must effectively direct it towards attaining the Millennium Development Goals, particularly in an era in which rising oil and food prices make combating poverty in the world an even more urgent matter.
Mr President, what is at stake is the credibility of the European Union and its effectiveness as a global player, rather than the effectiveness of aid.
<D>
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (PL) Mr President, the Report on Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment in Development Cooperation deals with problems affecting women in African and Asian countries, for example.
It sets out a strategy involving measures in various categories: gender equality, the political system, employment, education, health, and violence against women.
As we know, equal rights for women and men are a major aspect of social development enshrined in our European civilisation in basic regulations on respect for human rights and all people.
But equal rights and non-discrimination against women are not the only condition for social development.
There are a whole series of factors that are important for social progress, starting with compliance with ethical and moral principles that guarantee a signification reduction in exploitation, violence, cheating and other forms of manipulation, including discrimination against and oppression of women.
The dramatic living conditions of women in the African countries are the result of a policy of pillaging natural resources and of speculation by international companies that enrich themselves at the cost of the life and health of the local population.
Budget support and other EU programmes will not compensate for the losses inflicted by a robber economy.
Ethical relativism, too, favours sexual exploitation and the spread of sexually-transmitted diseases.
Sexual freedom as propagated robs women of their dignity by reducing them to sex objects and encourages violence.
The situation of women will be improved not by more funding for contraception and abortion, but by financial support for families, especially those with many children, so as to make education and development possible and to improve health care and social protection, especially for pregnant women.
Educated women with a predisposition for leadership or a desire to engage in politics should of course be able to stand for election and use their psycho-physical difference to broaden the spectrum of views on matters of importance not only for women and children.
However, gender mainstreaming as a central idea - which has brought us paternity leave, among other things - has already had the results that might have been expected, since Swedish fathers are not alone in preferring elk hunting or reading the newspaper to looking after children.
The tyranny of sexual aggression spread by the mass media influences ...

in writing. - The attacks of 11 September 2001 have utterly changed the world.
The terrorist attacks of that day have not only altered how Americans see and understand the world but have also offered democratic societies all over the world a new perspective on this modern world, in which terrorist threats of attacks such as those that devastated Madrid (March 2004) and London (July 2005) pose a frequent and daunting challenge.
Now terrorists are using modern means of communication, such as the internet, to push for training, recruiting, and planning attacks.
The use of this technology presents a unique threat to the Union, and we should all work together to combat terrorism with all the means that are at our disposal.
However, in order for our democratic society to effectively counter these threats, the fight against terrorism must be accompanied by a strengthening of our fundamental rights and freedoms.
To address the threat of terrorism, it is necessary to have common provisions in the EU, and existing legislation should be amended accordingly.
Modern terrorism has a new way of operating, but it must be fought by the EU with the same strength and determination demonstrated in fighting traditional terrorism.
<D>
In view of the consequences in the Gulf of Mexico, I think that the resolution adopted by Parliament today on the EU's actions in the exploration and extraction of oil in Europe is extremely important.
As a Member of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, I must point out that the production of deep sea oil and gas is important to security of supply in the EU.
Deep sea oil and gas production does not take place under such extreme conditions as in the Gulf of Mexico.
However, every precaution must be taken.
This is why we must work on prevention so that we have up-to-date legislation that is effectively applied and prevents natural disasters from occurring.
However, we cannot get around the fact that this type of extraction and production always carries risks.
Therefore, we must also think about building up a genuine capacity to respond to possible accidents such as the one that occurred in the Gulf of Mexico.
This resolution is a step in the right direction as it encourages progress in the EU in terms of both prevention and response.

President-in-Office of the Council. - Madam President, I am grateful for this opportunity to take stock of the latest developments in Kosovo.
In two weeks' time - on 17 February 2009 - Kosovo will celebrate the first anniversary of its declaration of independence, and this debate is certainly timely.
Since then, Kosovo has adopted a constitution and a completely new legal and institutional framework.
The declaration of independence created a new situation and new challenges for the international community and for the EU in particular.
The differing views of the Member States in reaction to the declaration of independence in no way undermine the Union's overall policy objectives.
We remain committed to assisting in the economic and political development of Kosovo within the overall objective of ensuring long-term stability for the Balkans as a whole.
In the case of Kosovo, that means contributing in particular to strengthening of the rule of law, respect for human rights and the protection of minorities, as well as encouraging economic development and working for the protection of Kosovo's rich cultural and religious heritage.
It also means continuing to see Kosovo within the wider framework set for the Western Balkans at the Thessaloniki Summit in 2003.
The policy of supporting a European perspective for all the Western Balkan countries, agreed on that occasion, has since been reaffirmed, most recently by the Council at its meeting of 8 December 2008.
Proof of our continued commitment lies in the rapid appointment early last year of Pieter Feith as EU Special Representative, who is based in Priština, and you will have a chance to meet him in the Committee on Foreign Affairs very soon.
His task, and that of his team, is to provide valuable support on the ground in order to help us collectively meet all our political objectives.
More recently, EULEX, the most ambitious civilian ESDP mission to date, began its mandate in early December 2008.
Its main aim is to assist and support the Kosovo authorities in the area of the rule of law, specifically in developing the police, judiciary and customs administration.
Our main challenge over the coming months will be to intensify our engagement in Kosovo, most importantly by moving to full deployment of EULEX.
We are realistic enough to know that 2009 will present its fair share of difficulties and obstacles.
Kosovo institutions will also face many challenges in the implementation of their commitments to develop a stable multi-ethnic and democratic Kosovo.
The international community's assistance is crucial if Kosovo is to succeed in integrating fully with the rest of the region.
The Commission has announced that later this year it will present a study examining ways of furthering Kosovo's political and socio-economic development.
This has been welcomed by the Council.
It should offer new opportunities and build on what has already been achieved, adjusted in the light of our experience over the next few months.
The situation in the north of Kosovo will certainly continue to be difficult over the months to come, and will require particular attention.
The most recent outbreaks of ethnic violence in Mitrovica in early January this year were potentially serious but were contained.
It is particularly encouraging that the authorities in Priština acted with reasonable restraint.
However, these incidents are a constant reminder of the constant risk of destabilisation there.
We will continue to monitor closely the situation in the north of the country in particular.
The Presidency is grateful for the continuing interest of Members of Parliament and for your support for the role of the Union in the region.
I particularly welcome the proposed resolution which has been tabled at this part-session.
It is encouraging that Parliament is able to give its broad support to our efforts in the region, and to the Union's commitment to the stability of Kosovo within the wider region.
This Presidency is committed to keeping you informed, both through regular discussions here in the plenary, as well as more detailed briefings through the committees.
We are planning various activities this spring, inter alia to dedicate the Gymnich meeting in late March to the Western Balkans.
I also know that Pieter Feith will be meeting with the AFET Committee next week, and he will be able to provide a comprehensive update on the latest developments on the ground.
<D>
Madam President, I would first of all like to add my thanks to our rapporteur for all his hard work on this delicate subject.
However, despite his great efforts, I am afraid that I and my national delegation cannot support this report.
I believe that the CAP is in need of radical reform.
It needs to move away from the old direct subsidy route to a system that is market orientated and that values rural sustainability and the environment, and recognises efficient farming instead of propping up inefficient farming.
Whilst this report in itself is not a major reform document, it does set the tone for future reforms beyond 2013.
That is why I am disappointed in the outcome of the vote in the Agriculture Committee, which yet again - it appears to me - has resulted in that committee turning its back on a fundamental reform of this discredited system.
In particular, I highlight compulsory modulation.
I cannot support a position that will see less money going to rural development and furthermore removes the need for Member States to cofinance new modulation money.
I also cannot support the Committee view that we should also step back from full decoupling, but I reserve my biggest fear for the Commission.
Your position, Commissioner, on compulsory modulation is right.
Your position on decoupling is right.
For once, we have a Commission that seriously wants to reform the CAP, but faces a Parliament that always fails to deliver on this issue and believes that the challenges we face could be solved by sticking to the old discredited system.
Hang tough, Commissioner, you are right and, sadly, I suspect this Chamber will be wrong.
<D>
President of the Commission. - First of all, I think it is fair to welcome the fact that we are going to have a Commissioner for Climate Action.
So far, that position has not existed.
It is precisely because there is a lot to do and I want to give weight, to use your expression, to this function that I have decided and have announced to Parliament the creation of the post of Commissioner for Climate Action.
That Commissioner will have a lot of responsibilities.
He or she will have to mainstream climate action, because climate action has to do with energy but also with the environment, research, agriculture and industry.
So this is a very important coordinating role for climate action, both internally and externally.
It is quite evident that Copenhagen will not be the end of the process.
I hope we will have an operational agreement at Copenhagen, but there will also be a lot of things to do after Copenhagen, including the work with our main partners.
The Commissioner for Climate Action will therefore have a very important role, externally and internally, to fulfil all our expectations for a strong climate policy in the European Union.
<D>
rapporteur. - Mr President, I hope that if Parliament adopts the electricity report tomorrow, it will be an indication to energy companies all over Europe that we want the consumer back in the driving seat.
Before talking about the most controversial aspect of this directive, I would like to dwell on some of the areas where we have managed to find a consensus within Parliament so far.
There cannot be anyone within the European Union who has not noticed the massive increase in energy prices in recent months.
All over the European Union there are people struggling to pay their energy bills so we believe that the issue of 'energy poverty' should be placed firmly on the EU agenda.
After all, the ETS system and the renewables targets are European and they impact on energy prices.
We have respected subsidiarity, Commissioner, in our request that Member States should come up with their own definitions of energy poverty and an action plan for dealing with the problem.
So, if the Council want a deal on this package, they need to understand that this is a central requirement of Parliament.
Already many rights for consumers exist in the energy field but they are not enforced.
So we have asked the national regulatory authorities to use incentives and sanctions to ensure the consumer is protected.
We have also listed additional rights which should be enjoyed by the consumer such as affordable prices for low-income families, an easier way to switch suppliers, increased representation for the consumer, especially when they have complaints, and a fair deal for people in rural and remote areas.
We believe there should be a roll-out of smart meters within 10 years, which should boost energy efficiency, and companies should be creative in the way they charge for energy and not reward people who use more as is currently the case.
Priority access should be given to renewables to enter the grid so that we can reach that 20% target.
We have got to understand that when we talk about transmission systems we are talking about monopolies, so clearly there is a need for very strict regulation.
We would like to see much better cooperation between national regulatory authorities and competition authorities.
In this way, we might get to a point where we do not have almost half of the countries in the EU where one company dominates over 70% of the market.
Now to the most controversial part of the report - the issue of unbundling.
The clear thing is that the current system has not worked.
There is a suspicion that some are not playing fair.
They are giving priority access to their own company; they put obstacles in place which could stifle competition.
That is why I believe, as rapporteur, that total separation of energy supply from transmission companies or full ownership unbundling - as was suggested initially by the Commission - should be the only option for electricity companies.
It is only in this way you will remove the conflict of interest.
You can build as many Chinese walls as you want, but there will be no incentive for companies to encourage competition in the market if they also own transmission companies.
We need a level playing field: we need easier access for renewables and SMEs, but, probably more than anything else, we need a stable regulatory framework for the one trillion-worth of investment that is necessary in the EU market.
If we fudge this issue now, we will not be giving a clear signal to those investors and the lights could go off in Europe.
This issue will not go away and, if the lights go out, governments can fall.
So, who is resisting this?
Germany, France, Austria, Luxembourg, Greece and Bulgaria: they think that strengthening these Chinese walls will be enough.
Some suspect also that there is an effort to protect national champions who are happy to invest in other markets but are reluctant to allow others into their markets.
We should not oversell the model however, we are not likely to see a reduction in prices under any model.
We know that the Council has come to an informal agreement on this issue.
They have suggested the strengthening of these Chinese walls.
Many of us, however, feel that this will not be enough for European consumers and have suggested sticking to a tough position.
I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs in particular and everybody involved in this package for the cooperation on this very complex dossier.
<D>
Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking the shadow rapporteurs who have contributed to the adoption of this report in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, not least Mrs Pietikäinen and Mrs Raeva, and to congratulate the coordinators from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, Mr Gauzès and Mr Klinz, who played an important role in terms of ensuring that this report, which will be put to the vote tomorrow in our plenary session, was adopted in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
You know that at the conclusion of the G20 meeting, some of the EU Heads of State - and prominent ones at that - claimed victory by announcing, in a stream of communications, that the age of banking secrecy was over.
These thunderous statements aside, the European Parliament - and I welcome this - has now set out to do the practical work and has taken an interest not in communication but in the efforts it can make to effectively combat tax evasion, which is estimated to amount to EUR 200 billion each year.
These EUR 200 billion should be compared with the amounts for the recovery plans to help the countries of Europe cope with the crisis; they should be compared with the European Union budget; and they should also be compared with the deficit levels of the countries of Europe.
Today, Europe's taxpayers are thus perfectly justified in asking the European banking sector, and therefore the European banks, to make the efforts needed to allow the Member States' tax authorities to recover part of the tax income they are losing through evasion or fraud.
We have done a constructive job, and I believe that we avoided resorting to dictates or mutual recrimination.
We have advanced on three fronts, and I wish to commend what was the draft text from the European Commission and the work done around Commissioner Kovács, who was unquestionably going in the right direction.
We have tried, as best we could, taking as our yardstick what the European taxpayers are telling us, to improve the Commission's text in three directions.
We decided that, as regards the scope of the directive, the text was a little too timid, both on the legal structures involved and in the definition of savings products.
We know that financial engineering has a considerable imagination when it comes to inventing new financial products to allow some people to escape taxation.
This is why Parliament and the Commission propose to introduce a committee procedure that adapts the definition of savings products to the current reality of that financial engineering.
However, on this issue, many products are currently excluded from the scope, and, in our opinion, they should be included as quickly as possible; this is particularly the case for some types of pension schemes that work via capitalisation, and, more generally, we think that the proposal to include products which guarantee 95% of the investment does not offer sufficient guarantees.
That is why we think the threshold of 90% is more reasonable.
Amendments will be tabled to this end tomorrow in plenary.
We will see if they are adopted.
I regret that we have not found a compromise in committee on this point and hope that plenary gives a strong signal by defining savings products as products which guarantee 90% of the capital and not just 95% products, as the Commission is proposing.
Broad consensus was, however, reached on how the scope of the directive should be widened, especially in the wording of Annexes I and III.
Annex I is, moreover, considerably strengthened by the report, since we are drawing up a very broad list of tax havens that spares no jurisdiction and that, unlike the G20 list, specifically includes Delaware and Nevada.
We have defined more broadly than the Commission the legal constructions that these jurisdictions will have to show either do not exist on their territory or are fiscally transparent, and I believe that this reversal of the burden of proof is a more effective way of fighting tax evasion.
However, the main weakness of this text - and I will conclude on this - relates to the transition period granted to three Member States: Belgium, Austria and Luxembourg.
Although Belgium has announced it is abandoning the system of withholding tax, I wish to see the system for the automatic exchange of information become widespread and, for this to happen, I would like a date to be set for the end of the transition period.
This is why, even though we have adopted the principle of a study to assess the respective merits of the systems of withholding tax and exchange of information for 2011, when the directive is revised, we wish to see 2014 set as the end date for this transition period.
I wish to say that we have tried to work in a spirit of transparency and towards improved transparency at a time when European taxpayers are required to contribute, especially in order to come to the aid of the European banking sector.
<D>
(FR) Mr President, here we have a prime example of the way in which the human rights issue is being used by the European Union for its own ends!
We refuse to clearly condemn the United States for the criminal attitude it is displaying at Guantánamo.
We refuse to acknowledge the responsibility of Member States of the European Union for allowing incarceration and torture in the secret prisons of the CIA.
We refuse to talk about the minors incarcerated and tortured by the United States at Guantánamo despite their being recognised by UNICEF as child soldiers who have been arrested, whereas we would not hesitate to denounce appalling dictatorships and vote for sanctions in other countries.
When it comes to ourselves and to the United States, human rights appear to be less of a problem.
We, for our part, ask for universality of human rights.
We also ask that our attitude be guided solely by the desire to serve the people and, in that context, want the United States to be tried for human rights violations, as well as the Member States of the European Union found guilty of complicity.
International law must be complied with at all times, and torture and killings in the name of the war against terrorism must be stopped.
Last but not least - it is worth repeating - the base at Guantánamo must be closed, and Cuba must regain control of its entire territory.
<D>
Before I hand over to Commissioner Grybauskaitė, I should like to express my amazement that other Commissioners, whom we have asked to be here, are not present.
There are various reasons: ostensibly our invitations have gone out somewhat too late.
This may be the case and I shall check.
I should like to remind the Commission, however, that by Interinstitutional Agreement it has to be present during the week the European Parliament is in session.
I shall check the matter and I expect that both the Commission and we as Parliament, of course, will honour our commitments under the interinstitutional agreement.
I would therefore ask the Commissioner present, Commissioner Grybauskaitė, to convey this to the Commission.
I have already said as much, incidentally, at the Conference of Presidents.
I do not wish, however, to make any one-sided accusations here, but I shall be checking the matter.
<D>
The programme to protect children using the Internet and new technologies is one of the basic forms of protecting children, both in terms of dissemination of technology and of increased familiarity with the use of computers.
The result is that children are currently at risk because of illegal content, and inappropriate behaviour such as child pornography, harassment, grooming, and seduction through the Internet.
According to the statistics, more than 70% of young people aged between 12 and 15 use the Internet for approximately three hours each day.
Sadly, most of these young people have viewed images of a pornographic nature.
The growing number of Internet sites containing pornography, and the ever lower average age of children falling prey to this process is also cause for alarm.
A multi-pronged approach is the only way to increase child safety in the context of the Internet.
This broadly based programme must involve children, their families, schools, communications operators, suppliers of Internet services and other institutions.
An important role in combating harmful behaviour on the Internet should be played by hotlines serving to gather information on illegal content.
Children should be taught how to avoid dangerous behaviour on the Internet.
For their part, parents and teachers should participate in learning campaigns on computer use, so as to reduce the generation gap in the area of new technologies and ensure that dangers can be combated more effectively.
<D>
Mr President, in the case of online gambling, there must be clear and unambiguous laws that serve to limit, control and account for the nearly EUR 3 billion in annual gross revenue realised by the gambling industry.
However, according to Mrs Schaldemose, that EUR 3 billion is only 5% of the total gambling market in the European Union.
Therefore, the importance and influence of this industry is obvious - as are its dangers.
Gambling is often correctly associated with crime at international level, and cross-border gambling rings which are much easier to run via the Internet jeopardise the laws of various nations and harbour risks to national sovereignty.
It is also important to note the negative effects on health associated with gambling.
As a medical doctor, I am well aware of the damaging characteristics of obsessive or addictive gambling.
These are not issues that the European Parliament can underestimate.
When it comes to tackling fraud, criminal behaviour and financial and medical issues that correspond to online gambling, I call on the European Parliament to vote repeatedly on better and better solutions in future.
<D>
The definition of trans-European transport networks is a fundamental step towards improving transport connections for residential and industrial areas across Europe.
While in the North, West and South of Europe, railways and roads terminate at sea ports, roads and railways in the East have the enormous potential to continue eastwards across the whole of Asia to the shores of the Pacific.
Asian countries such as China, Japan and India are experiencing significant economic growth and are becoming major trading partners for European companies.
It is therefore necessary, along with the construction of an internal European transport structure, to also open up transport routes to the East.
The broad-gauge railway line from Vladivostok reaches the border of the EU at Čierna nad Tisou.
A project has been drawn up for this line to be continued to Vienna, linking it to the Danube, to the ports and, of course, to the European network.
In my opinion, projects such as this should also receive very significant support in the future.
Thank you.
<D>
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, of course it is always better when the Commissioner is present, as there are some critical points that I would like to put to him directly, but I will have to do this at a later time.
For more than 15 years we have been trying, or rather the Commission has been trying, to lay down a regulatory framework in the form of an EU directive on airport charges.
Two attempts have already failed because of the conflict of interest between the airports and the airlines and between the different Member States.
On this occasion, too, there was a great deal of conflict and I cannot recall a single one of the 189 amendments in committee that was generally accepted by all the parties involved.
Many airlines want to see as much cost transparency as possible from the other side, the airports, and a regulatory authority that would ultimately set the prices, along with the introduction of the 'single till' system.
Many airports would prefer no change whatsoever to the status quo.
Moreover, the negotiations were also hampered by the structural particularities that exist in various Member States.
The United Kingdom, for example, already has a rigorous regulatory authority, the CAA, while at the same time most of the airports want to be deregulated and indeed the trend is in that direction.
In Sweden, Portugal, Greece, Finland and Spain many of the airports are operated in a system of airport networks with standard airport charges, which means cross-subsidisation and often results in little transparency.
In Spain airport charges are even laid down by Parliament, in other words the Members of Parliament decide on the levels that will apply.
In Germany this area has been controlled at federal level and not by a national authority, while in the new Member States airport charges are needed to a large extent to develop the airport infrastructure.
I mention all these different interests if only to demonstrate how complicated these negotiations have been.
What we have achieved to date has therefore been primarily directed at settling these conflicts of interest, for we in the committee are of the opinion that such a regulation is needed and that every effort should be made to agree on one.
So what has been achieved so far towards settling these differences?
We have reduced the field of application to airports with either five million passenger journeys or more a year or 15% of the national passenger throughput in the Member State concerned, for in the case of regional airports with less than five million passengers a year the risk of an abuse of market power is either small or absent.
Secondly, we have stipulated that airports will be free to choose their preferred business model, and thirdly, we have included airport networks generally within the scope of the directive.
Fourthly, we have firmed up the role of the regulatory authorities and allowed them to delegate all or part of the provisions to regional regulatory bodies.
Fifthly, we have introduced stricter requirements for the intervention of the regulatory authority and, sixthly, we have again allowed airport managing bodies to pre-finance infrastructure projects via their airport charges, as had been possible in the past, though subject to certain conditions.
We want to see differentiation of charges based on objective criteria and according to the level of services provided and the environmental performance, and we want to see a system for defining and concluding an overall service level agreement.
The compromises that have been negotiated were adopted by the Committee on Transport and Tourism with only one dissenting vote.
That is a real achievement, considering the starting position, and on this point I would like to express my thanks to all the shadow rapporteurs for their close and constructive collaboration.
We now have to lay down standardised principles of transparency, non-discrimination and regulated consultation and notification when setting airport charges in Europe.
This will help reduce future distortions of competition and make it more difficult for those who might seek to abuse their market power.
The directive will, in my opinion, make a significant contribution towards stabilising the inherent partnership that exists between airports and airlines and at the same time will strengthen Europe's position as an air transport hub.
I therefore call on Members to support the Committee on Transport and Tourism in tomorrow's vote on the directive at first reading.
<D>
Allow me to congratulate my colleague, Mrs Petre, for this excellent report.
There are a few points which we need to bear in mind when we are talking about European product quality:
1.
Implementation of 'qualified market access' offers a solution for guaranteeing that the products available to European consumers, whether produced domestically or imported, meet the same standards.
2.
The costs incurred by European producers in guaranteeing food safety and demands linked to cross-compliance, which should be covered by CAP funds.
3.
The promotion of specifically European agricultural and food products.
As I also requested in the report on the amendment of Regulation No 3/2008, the European Union's cofinancing rate must be increased.
At the same time, however, we need to simplify the administrative procedures for the system of Traditional Speciality Guaranteed and offer better protection for products with a geographical indication or designation of origin.
I hope that the recommendations we are going to adopt will be implemented as soon as possible by the European Commission and Member States because we cannot afford to waste time in such circumstances when European citizens are being hit by the effects of an extremely serious economic recession.
<D>
A good agricultural policy is one which is based on what the consumer needs, and not on what the producer wants.
Only 5% of EU inhabitants, including in Slovakia, are employed in agriculture, but we are all - 100% of us - consumers of agricultural products.
What the consumer cares about is quality and price.
This applies not only to cars and televisions, but also to bread, vegetables, meat and milk.
However, the common agricultural policy turns the whole issue completely on its head, because it is based on what farmers need.
The submitted report, in the spirit of the former approach of the EU, pays too much attention to effects and ignores causes.
One example will suffice: the report wants, through incentives and subsidies, to boost the low level of interest shown by young people in agricultural work and country life.
However, a functioning market and a competitive environment would solve this problem in a natural way.
Perhaps the only at least partially positive aspect of the report is the demand for fairness, which is particularly important for Slovakia and the new Member States.
If the EU decides to continue even after 2013 with the former costly and ineffective policy of support for farmers, it should apply equal rules for everyone.
<D>
Mr President of the Republic of Latvia, the right honourable Valdis Zatlers, it is a very great pleasure for us all to be able to welcome you today on your first visit to the European Parliament.
I should like to start by thanking you, as the President of a country which is still a relatively new Member State of the European Union, for accepting the European Parliament's invitation to address us today, the day on which we are celebrating the 10th anniversary of our common currency, the euro.
Today is a premiere in every sense of the word, as this was the first time that the European hymn has been played to welcome a guest to plenary here in the European Parliament.
(Applause)
May I take this opportunity to mention once again today the historic significance of the enlargement of the European Union in 2004.
It took over 60 years to bring your country back into a free and democratic Europe and unify our continent.
We live today in peace, freedom and democracy.
Our citizens enjoy prospects that our forefathers could only have dreamed of.
We must and should rejoice in that.
It is true that today the European Union faces new and serious challenges.
Even the people of Latvia have come to feel this quite clearly, for example as a result of the financial crisis, which has also hit your country hard, Mr President.
The gas crisis between Russia and Ukraine is also giving the citizens of Latvia justified cause for concern.
It is precisely in times of crisis that we understand the value of membership of a European Union based on the principle of solidarity between its peoples.
It is precisely in this time of crisis that we all feel the need for community and cooperation between our countries and the European institutions.
Together we are stronger, together we can defend our interests and values better throughout the world.
That is also why the European Parliament hopes the Lisbon Treaty, which gives the European Union a stronger capacity to act to overcome these serious challenges, will shortly enter into force.
In this respect, the European Parliament elections due to take place in June this year are immensely important, because we want to push ahead with the success story of the European peace and unification project together, in a democratic European Union with a European Parliament with codecision powers in nearly every area.
I truly hope that the citizens of Latvia - and of all the other Member States of the European Union - will understand that their vote is important because it gives them European powers of codecision and in this sense will turn out in force during the forthcoming elections to the European Parliament.
Mr President, it gives me great pleasure to invite you now to address the European Parliament.
May I warmly welcome you once again to the European Parliament.
(Applause)
<D>
Ladies and gentlemen, you will have noticed that the next three questions all relate to Pakistan.
Unfortunately, I cannot use the Rules of Procedure to invite the Council to answer all these questions together as the Council has structured its work otherwise.
I must draw your attention to the need for the reform of Parliament and, in particular, to what you, ladies and gentlemen, need to do in relation to the essential reform of Question Time, on which I believe we are all unanimous.
However, unfortunately, we cannot apply more flexible rules as we have Rules of Procedure by which we must abide.
I therefore have to put these questions one by one, which probably means that not all three will be answered.
Depending on how our work goes, we will see whether we are more or less productive.
I will start with Question No 15 on Pakistani military assets.
This question is by Mr Rutowicz and I urge the Council to answer this question directly.
Subject: Pakistani military assets
It is widely known that Pakistan's army dominates the country's economy and administration.
Does the Council intend to draw up an analysis to assess the total assets built up through military-related business while Pakistani society has suffered impoverishment?
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I wish to start by informing Ms Haug and the other Members of this House that the Commission has not only examined this resolution, but can also agree with a significant number of points, not least in respect of the principles of budgetary discipline and sound financial management.
We appreciate this opportunity to hold an exchange of views at an early stage in the 2009 annual budget procedure.
In that spirit I also fully share the view expressed in your draft resolution that we should start reflecting on the consequences of the Lisbon Treaty on the budget procedure.
The Commission has also taken note of Parliament's continued support for activity-based budgeting and its proposal to come forward with ideas for pilot projects and preparatory actions before the summer.
This will no doubt improve the possibility of a smooth and timely implementation.
The Commission also appreciates Parliament's detailed examination of the 2009 APS, which was the subject of an intensive debate last March.
The APS serves as a consistent reference framework for preparation of the preliminary draft budget and the Commission's legislative and work programme, although it does not predetermine the final outcome, which will take account of the European Parliament and Council priorities.
It is on this basis that the Commission will adopt the preliminary draft budget for 2009.
In terms of policy development and programming implementation, 2009 is the third year of the current programming period and should be a year of consolidation.
Accordingly, the Commission has not proposed, in the APS, any major changes in financial programming.
It has, however, proposed three main initiatives with a limited impact on the allocation of financial resources in 2009.
Firstly, as part of our policy on the integrated management of the external borders, there is a reinforcement of Frontex in the budget, as already decided, in 2008, by the budget authority.
Secondly, to follow up the EU's new strategy on Central Asia adopted by the Council in June 2007, the Commission is proposing to frontload assistance to that area in 2009, while keeping the total allocation over the period the same.
Thirdly, in line with the Bali road map, it has proposed reinforcing support for the environment and the sustainable management of natural resources in developing countries.
In making these proposals, the Commission has taken care to carefully limit the impact on the available margins, and will continue to do so when presenting its PDB.
I shall conclude by stressing an important point.
During the course of the 2008 budget procedure, a number of joint declarations were agreed with regard to agencies, both executive and centralised, and the detailed information that should be available to the budget authority.
The Commission will implement those provisions during the 2009 budget procedure, and I am confident this will afford Parliament a clearer picture of the resources available.

. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, first let me thank the rapporteur for the legislative proposal and the rapporteur for the own-initiative report.
The 2003 and 2004 reforms were important stages in the reformation of the common agricultural policy (CAP).
The thorough examination of the CAP is not a fundamental reform in itself, but rather another important step in securing a modern, multifunctional and competitive common agricultural policy.
Nothing has changed in relation to priorities.
The first concern is food production, followed by fodder and then the supply of energy.
The significance of milk production, particularly in mountainous areas where grassland farming is often the only option, has already been discussed.
In this case we are preserving jobs, not just the environment, something equally important in my opinion.
I believe that preparing for the soft landing following 2015 is an important issue.
At present I oppose a general increase in the milk quota.
I believe that we should be cautious at a time when we have this high milk surplus.
Anyone who points to food prices as a reason for increasing quotas fails to recognise that a dairy farmer receives less than 30% of the sale price, while the sale price in the supermarkets - even in my own Member State - is currently the same as it was 25 years ago.
It is important that the second pillar should be stabilised without eroding the first.
We welcome the re-evaluation of Article 68 thanks to the Member States' autonomy of decision.
I am also pleased that an agreement has been reached on the milk fund, including in relation to production in mountain areas and disadvantaged regions.
Finally, may I say that I hope very much that the Council and Commission will reach a compromise in the coming days.
I am certain that the common agricultural policy will be developed to ensure that we also have multifunctional, sustainable agricultural production in all regions of the EU in the future.
<D>
During an economic crisis, when the citizens of Europe are being subjected to waves of redundancies and cuts in social services, the European Union must also make savings.
Next year, the EU plans to spend about EUR 123 billion, which is seven billion more than this year.
In difficult economic times, measures are, of course, needed to stimulate the economy, but it is doubtful whether instruments such as the European Economic Recovery Programme can achieve this.
In the past, much-vaunted EU programmes have turned out to be paper tigers.
In addition, various EU subsidies have proved to be an invitation to commit abuses of many different kinds.
For years, the European Court of Auditors has been identifying in its annual reports blatant faults in the agricultural and structural funds.
This means that hard-earned taxpayers' money has, for years, been trickling away into mysterious channels.
The complicated regulations which even Brussels eurocrats often find confusing are a major contributor to the defective nature of the system.
The EU does not even have control over the recovery of funds which have been paid out mistakenly.
Therefore, continuing to inflate the EU budget is the wrong route to take.
Instead, the errors should be eliminated from the system by means of far-reaching renationalisation measures, for example, in the agricultural sector.
This would allow the Member States to decide for themselves which areas they want to subsidise.
As far as the measures to stimulate the economy are concerned, these should form part of a coordinated approach by the Member States.
<D>
(LV) Mr President, Vice-President of the Commission, President-in-Office of the Council, while listening to a few of my fellow Members today, I realised the old truth written in the scriptures: to criticise, to belittle, is easy, but to build a house, to create a temple, is a long and difficult task.
I must remind critics of this Treaty that its basis - the Lisbon Treaty, the Constitutional Treaty - was created in the most widely represented democratic forum in European history, with participation by non-governmental organisations, and in the presence of the mass media.
Therefore I would like, today, to congratulate my colleagues Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Corbett, who have drafted the report on which we are now going to vote.
This report is in fact a very good summary, a very good summary, and Mr Bonde is right in saying that the consolidated version is currently available only in English.
I would therefore suggest that the document be published as a brochure, as a very good summary, since not everyone will read the full Treaty.
Touching now upon the actual positions taken by the Treaty, there was talk about many good things, and there was also criticism.
It seems to me to be very good that a common foreign and security policy has been formulated, as well as the need for a common energy policy.
At the same time it is a shame that there are no new instruments for carrying out these policies - neither the Commission nor Parliament have been given such instruments.
What does this mean?
It means that the work is still before us: to introduce these policies and to implement them.
Therefore, in fact, half the work has already been done: the foundation has been developed, but the rest of the work, the second half, namely putting it into practice, still remains for us to do.
I wish us all luck.
Thank you.
<D>
in writing. - I urge the Hungarian Presidency to look into problems of freedom of movement in the field of education and the job market.
Today, mutual recognition of qualifications obtained in educational institutions of different Member States, as well as experiences in various job markets, is facing numerous obstacles.
The existing situation: While the Commission is doing an assessment of the progress on education, I call upon the Hungarian Presidency to ensure that this problem will be addressed seriously also in the Council.
There is a need to convince the Member States to agree on easier procedures in recognising educational qualifications regardless of the country where they have been obtained.
I welcome the will of the Hungarian Presidency to energise the creation of an integrated European gas pipeline system that should end the isolation of some Member States, including Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
I would like to remind the new Presidency that the European Parliament has adopted two important documents about energy solidarity and safety which need to be implemented by the Council.
I hope that the February European Council will agree on a new European energy strategy.
This should also include a plan for the Baltic Sea energy connections network.
<D>
The next item is the joint debate on the following:
the report by Mr Tremosa i Balcells, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a Council Regulation entrusting the European Central Bank with specific tasks concerning the functioning of the European Systemic Risk Board [05551/2010 - C7-0014/2010 -;
the report by Mr Sánchez Presedo, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directives 1998/26/EC, 2002/87/EC, 2003/6/EC, 2003/41/EC, 2003/71/EC, 2004/39/EC, 2004/109/EC, 2005/60/EC, 2006/48/EC, 2006/49/EC and 2009/65/EC in respect of the powers of the European Banking Authority and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority - C7-0251/2009 -;
the report by Mr Giegold, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a European Securities and Markets Authority - C7-0167/2009 -;
the report by Mrs Goulard, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on Community macro-prudential oversight of the financial system and establishing a European Systemic Risk Board - C7-0166/2009 -;
the report by Mr García-Margallo y Marfil, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a European Banking Authority - C7-0169/2009 -;
the report by Mr Skinner, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority - C7-0168/2009 -; and
the report by Mrs Ferreira, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, with recommendations to the Commission on Cross-Border Crisis Management in the Banking Sector.

(SV) Slavery has not yet been abolished, as many in this House have already emphasised.
Modern day slavery takes the form of the sex trade, and it is going on here and now.
The bodies of women, girls and boys are sold like pieces of meat, just like any other goods, and it is happening all the time.
People are robbed of their most basic human rights and become the slaves of our times in our various Member States.
This ought to be seen as Europe's greatest failure and shortcoming, and it must be dealt with by restricting and stopping both supply and demand.
In my home country of Sweden, a law entered into force ten years ago under which it is illegal to purchase sex.
This law is important, because through it, society signals that no human being is for sale.
The slave trade to America was made illegal in 1807, but it is still going on right in our midst in Europe.
It is time that it was consigned to the dark recesses of history.
It is our time and our responsibility to do all we can and I would like to thank the authors, Mrs Hedh and Mrs Bauer, for their excellent work that benefits us all.
<D>
(FR) Mr President, the Lithuanian Parliament voted yesterday for a law on homosexuality, on propaganda on homosexuality and bisexuality.
The Lithuanian President had already refused to sign this law.
It was referred back to the parliament.
This law is in direct opposition to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and Article 6(1) of the Treaty of Lisbon.
I call on you, Mr President, on behalf of this Parliament, to protest against this law in the name of European values, since the Charter of Fundamental Rights, as reproduced by the Treaty of Lisbon, provides for non-discrimination in relation to sexual orientation, and this law discriminates against sexual minorities.
On behalf of this Parliament, I call on you to write to the Lithuanian Parliament to state that this law goes against the common idea of Europe.
(Applause)
<D>
(PL) Mr President, no one denies that the rules of the Single Market and competition are the driving force behind the European economy which guarantees its swift development.
Work establishments which do not face up to this challenge will have difficulties, including liquidation, and it is obvious that the employees of those establishments will protest.
However, last week's protest by Polish shipyard workers must be viewed differently.
They did not come to Brussels to complain in order to arouse sympathy or ask for money.
They wanted to protest against a decision which they considered to be another death sentence on their shipyard, and will put at least a thousand workers on the street.
So what is the issue as far as they are concerned?
To the shipyard workers who were in Brussels the issue is one of a level playing field and ensuring that the Commission decision is based on reliable, verified information, because reality shows that the shipyard is getting off the ground and that it finally has a chance of being a profitable undertaking.
EU law has allowed additional aid in similar situations.
We have examples set out in the Treaty when the eastern German Länder benefited from such aid.
I also want to emphasise that it was not a protest by the Polish government.
Those protesting were citizens of the European Union - shipyard workers with a right to do so, who organised themselves and came to draw our attention to the fact that something wrong is happening.
We should welcome that fact because that is how we build a civic society.
And one final thing: their presence in Brussels also demonstrates the fact that they have enormous trust in the European Union and that trust is expressed by Polish society as a whole.
Neither we nor the European Union should fail to live up to that trust.
<D>
Mr President, tomorrow Parliament will decide on the various parts of the climate package.
This will mean that, in a very short time, we have negotiated our way forward and taken decisions on important parts of future European energy and environment policy.
It also means that Parliament and the Council will have completed the climate package long before we have got very far with implementing and taking decisions about the energy markets.
It ought actually to have been the other way round, which is to say that we should have been able to complete the decision-making in relation to the electricity and gas markets and cross-border markets long before we got to this point.
The energy market we are now constructing within the framework of the climate package requires a properly functioning energy market across Europe's borders, with competition to keep prices down.
We should also ensure that we can utilise every single energy source that we have available to us in Europe.
The system has become a little confused between the market package and the climate package in this area.
What we can do now is ensure that we make headway with these negotiations as quickly as possible.
It is, of course, up to the Czech Presidency to get the negotiations started as soon as possible, perhaps, as suggested here earlier by one of my fellow Members, in Strasbourg in January.
However, tomorrow when we decide on the climate package, the French Presidency will also be required to handle the situation and to initiate a process that enables the negotiations to start immediately and the discussions on unbundling, better competition and cross-border connections to get underway as soon as possible.
This is important, not only in order to keep prices down and to allow more competition, but also in order to ensure that the various Member States who, as a result of the climate package, may find themselves in a more vulnerable situation, do not become isolated.
This is something that needs to be done, and I hope that most of it will be carried out under the Czech Presidency.
However, Mr President, Minister, we do not want to allow the French Presidency to evade its responsibility in these final days of December 2008.
Thank you very much.
<D>
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the directive on European Works Councils was pioneering at the time of its adoption in 1994.
Although it only set minimum requirements, it opened the way for employees of Community-scale groups to have the right to be informed and consulted, and was one of the founding elements of European labour law.
But today, it lags behind changes in corporate reality, and behind the financial focus of the governance of companies, and it even lags behind other directives on informing and consulting employees that have been adopted since.
It is therefore absolutely necessary to revise it, to ensure that in Community-scale groups, receiving information in good time and ensuring a high standard of consultation mean that alternatives can be found where employees are facing decisions about restructuring, site closures and massive job cuts.
Too often over the last few years we have witnessed sudden decisions to make collective redundancies without the possibility of employees really being consulted or their representatives really being able to have their say.
Sometimes employees hear on the radio that they are going to be made redundant.
Their representatives are only informed a few minutes before the decision is made public, generally at the time the stock exchanges open.
All of this underlines the urgent need for a revision.
Furthermore, this revision was provided for in the text of the original directive, and in 2000 the mechanisms of this directive should have been updated.
Since then, BusinessEurope - or UNICE as it was at the time - has done everything it can to block this revision, to ensure that the consultation ended in nothing.
That is why, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Bushill-Matthews, as rapporteur for the European Parliament with others in 2001, and having helped to get the request for an ambitious revision of this directive adopted by a large majority in Parliament, as was the case again in 2007, I cannot accept this criticism of the European Trade Union Confederation.
It is sincere and it is prepared to negotiate.
If this consultation, this negotiation results in nothing, it is up to the Commission to use its right of initiative.
The Commission has a monopoly on the right of initiative.
We respect that.
However, that also gives it a responsibility, that of defending the general interest of Europe, of not allowing it to be held hostage by private interests, of ensuring that employees on our continent can count on the European Commission to defend their right to consultation and information, in good time, so that a genuine European social dialogue can exist in the major Community-scale groups.
<D>
I have decided to use most of my time for this intervention to highlight the names of people who, reportedly, are in detention in Iran, some convicted to death, for criticising the political regime or for defending civil rights.
Ali Mehrnia, Parviz Varmazyari, Majid Rezaii, Alireza Nabavi, Ali Massoumi and Shirin Alavi Holi are reportedly being detained and subject to the death penalty for 'Mohareb', which means enmity against God.
Thirty-three women belonging to the Mourning Mothers of Iran, whose children have been killed, disappeared or detained in post-election violence, are being harassed.
Other women activists and their families are detained: Atefeh Nabavi, Shabnam Madadzadeh, Mahsa Naderi, Fatemeh Ziaee Azad and Nazila Dashti.
Eight activists from the Committee of Human Rights Reporters are detained: Saeed Kalanaki, Saeed Jalalifar, Shiva Nazar-Ahari, Kouhyar Goudarzi, Saeed Haeri, Parisa Kakayi and Mehrdad Rahimi.
Four others went into hiding after being summoned to the Ministry of Intelligence: Hesam Misaghi, Saeed Habibi, Navid Khanjani and Sepeher Atefi.
Others from the Liberal Student and Alumni Association are detained: Mehrdad Bozorg, Ehsan Dolatshah and Sina Shokohi.
What these people have in common is to have reported on, or voiced, their concerns about the situation in Iran.
What is the Commission or the Council going to do for the release of those imprisoned for political purposes?
What funding does the Commission provide to human rights NGOs working in Iran?
<D>
Madam President, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs on the good work that they have done on these reports, which I commend to the House.
I think this support should be very warmly welcomed.
If Member States take this opportunity to use up the 4% of European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) funding to facilitate investment in energy efficiency in the housing sector, this will make a positive contribution both to our economies and to the environment.
It is good to see a proposal such as this, which tackles problems of the economic crisis and the environment simultaneously, coming from the Commission.
The report is especially good news for many of the old Member States, and I am glad to see that old EU Member States will now be allowed to utilise a proportion of ERDF funds for interventions which promote energy efficiency in the housing sector.
I am glad to see that the criteria for eligibility have been widened and will not be limited to low-income housing.
However, we must also be aware that this does not represent any increase in funding.
It is now up to the national and regional authorities to make use of this opportunity to redirect the percentage of their ERDF funds for funding towards these projects.
This may entail reprioritising parts of their operational programmes.
I feel that, in the long run, this will be well worth it.
<D>
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to congratulate our fellow Member Mr Schmitt, who has brought his experience to bear in his report.
I stress that sport and children's participation in sports activities are very necessary today in view of the changes that have taken place in our everyday lives.
Children these days spend much of their time in front of the television, video games and computers.
Their diet is anything but healthy.
Child obesity has become an increasingly serious problem inevitably entailing serious health hazards.
For children sport is not only a way of exercising and developing new group skills; it is also recreational and teaches teamwork.
The physical exercise involved in doing sport has a beneficial effect on young people's physical health.
Commissioner, children are not eating more, but they are less active and get less exercise.
A sedentary life and obesity often cause high blood pressure and diabetes, which affect a steadily increasing proportion of the EU's population.
Member States today must promote physical exercise as a school subject in order to prepare children for a healthy lifestyle.
Member States and the competent authorities must ensure that greater emphasis is placed on the promotion of health in the curriculum, and that physical education is given equal status with other subjects on the timetable.
Member States must also lay down a minimum requirement for the number of physical education lessons in schools.
Lastly, the Member States must actively support all forms of physical education and promote dialogue between parents, PE teachers and sports associations outside school.
<D>
(NL) Mr President, reports on anti-discrimination directives always bring out the worst in this House; this is particularly regrettable, as they often contain a great deal of good proposals and ideas for helping people with disabilities, for example.
This does not change anything in substance, however.
The amendment by Mr Weber, Amendment 81, does indeed state all the essentials; this Commission proposal is not a good one.
It has to go, not only because it entails far too much red tape, but also, in particular, because it essentially infringes the principle of subsidiarity.
Unfortunately, we all know that this amendment does not stand a chance, as this House never loses an opportunity to show its most politically correct side and always opts for more bureaucracy and more decision-making over the heads of European citizens.
Aside from this, aside from the infringement of the principle of subsidiarity, this report also contains numerous proposals that run directly counter to elementary democratic principles and principles of the rule of law.
One example is Amendment 54.
While the whole report makes a big hoo-ha about not discriminating against people, this amendment advocates discrimination on grounds of non-politically correct beliefs - but then, at the end of the day, this is what a great many other aspects of this report set out to do.
Hidden in a catalogue of worthy principles and pseudo-good intentions lurks the judicialisation of political correctness.
It is not about anti-discrimination measures, then, but very often about genuine muzzling laws to undermine freedom of expression yet more, and strengthen a kind of progressive opinion terrorism still further.
The essential question is and remains: what on earth has this got to do with Europe?
Leave to Member States what is theirs, for heaven's sake.
<D>
(SV) Mr President, like everyone else, I would like to thank Prime Minister Reinfeldt for coming here.
My first question concerns the environmental assessment of the gas pipeline in the Baltic, one of the world's most polluted seas, on which Parliament recently had an inquiry involving several committees.
Sweden was the first country to have environmental impact assessments.
This question is one of the most important environmental issues for Sweden and the EU.
Will Sweden demand yet another alternative with the pipeline laid on land which has to be subjected to an environmental assessment?
The operators tell us in Parliament that it would be too expensive.
But both the Prime Minister and I come from Stockholm, where infrastructure and investment must all have practically doubled in cost.
I cannot believe that a cost increase of 10-15% is a strong counter-argument.
The environment is more important.
My second question relates to cluster bombs and the like, which are now being debated in the Oslo process and in Wellington, New Zealand, and were considered in the Swedish Parliament last week; it is also an important EU issue.
I have received letters signed by many organisations in Sweden, such as Amnesty International, the churches through Diakonia, the Red Cross, UNICEF, Svenska Freds (the Swedish Peace and Arbitration Society) and the United Nations Association of Sweden, demanding that Bombkapsel 90 (BK90), carried on Swedish JAS aircraft, should be treated as a cluster bomb and included in the international work on a comprehensive ban.
What is the Government's position on the JAS bomb?
Does the Prime Minister consider BK90 to be a cluster bomb or not?
Does the Prime Minister intend to act in the continued Oslo process?
Finally, I would like to know when the Prime Minister intends to act in order to end our periodic relocation to Strasbourg, after EU Minister Malmström collected a million names and signatures?
Should not Parliament itself decide on its place of assembly and not the Council?
I would also like to offer my heartfelt thanks for the statement you made on Turkey.
Finally, let me say that, when they return during the Swedish Presidency next year, the Prime Minister and other members of the Government will be welcome back, often!
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (PL) Madam President, back in 2001 when it was decided that Beijing would host the Olympic Games, many of us believed that despite the controversy surrounding it, this decision would help to bring about political change in Communist China.
We felt that the host country would be moved to put an end to widespread violations of human rights and increase the scope of fundamental freedoms on its territory.
I agree with Mr Mann that with 7 months to go before the Games open, all those hopes have proved in vain.
The opposite is actually the case: the rule of terror in China has intensified.
Human rights defenders like Hu Jia and his wife are imprisoned and held illegally without trial in unknown locations, harassed, terrorised and denied the right of defence.
The Chinese authorities are sending out a different signal to the world, indicating that there is no democracy or openness in their country.
At the same time, the Chinese Olympic Committee has determined that the Games' main slogan will be 'One world, one dream'.
They maintain that this dream consists of a common aspiration to flourish and live in peace.
One is left wondering what kind of peace the Chinese have in mind and whether they really understand what the Olympic Games are all about.
<D>
Vocational education and training are an area which has acquired particular importance in recent years.
Introducing a European Credit System for Vocational Education and Training will help develop and expand European cooperation in the education sector.
It will also help improve the mobility and portability of qualifications at national level between different sectors of the economy and within the labour market.
Vocational education and training are a crucial part of Europe's efforts to tackle the social challenges presented by ageing societies and to realign its position in the global economy and resolve the economic crisis.
For this reason, I feel it is important for Member States to validate non-formal and informal education, especially at a time when the number of graduates from vocational education and training is going to fall dramatically between 2009 and 2015.
At the same time, however, there will be a significant increase in the need for staff with vocational qualifications who can take up the vacancies on the labour market.
Consequently, I believe that it is particularly important for European agencies to actively support the partnerships between Member States and European companies in this area, on the basis of a cost sharing scheme.
<D>
(FI) Mr President, firstly I want to thank the rapporteur, Mr Paasilinna, who has done a splendid job.
I voted in favour of this proposal.
Just as when this proposal was made the subject of debate and I had a few opportunities to discuss it with the President of the Commission, I still think it is important that the basic priority is to strengthen the position of existing universities and their opportunities for networking.
Institutes should not be established for their own sake.
It is fundamentally important to ensure that the Institute is a coordinating body and that the appropriations for research are not conducted away from existing universities and research institutes, which have done excellent work.
The new Institute could coordinate European innovation and technology and thereby generate new added value.
The Institute is needed, but as I said, its content must be the core issue, and not how it is organised.
I believe that suitable premises are available in Poland and elsewhere, but the content should not be forgotten.
<D>
Mr President, I understand that this proposal for a Council decision, as outlined in the report, provides for the conversion of EUROPOL into an EU agency.
We must recognise that this will have two consequences.
First of all, funding will have to be provided from the Community budget, and EUROPOL staff will acquire the status of Community officials.
The report also contains provisions for coordination, which we all welcome, and organisation and implementation of investigations and operational activities carried out in conjunction with the Member States' relevant authorities or by joint investigation teams.
The Conservatives favour open cooperation between police forces across the EU and beyond in the fight against crime.
But we really do not accept that the EU has any role in centralising such cooperation.
Thus, EUROPOL is an agency which is not necessary since other organisations already exist to fulfil this function at a global level.
It is for this reason that I would like to add that the coming ratification of the European Constitution, despite its rejection in two referendums, is undemocratic, cowardly and illegitimate.
<D>
(FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, many organisations and political parties are fuelling an absurd ideological campaign against this text, which they are exploiting and misrepresenting for political ends.
With this directive, we are offering people in situations of vulnerability safeguards to ensure that return takes place in full respect for their rights and their dignity.
It does not concern the right of asylum, Mr Catania.
I get the impression you have not understood this yet.
We will not let our citizens think that their representatives are responsible for a text wrongly labelled the 'Shameful Directive'.
We do not need to be ashamed of a text that introduces new safeguards.
The real shame is those who are blind and cannot see, or do not want to see, the progress it allows.
Do we want to incorporate the principle of voluntary return?
Do we want to allow Member States to maintain an unlimited period?
Do we want justified decisions?
Do we want legal authorities to control the conditions of detention?
Do we want free legal aid, and NGOs on hand?
Do we want to incorporate the principles of family unity, the best interests of the child, and medical assistance?
All texts can be improved, but this directive constitutes progress in comparison to what exists today, where each Member State does what it wants, sometimes unacceptably - is this not so, Mrs Roure and Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert?
Ladies and gentlemen, I call upon you to vote for this compromise so as not to give way to the political manipulations of certain people on this text and so as to keep in mind the concrete improvements it brings.
<D>
(PL) Mr President, China's role in global economic development is a particularly important one.
China is also a success symbol for the people of Africa.
In the course of the last 25 years China has created opportunities for 400 million of its citizens, lifting them out of extreme poverty.
In addition, over 200 million Chinese have joined the middle class.
China therefore has a wealth of experience in generating economic development.
It is expected that this will also have a positive impact on African countries.
Trade between Africa and China is estimated to have increased from USD 4 million in 1995 to USD 55 million in 2006.
Africa represents an important source of raw materials for China.
The Chinese economy requires ever-increasing supplies of energy and raw materials.
China is therefore doing all it can to establish a permanent presence in Africa.
<D>
Madam President, I tried to undermine the compromise by voting against those parts of this report.
I will explain why by reading out a letter to me from James Mowbray, who is a farmer near Skegness in my region.
He said, 'I have personally been involved in the application of crop protection products for over 40 years.
I have always applied products with a sensitive approach to other human beings as well as wildlife.
I have incurred no apparent detriment to my health or the wellbeing of the environment.
I therefore find it distressing that the possible withdrawal of many products, including the triazole fungicides, is based on less than scientific arguments and will make my business not particularly viable and reduce the availability of home-produced food'.
I received these comments from him and from literally hundreds of other people, from Empire World Trade, based in Spalding in Lincolnshire, John Manby in Parker Farms in Leicester, John Clark, who is based in Nottinghamshire, Jonathan Reading and hundreds more names.
That is why I voted to undermine the compromise.
<D>
in writing. - (RO) The latest developments on the global markets of agricultural products have generated a situation that few governments are prepared to deal with.
The spectacular price increases, especially for basic cereals, risk starvation for millions of people.
This new reality should receive an answer from governments and European institutions.
This new level of agricultural prices presents new opportunities for producers, including for those of the EU Member States.
In Romania, 40% of the population live in a rural environment, many of them being agricultural producers.
The new realities of the markets of agricultural products represent a chance for them to improve their economic results and, implicitly, to increase their living standard.
Unfortunately, the agricultural segment reacts very slowly to price changes on global markets.
Small producers deal with heavy bureaucracy and are disadvantaged when negotiating purchase contracts against big chains of distributors with dominant positions on the market.
The EU should support small agricultural producers in order for them to benefit from higher income from their work.
The access of small agricultural producers to the markets should be facilitated and global distributors should be subject to transparent regulations, which would prevent anti-competitive policies.
<D>
Mr President, civil aviation seemed to be a luxury in the past, when mostly the rich and the so-called jet society used the advantages of quick flights.
Nowadays, at least in the European Union, civil aviation is a necessary part of our life, without which the Parliament and the Council simply could not work.
If the distance from Brussels is more than 1 000 km, there is no realistic alternative to flights in the absence of rapid trains.
With the accession of the new Member States and the boom in low-fare airlines, we have two or three times more flights than before the enlargement of the EU.
International aviation is not yet covered by the Kyoto Protocol.
However, direct emissions from aviation account for about 3% of the EU's total greenhouse gas emissions, and this is increasing fast.
I think that the quantity of the three allowances should have been based on the emission rate per capita of greenhouse gases in the different Member States, as there are large differences between them.
I feel that it is unfair that western European countries have the right to emit around three times more greenhouse gas from aviation as Hungary and other new Member States.
I think this principle should be applied in other environmental policies requiring a total amount of decrease instead of a percentage decrease.
Otherwise, those who polluted less in the past will be punished.
<D>
I definitely endorse Barbara Weiler's report on the transposition, implementation and enforcement of the Directive concerning unfair commercial practices in the internal market and the Directive concerning misleading and comparative advertising.
The issue of misleading and comparative advertising in business-to-business transactions has been regulated by the introduction of a single, consolidated directive.
The issue of unfair commercial practices in business-to-consumer relations has been regulated by Directive 2005/29/EC.
The Directives were prepared to give consumers more confidence (their protection has increased due to the drawing up of a 'blacklist' of commercial practices which should be prohibited, and thanks to better harmonisation of the protection of consumers against unfair practices) and also to provide businesses with greater legal certainty.
A greater degree of protection could have been achieved if the provisions of the Directive were accompanied by legal measures allowing effective enforcement.
Member States must therefore screen their legal systems and increase the clarity of the transposition process.
The changes introduced must be supported by clear procedures for implementation and effective measures for redress, which will give consumers the right to bring claims for damages for losses incurred in connection with unfair commercial practices, like the mechanisms for monitoring consumer protection in relation to airline websites first used in 2007.
At the Member State level awareness campaigns and campaigns which improve levels of consumer education on the subject of consumer rights and their use should be considered.
<D>
Despite its good intentions, the report continues and even extends the policies which are at the root of problems experienced by many small producers, particularly in Portugal.
Invoking what they call 'promoting the quality of European agricultural products', they increase production costs for those who are already having difficulty keeping themselves in production.
This is especially true for small producers, as is the case for many small cheese dairies producing Serra da Estrela cheese of undeniable quality.
It is unacceptable that producers should have to meet new requirements in order to continue producing, without the financial compensation that is due to them, whilst also having to support the costs of the 'official control' requirements.
Contrary to the claims made, production of real quality is at serious risk of disappearing.
Applying harmonised production and marketing standards to both small producers and agro-industry is unacceptable.
The application of these standards is destroying the diversity, in terms of production and of culture, of countries like Portugal.
It is important to reverse this trend and promote production and consumption at the local level.
Agriculture must be considered a sensitive activity, incompatible with this model of commercial liberalisation that is environmentally unsustainable and poses enormous risks to human health.
<D>
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (GA) Madam President, agriculture should not lose out in a World Trade Organisation agreement.
Commissioner Mandelson is currently negotiating a very uneven deal, which would be detrimental to European farmers and the entire EU agri-food sector.
It seems to me that the US electoral calendar is dictating the timetable for the WTO negotiations.
Such nonsense should not be tolerated.
The content and substance of the agreement is far more important than any election.
Although Ireland is the fourth largest exporter of beef in the world, it would be badly hit by this agreement.
The domestic beef and lamb market in Ireland, which is currently valued in excess of EUR 2.5 billion, will be undermined by the WTO agreements.
The reduction in import tariffs of up to 70% on beef and lamb products being proposed by Mr Mandelson is simply too much.
10,000 farmers marched on the streets of Dublin last week in protest against President Barosso's visit to the city.
Mr Barosso knows the full wrath of the Irish farmers and it is time he reined Commissioner Mandelson in.
Finally, it is imperative that we reach an agreement in the World Trade Organisation - an agreement that would be to everybody's satisfaction; an agreement that would benefit Europe, farmers and agriculture; and an agreement that would safeguard food sources.
<D>
- (FR) Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, I think that we need to stop being hypocritical regarding this issue.
In 2006 I myself was part of a European Parliament delegation that travelled to Turkmenistan, and we made a number of proposals at that time which you have taken up, Commissioner.
Clearly, I understand your arguments and those of the Council, but when I compare what has been proposed and the report on Central Asia - which we voted in favour of in this very House a few months ago, on 20 February 2008 and in which we repeated our demands concerning the release of prisoners, the Red Cross, and so on - has there really been any progress?
No.
Personally, when I read 'Turkmenistan report', I actually read 'Nabucco report' because, at the end of the day, we are interested in the energy, in the gas of this third biggest gas-producing country in the world.
Furthermore, I know - it was explained to us very well when we were in Turkmenistan - that, were the European Union not interested in Turkmen gas, then the country had other customers, not least China.
So let us avoid being hypocritical, let us make it plain ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
<D>
President-in-Office. - (SL) The European Union is committed to multilateralism in many forms, including the World Trade Organisation, which in our view is an excellent example of a multilateral organisation.
Many decades prior to the actual founding of the World Trade Organisation, Europe called for the creation of such an organisation for trade.
Later, the European Union had a key role in the creation of the World Trade Organisation within the Uruguay round of negotiations.
Actually, if I may say so, it had a key role in that last round of the negotiations, which is why the support the European Union gives to multilateralism in trade cannot be doubted.
Similarly, the EU had a key role when the agenda for development was adopted in Doha at the 4th Ministers' Conference of the World Trade Organisation in 2001.
During the negotiations which followed, the European Union purposely decided to direct all resources and political will to concluding that round of negotiations.
Prior to that round of negotiations or at the time of the actual negotiations, there were no parallel negotiations concerning bilateral trade agreements.
In October 2006, the European Commission submitted to the European Parliament and the Council a report entitled "Global Europe, competing in the world”.
The report discusses recent changes resulting from the globalisation process.
It offers suggestions for the European Union's response to that process on the basis of the updated Lisbon strategy, especially in respect of trade policies.
On the basis of the report, the European Parliament adopted a resolution and the Council made decisions.
The Council's decisions clearly show that all future bilateral agreements on free trade are going to form the basis of future multilateral negotiations and, what is possibly even more important, they will be complementary to the World Trade Organisation platform.
Under the terms of the negotiation directives adopted by the Council in the spring of 2007, negotiations on free trade agreements were started with the member states of ASEAN and with India and Korea.
Those negotiations are ongoing and each individual decision will be finalised in due course.
<D>
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the insertion of the new Article 149 into the Treaty of Lisbon constitutes recognition of the major economic and social role played by sport.
The detailed report by Manolis Mavrommatis highlights the numerous areas of life affected by sport, and I should like to look at just a few of them.
The first is the relationship between sport and health: although everyone is well aware by now that physical activity is essential in order to remain in good shape, there is a worrying tendency in certain EU Member States to reduce the number of hours devoted to sport in schools.
This trend, combined with a poor diet, is creating an army of obese youngsters, with the possibility of negative repercussions on their physical condition.
Sport is an original and enjoyable way to learn a language.
Back in the early 1970s I learned of a very well-organised and widespread system of study vacations in the United Kingdom geared to learning the language of Shakespeare through the practice of various sporting disciplines.
Sport ought to support brotherhood among nations, but unfortunately that is not always the case: we regularly witness scenes of indescribable violence inside and outside of stadiums, especially in the case of football.
Amateur and professional sport, uncontaminated and unpolluted sport, sport as a personal development tool, an instrument of cohesion and solidarity among peoples: we are still a long way away from satisfactory standards in Europe, Mr President, and the responsibility lies entirely with politics.
We can only hope that the White Paper on Sport will act as a wake-up call and reverse the trend once and for all, so as to make up for an excessive lack of sensitivity and too many sins of omission.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, my fellow Member Mr Goebbels said after his speech that despite his criticism, he would not die for Nice - which I very much hope he will not, and that he will live for a long time.
First and foremost Nice is not a treaty for which it would be worth dying!
I hope that this Treaty which we are getting will at least have a much higher added value than Nice.
I would like to take up where Mr Lambsdorff left off.
Our citizens want a strong European Union, not as an intrusion into daily life, but as an outward representation in order to be better able to represent our citizens.
I now think that this treaty, for all its weaknesses, still represents substantial progress.
It is a necessary, albeit insufficient, prerequisite for us to pursue an active foreign and security policy.
The Kosovo problem is, of course, preoccupying us.
We shall see whether there is the will generally to promote a common foreign and security policy.
Both the Portuguese and the Slovenian Presidencies are having to gear themselves up intensively for what we are doing, should no amicable solution be reached here.
However, it is important that we create the appropriate conditions in the long run.
I would like to bring up two things here: on the one hand, we do of course need a workable diplomatic service, which must be located at the Commission.
It makes no sense to place foreign policy with the Vice-President of the Commission and High Representatives if the diplomatic service then simply has to be organised elsewhere.
On the other hand - something several fellow Members like Enrique Barón Crespo and others have already pointed out - we must make clear that this Parliament has been involved from the outset in the appointment of the High Representative.
Finally, one further comment to the Vice-President of the Commission: you repeatedly point out how important the negotiation of this treaty is.
The matter will not be settled - as my colleague Mr Schulz has said - with the agreement which will hopefully be reached in the Council and not even with ratification, but our citizens must be convinced during and after ratification that this Treaty will help them by allowing their interests to be represented in this world.
<D>
(SK) Despite the fact that time-wise the second half of the year is not the most ideal, during their Presidency of the Union, the French have proven that they are justifiably considered a leader and driving force of the Union.
I have been a Member of the European Parliament for four and a half years.
I can positively say that France has had the most active approach to resolving the problems of all 27 Member States of the Union.
The historic change brought about by electing the charismatic and very active President Sarkozy is indisputably positive.
His abilities were also demonstrated in his immediate response to the problem of Russia and Georgia.
The financial crisis also erupted in that period, to which the French promptly responded by proclaiming the need for a systemic solution and revision of the Union's control and financial mechanisms, including from the global standpoint.
It was during the French Presidency that the European Union earned the reputation of an active player in world politics, when the G8 and G20 summits were convened upon the initiative of the French President and President Barroso.
I believe that the forthcoming European Council meeting will be successful and that all European institutions will proceed jointly.
<D>
on behalf of the UEN Group. - Mr President, I would like to welcome the President-in-Office as well as the President of the Commission to discuss what our elders, wise men and some would say our betters - although I do not necessarily agree with that - will be discussing during the summit over the coming days.
Rather than going back over everything that my colleagues have said, because I can agree with most of the contributions, I would say that it is not one or the other but rather a combination of all: trying to drag the best ideas out of all the different proposals that have been put forward and utilising them as the unique model which Europe must follow.
I say that because our experience over the last 30 years, and in particular the last 20 years, has shown that it is not either one or the other.
You cannot have economic growth without proper social cohesion and social protection.
You cannot have protection of the environment without proper investment in new resources, information technology and research and development to create the innovative ways of dealing with the problems we are now facing.
Likewise, you cannot solve unemployment simply by saying that we want more jobs.
You have to encourage companies and businesses to create the jobs, to invest the money and to create the wealth.
Only so much can be done by public services, whether it is public investment for infrastructure or whatever else.
Ultimately it comes down to businessmen and businesswomen in small and medium-sized enterprises - which employ 62% of all the people employed within the European Union - investing more money in creating more and more jobs.
That requires a certain amount of flexibility.
However, flexibility should not be a byword for a diminution of standards or of the protection of workers' rights.
Likewise, you cannot use one bad example, like the Laval case - bad enough as it is - to say that everybody else must be controlled to the most rigorous level.
It must be used as a starting point, not as the end game.
Look at the challenges that we face in the European Union today: our lack of investment in proper research and development.
The best and the brightest from European universities and institutions are leaving Europe to do their research and further work in America, Japan and now even China.
And look at the relocation of European industry and business: it is not to other countries within Europe, which was the case 10 or 12 years ago; it is now outside the European Union, to India, Pakistan, Malaysia and other countries.
What we really need to be focusing on now is not just where the sudden subprime market difficulties are creating short-term difficulties today.
If we look back over the last 25 years of the economic markets, they go in cycles: there are troughs and there are highs.
What we have to ensure is that the foundation stones that we put down today will be as strong in 15 years' time as they are today, that they will continue to deliver economic growth and that they will continue to deliver security of energy supply.
The President of Estonia told us here yesterday that Russia is now acting like a superpower, to use its superpower status in oil and gas to influence foreign policy.
We must ensure that there is solidarity within the European Union to face up to and to meet that challenge.
Our best and most valuable asset is our young people.
If we do not invest properly in education and training and give them skills and opportunities in the European Union, we risk losing them.
Finally, let me say to the President-in-Office that I want to pay a small tribute to the young people in Slovenia for their work during Slovenia's Presidency - particularly those in the protocol section - and the welcome and the image they give of Slovenia as a country.
<D>
(ES) Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I offer the Czech Presidency the same friendly welcome that I gave in 1991 when, as President of the European Parliament, I addressed the Senate of the then Czechoslovakia to invite them to join us.
In my opinion, that great generation of Czech and Slovak citizens is embodied in someone who is well-respected in Europe and throughout the world.
I am of course talking about President Václav Havel.
I have two comments and questions for the President-in-Office.
You have taken a decision - and I am glad that you are talking about a Europe of rules - to subordinate ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon to ratification of the missile defence shield.
Many of us believe that this is not the way forward, but you have taken the decision to subordinate your own country to something that must be considered jointly.
There is one fact that cannot be ignored, however, which is that the gas dispute is a political dispute.
In my view, it will be very difficult for you to have a policy towards the East in this situation.
I also cannot understand why, when the Czechs are a people proud of their sovereignty and independence, you can subordinate what the Czechs have to decide to what the Irish do.
Secondly, President-in-Office of the Council, you have not mentioned the euro.
Yesterday in this House we celebrated the 10th anniversary of the euro and the entry of your sister republic, Slovakia, into the euro.
What are you going to do in order to defend the euro during the Czech Presidency?
<D>
(DE) Mr President, migration is one of the priority topics in the European Union.
The Euromed region is, in that respect, a strategically important region for us.
The Euromed ministerial conference on migration will be the first of its kind to focus solely on this issue and include the Euromed partners.
It is therefore all the more regrettable that no consultation with civil society organisations was held in advance of the conference.
It is equally regrettable that the aspect of asylum was excluded from the agenda for the ministerial conference, especially bearing in mind the hopeless situation of refugees in many parts of the southern and eastern Mediterranean due to the lack of appropriate legislation to protect them.
None of these countries, as we know, has any asylum laws.
Only a few of them recognise the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Libya, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan have not ratified the Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees.
It is also to be regretted that the members of the Barcelona Process talk about the rights of migrants but are silent when it comes to the rights of illegal migrants.
The fact is that illegal migrants also have rights, especially when it comes to the enforceability of wages, access to education for their children, or basic medical care, especially for women migrants, where the relevant protective provisions apply.
If we want cooperation in our efforts to combat illegal migration, we must not deny or neglect one aspect: respect for the rights of migrants and refugees.
<D>
(PL) Madam President, I am distancing myself from the utterances of my fellow Member, Konrad Szymański, and associating myself fully with those of Mr Pinior.
Poland signed the Sixth Protocol abolishing the death penalty and took upon itself the legal obligation of eradicating this form of punishment from our land.
On 17-18 June last year in Luxembourg, European Foreign Ministers, all European Foreign Ministers, including the Polish Foreign Minister, agreed that the European Union should submit a joint draft resolution against the death penalty.
What has happened since 17 June to make Poland change its view in September?
Obviously it must be the domestic situation, and obviously it must be the elections.
But can we say in fact that Poland has changed its view?
It is not Poland, it is the Polish government.
Poles are not barbarians, they do not accept the death penalty.
Poles have stood against the death penalty on many occasions.
And I have to say to you, and especially to Mr Szymański, that public opinion polls indicate that 57% of Poles do not want the death penalty.
Please remember this when representing Poland, and convey what Polish society thinks, with this trend in mind.
<D>
I would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Podimata, for her report.
I believe that the directive on labelling and informing consumers about products' energy consumption is of paramount importance.
The European Union has proposed to cut energy consumption by 20%.
If we manage to inform consumers correctly so that they have an option available to them based on the information they have been given, then we can actually cut energy consumption for products currently in use too.
As regards labelling, it must be simple; this is a vital element.
It must also be complete and naturally offer consumers the information which they need to be able to make the necessary investment.
This is why I believe that it is important for the label to mention information about energy consumption or about the energy savings which could be made.
In addition, I think that it is important to have this A-G scale, which is simple.
However, I would like to mention that I believe it is important for the period of validity to be specified so that the consumer has information even from the time when certain products are advertised.
I do not believe that the obligation to provide information about energy consumption will interfere in any way with the freedom of expression and the provisions concerning the mass media.
I think that it is in all our interests to have well-informed consumers who can make an enlightened decision to reduce their energy consumption.
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur.
This is a very important document which is part of an energy efficiency package.
I will continue to support us having an interesting debate, even during second reading.
<D>
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, I promise that unlike Mr Bushill-Matthews, the previous speaker, I shall not speak about cyberspace and the opportunities that navigating around it could open up for the citizens of Central and Eastern Europe.
The draft resolution is full of praise for EURES, the European Employment Service.
We should be aware, however, that for some observers EURES is an example of overgrown European bureaucracy.
As my fellow Member from Lithuania pointed out just now, barely 8% of Lithuanians who went abroad to work used the instruments offered by EURES.
This amounts to very few indeed.
Perhaps this is not actually a case of overgrown bureaucracy, but the matter would be much more straightforward if the European labour market were eventually fully liberalised.
Europeans would then be able to go job-hunting in the normal manner, and would not necessarily use EURES.
Of course all methods should be supported, including official information about vacant jobs for seasonal or temporary workers.
This should concern citizens of the Member States of the Union in the first instance.
Citizens of third countries should come second, including nationals of countries working with the Union in the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy.
Two years and two months ago, as we adopted the guidelines on employment policy in the Member States we emphasised the need to remove all obstacles to the free movement of workers in Europe as envisaged by the Treaties.
It is unfortunate that Germany, Austria and certain other Member States failed to heed that appeal and still retain barriers preventing access to the labour market.
This is contrary to the fundamental freedoms on which the European Union is based, as my fellow Member stated.
Free access will eventually come about, but much time will have been wasted in the interim.
We should discuss general solutions hic et nunc, not half-measures.
<D>
As proposed, we are carrying out a trial vote, i.e. a vote to check that we all have cards, we are all seated properly and that the equipment is working.
Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to repeat: once every five years the European Parliament decides who will lead another European Union institution.
Today's agenda includes electing the President of the European Commission.
This election will strengthen the democratic nature of our institution.
It is we, the elected representatives of all European regions, who will do this.
The Council of Europe has nominated José Manuel Barroso as President of the Commission.
In accordance with Rule 105(2) of the Rules of Procedure, Parliament may approve or reject the nominated candidate by a majority vote.
The ballot is secret.
Let us now proceed to elect the President of the Commission in accordance with the Rules of Procedure.
The vote will be held using the electronic system.
I would like to repeat that you can vote from any position in the plenary hall as long as you place your voting card into the personal voting device.
I say this because there are many new MEPs in the House.
As usual, in the vote you may vote for or against the candidate, or abstain.
(The vote is held)
Here are the results of the vote: 718 Members voted, 382 in favour, 219 against and 117 abstentions.
(Loud applause)
<D>
in writing. - (RO) I voted for the report regarding the adjustment of the multiannual financial framework, presented by our colleague Böge.
The amounts not used in 2007 from the commitment appropriations for the Structural Funds, the Cohesion Fund, the Rural Development Fund and the European Fund for Fisheries should be carried forward for the upcoming years.
Thus 2.034 billion euros will be transferred, according to 48 of the Interinstitutional Agreement, for 2008-2013.
The amounts will be allocated mainly in 2008 (approximately 56%), and during 2000-2013 the influence of this transfer will be insignificant.
We have to analyze the reasons that have led to a lack of use of these funds.
First of all, there are 45 operational programmes that were submitted late to the European Commission for approval.
72% of the reprogramming required is due to delays in rural development programmes.
Some were sent to the Commission in December, thus making it impossible to adopt the programmes in 2007.
National institutional constraints and a lack of previous programming experience are some of the causes for these delays.
Most of the 45 delayed operational programmes come from the new Member States.
I request the Commission to assist them more in acquiring the new procedure and training the personnel assigned to the use of these funds.
<D>
(SK) Poverty always provides fertile soil for totalitarian leaders wishing to pose as the saviours and defenders of their people.
In reality they do this only for their own benefit.
At first, Hugo Chávez did not talk about socialism but only about the right to a better world.
With the passage of time, however, he did start talking about socialism.
His opponents were not invited to cooperate and they became his mortal enemies and later on political prisoners.
He then interfered with media freedoms and those who would not toe the line were shut down.
One-sided information, the leader-defender, violations of human rights, lack of freedom: this all adds up to totalitarianism.
The case of Manuel Rosales only confirms what I am saying.
Other leaders playing the same game as Hugo Chávez include Castro's heirs, Lukashenko and the like.
I would like to thank all my fellow Members of the European Parliament for sending a clear signal to the whole world via these Thursday afternoons during the plenary session that the European Parliament will never tolerate human rights violations anywhere in the world.
Madam President, I would like to thank you for chairing our meetings in the European Parliament, for your cooperation and for your personal friendship.
<D>
Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, we followed very closely the evolution of the situation in Italy.
We are worried about the growing street crime and wish to express, first of all, our sympathy to the families of individuals who have been victims of criminal activities.
We welcome the bilateral cooperation measures announced last week by the prime ministers of Italy and Romania.
We will ensure that the rights of Romanians are respected, as all citizens' rights should be.
Under the transitional arrangements to the complete opening of labour markets, Romanian nationals must apply for job permits in certain Member States.
We will make sure that Member States observe the principle of non-discrimination in their national legislation and administrative practice.
The Free Movement Directive, Directive 2004/38/EC, allows for the expulsion of European citizens when an individual represents a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the fundamental interests of society.
This is a decision to be made on a case-by-case basis and in the full respect of the guarantees of substance and procedure.
In cases of immediate expulsion, the urgency must be duly justified.
Under the Directive, the host Member State may expel European citizens also if they no longer fulfil the conditions attached to their right of residence.
Inactive Union citizens may be expelled if they become an unreasonable burden on its social assistance system; in other words, if they do not have legal financial means to guarantee proper daily living conditions.
In this case, expulsion shall be based on objective elements and a ban on re-entry cannot be imposed.
Expelling European citizens is an extreme measure.
It is a limitation of one of the basic freedoms of the Treaty.
Measures should be taken to strike the right balance between the right to free movement and the duty of each Member State to react in the interests of honest citizens when the legal conditions to stay are not fulfilled.
The Italian authorities officially notified the Commission of the text of the decree on 7 November 2007.
The decree must be adopted by the Italian Parliament within 60 days.
As you know, the Italian Parliament has the power to change the text of the decree.
The position of the Commission on the Italian legislation transposing Directive 2004/38/EC will, of course, depend on the final version of the law as it emerges from the Italian Parliament.
The decree entered into force immediately, but the Directive is sufficiently precise in its terms to be directly applicable by national courts.
This means that if a Union citizen considers that the individual expulsion measure taken against him or her does not respect the guarantees laid down in the Directive, he or she can appeal before the national courts.
In case of doubt on the application of European law, as you know perfectly well, national courts are obliged to refer the issue to the European Court of Justice.
We will continue to monitor the situation, pending the examination of the decree by the Italian Parliament.
We are also worried about some racist and xenophobic demonstrations that have accompanied the introduction of the decree in Italy.
Roma groups are the largest minority in Europe.
Roma communities throughout Europe face difficult conditions.
There is a long past of persecution.
This situation leads to human suffering and social tension.
Inclusion requires efforts by everyone concerned, including the Roma themselves.
Specific protection must be given to individuals, children and women especially.
Criminals of whatever nationality very often exploit particularly vulnerable people such as children.
Roma children face double discrimination.
Firstly, they are victims of stereotypes and prejudice.
But also they may face violations of their fundamental rights, even from within their communities.
We see, too often, neglected Roma children on our streets or living in poor, often tolerated conditions in modern European favelas.
Children may be brought into a life of crime or forced to beg.
Roma schoolchildren tend to leave school early without qualifications for the future or skills to care for themselves and their families.
If we only look at a group when we consider how to protect fundamental rights, then we risk missing the protection of individuals within that group and we miss the opportunity to break the circle of wrongdoing and fear.
We are ready to assist Italy and Romania in making the best possible use of all possibilities already existing under European law and under European funds.
It should be also stressed that Roma communities live in many other Member States such as France, Ireland, Spain, Slovakia, the Czech Republic or Hungary.
The social inclusion of Roma communities can also be further improved in these Member States, notably through the structural funds, which can be quite helpful.
European funding, specifically targeted at the needs of Roma communities, is already available in areas such as social inclusion, the fight against discrimination, regional development and education.
In the previous programming period, the structural funds made available more than EUR 275 million for Roma-related projects.
An additional EUR 60 million was made available to Romania and Bulgaria between 2004 and 2006, under the pre-accession instruments.
The funding of Roma-related projects will continue in the structural fund programming period 2007-2013.
The European Racial Equality Directive (2000/43/EC), which covers Roma people, provides for protection against discrimination in employment, education, social security, health care, goods and services, and housing.
We are actively ensuring that this legislation is applied across the EU.
Finally, as much as the Commission is not prepared to tolerate any form of discrimination or intolerance of its citizens, we equally will support Member States who lawfully protect their citizens from criminality, whether they are nationals or citizens of the Union in general.
After all, freedom, justice and security go hand in hand.
<D>
Mr President, economic growth of 7%, a large increase in the number of children attending primary school, more countries whose people are demanding democracy: in the least developed countries in Africa, much progress has been made in the past 10 years.
These countries have worked for better governance and mobilised their own financial resources.
The rich countries' particular contribution has been debt relief and ensuring the availability of vaccines.
However, we are not there yet, because rapid economic growth in the poorest countries has not gone hand in hand with a proportional reduction in poverty.
The list of the poorest countries has remained virtually unchanged for decades.
The number of people living on less than USD 1 a day has decreased, but the number of people living on less than USD 2 a day remains the same.
The rich countries have kept corrupt regimes in place, rather than considering a fair sharing of resources.
It is therefore absurd and cynical to say that development is not working.
We have not given it enough of a chance.
The UN conference in Istanbul will have to draw some conclusions from this.
Much more attention needs to be given to the equitable distribution of wealth within the poorest countries themselves.
This will provide stability and a fair distribution.
This will eliminate tensions and bring peace.
Social justice will also do much more to bring about economic development than the inequality of dictatorships ruled by a small clique at the top.
Countries with democracy achieve fair distribution much faster than dictatorships.
Good governance will bring us closer to achieving the Millennium Development Goals.
We also need to do more for public health.
For a family in a poor country, disease is a financial disaster.
Disease is a luxury which no one can afford.
We must therefore work towards financing healthcare through health insurance, so that not only vaccines are available, but also good hospitals and clinics.
<D>
Mr President, we have not been able to hold a debate in plenary on this very important report, which is why we feel it is necessary, on behalf of the Committee, to take the floor before you today.
We have all worked together, and I commend the outstanding work of the shadow rapporteurs.
We visited no fewer than 26 detention centres in 10 EU Member States, and we noted several key points.
We observed, in certain centres, an obvious state of decay and an obvious lack of hygiene, and we denounced the failure to respect human dignity.
We found that access to healthcare was not always possible and that the children's right to education was not always respected.
We call for respect for clear, fair, effective and proportionate asylum procedures, and we call for the implementation of a permanent system of visits and inspections of detention centres.
We must show the reality on the ground and stand up for a right to inspect these centres - something that these kinds of visits permit - and we must do so in order to take action so that things change.
The press has asked me why we did not cite any countries in this summary report.
I replied that it was my choice, that it was our choice, since we have a collective responsibility with regard to what goes on in detention centres in Europe, and the purpose of this report is not to rank the Member States.
We will not stop calling for European solidarity in the area of asylum.
We cannot leave the Member States, at Europe's borders, on their own to face large migratory flows.
I repeat once again: we have a collective responsibility.
(Applause)
<D>
Mr President, the report we have in front of Parliament today rightly states that tax competition in the EU has led, and continues to lead, to EU-wide economic gains by way of a dynamic corporate environment.
The CCCTB could just as easily lead to a less competitive EU and should not be supported, in my view.
The EU needs to be responsive to an ever-changing global economy.
Modern competitive economies need to be flexible to meet the changing requirements of new products and services.
The CCCTB will undermine this flexibility for a number of reasons.
An EU-wide corporation tax base will be inflexible and hinder an individual country's ability to decide its own legal fiscal strategy, based on its particular circumstances.
The CCCTB's proponents assert that each Member State will retain its autonomy to determine its national tax rate - but will they?
Is the CCCTB not the thin end of the wedge?
If the CCCTB is optional, it merely increases the number of bases available to companies and makes the system even more complex.
Domestic tax law offers certainty to business.
A system that is applied in a number of Member States may lead to differences over how the provisions are interpreted, bringing about uncertainty for business.
In the remaining time available to me, I can simply make some bullet points.
First, taxation is a matter of national sovereignty for each Member State.
The right to choose the level of public spending and the funding of such expenditure is a basic function of national democratic process.
It is necessary to protect the flexibility of tax policy in rewarding enterprise and the creation of jobs and growth in the economy.
A single base would do away with flexibility.
There is no evidence to suggest that a common consolidated corporate tax base will address issues such as competitiveness, compliance costs for companies, transfer pricing and so on.
It would not simplify EU tax issues, as the so-called 'optional system' proposed would add another layer, as I have just said.
The harmonisation of the tax base would lead to pressure on national tax rates.
Such harmonisation will only increase the attractiveness of non-EU corporate locations.
The Code of Conduct on business taxation addressed harmful tax competition.
Different tax rates in EU Member States are not harmful.
I would ask the Commissioner, when he brings forward these proposals, as he suggests, next year, to please bear this in mind.
Member States like Ireland have already given...
(The President cut off the speaker)
<D>
Madam President, how many recognitions are necessary for a state to be independent?
This is not the question, since the quality of the recognitions matters more than the quantity.
A declaration of self-determination does not lead to independence if the state in question is not recognised by those from which it wants to self-determine.
The independence of a state is not real as long as the United Nations Security Council does not accept it.
Moreover, a state is not independent if it is not able to offer to all communities living on its territory a fair prospect of organic integration into a civic and multicultural society, and if it is not self-sustainable and self-governable.
For all these reasons, the Athisaari Plan failed.
Asking for the status quo ante is not a solution either - one should move further.
To this end, the European Union and the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council must convene an international conference which should find a sustainable solution for democratic security, geo-strategic equilibrium and social economic stability in the Western Balkans.
Within this framework Kosovo should be put back on the track of international legality, and the region should receive a clear road map for its EU integration.
Unfortunately, the Lagendijk report does not explore such ways thus abandoning any realistic drive towards a better future.
Therefore, Romanian Social Democrats will be obliged to vote against this report.
<D>
Mr President, one of the lessons to be learnt from the recent referendum in Ireland is that a good PR campaign makes a big difference.
In June 2008, the Irish people voted against the Lisbon Treaty.
A little over a year afterwards, they voted by a two-thirds majority in favour.
Did the European Union have a much greater impact on their lives in the interim?
No.
But the message of the European Union was sold far better by the 'yes' side in the second campaign.
Particularly now with the Lisbon Treaty coming into being, I think it is important with the new competences that much good work will be done.
However, the Commission must also engage in a proper PR strategy to bring that good work home to the citizens.
So I would ask the Commission what plans they have in that regard so that future referenda will be passed much more easily than in the past.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the House much prefers dealing with expenditure to revenue - and so it is to Mr Staes' great credit that we are today turning to the trifle of revenue for once.
All the same, this is a matter of EUR 17 billion in VAT and own resources and EUR 14 billion in customs duties - which is almost 30%.
In my opinion, it is good that we are addressing this issue today.
Evidently, there are only winners here, and the Commissioner, too, deserves our congratulations for this.
We are pleased that we have managed to find a way -in cooperation with the Member States.
It is essential to shore up the future of OLAF, the European Anti-Fraud Office, to enable it to play its role within the EU even better and more efficiently.
Congratulations are due for what OLAF has shown us so far and what we are seeing before us now.
We are all very proud of these successes, as it was these experts, of course, who made them possible.
It was not a foregone conclusion, particularly given the subject, that we would make real progress with the counterfeit tobacco products dossier or that the Member States, too, would cooperate.
We should like this scenario to be replicated in the case of other dossiers concerning the protection of the financial interests of the Union, for example the fight against VAT fraud.
Then we would have true winners: the European taxpayers who sent us here and have certain expectations.
I believe that continuing the fight against cigarette smuggling is an important task, that there is an urgent need to call in an investigator from OLAF in Beijing, and that we need to strengthen the anti-fraud presence worldwide.
The question to the Commission now would be how to step up the pressure on other cigarette manufacturers to induce them to subscribe to the agreement between Philip Morris and the Community in the Member States.
In my opinion, we must consider very specifically how to follow this up and how to continue working on this issue, as failure to do so would endanger our own credibility.
<D>
Very briefly, Mr President, I would first like to thank all my fellow Members and congratulate them on this triumph, which belongs to all the groups in this House.
This is a victory for Parliament as a whole.
(Applause)
I must thank two million European doctors and a million medical students for the work they have done, and I must also thank the European Trade Union Confederation and all the national trade unions, who have worked so hard.
Mr President, it is important to remind the Council that this is not a setback, but rather an opportunity to rectify a wrong decision.
It should see it as an opportunity to bring our agenda closer to that of the citizens.
We must ask the Commission to don its referee's outfit and take off the Council shirt that it has been wearing these last three years.
Once it has its referee's shirt on, let us go to conciliation, so that reconciling work and family life can become a reality, together with the social Europe.
(Loud applause)
<D>
rapporteur. - Mr President, I have enjoyed this debate.
I have enjoyed the wild allegations that have been made about this change, that raising the threshold for creating a group in this Parliament from 20 to 25, or perhaps 30, would somehow be the end of democracy and the end of pluralism in Parliament.
What utter nonsense!
This is a modest proposal.
Even 30 would be well below the threshold that exists in most national parliaments, which we all find perfectly democratic.
So why not here?
The idea that this is an attack on existing groups is nonsense.
I was glad the UEN Group spokesman recognised his group would not be affected.
I was surprised that Mr Batten thought his group would be affected.
I thought he was expecting to gain seats in the next European elections.
I rather think they will lose seats and that they will be annihilated so that they would not even meet the existing thresholds.
So they will not be affected one way or the other in any case.
As for the idea that this is targeting a particular viewpoint such as Eurosceptics, as was alleged, also what nonsense!
Eurosceptics have always been represented in this Parliament, well represented, have almost always had a political group and I am sure that will continue to be the case.
They represent a small but significant strand of public opinion and of course they should take part in our debates.
That will not be changed by this proposal.
This proposal is not a radical one.
It is a sensible, common-sense, practical proposal to examine what is a sensible level in an expanded Parliament to have a threshold for creating a political group.
It is not a radical proposal, it does not target anybody.
I am glad that many groups are seeing the sense of compromising between the two views on this matter and finding a compromise around the modest proposal of 25.
<D>
Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would once again like to thank your rapporteur, Mr Stockmann, who has prolonged our dialogue.
We - and I, personally - engaged in dialogue with the airports and the airlines.
Thank you, Mr Stockmann, for having listened to both sides because it is not easy to establish, to some extent, the rules for good dialogue that allow balanced solutions to be achieved and that ensure that airports in dominant positions cannot abuse that position.
I will now respond to your questions, Mr Stockmann.
As far as the number of passengers is concerned, we feel that 5 million is acceptable.
It is essential to take the networks into account and I accept that.
However, I am very reluctant to support the delegation of duties to regional authorities.
This could be dangerous and I do not see how it would be of any benefit.
We need an impartial authority that will ensure that the airports concerned are subject to the same conditions regarding dialogue and the determination of charges.
I support the differentiation of charges according to environmental criteria.
However - and I am going to come back to this - there is no reason to envisage any pre-financing of infrastructures.
When looking at how to manage an airport successfully and the charges to be collected, it is obviously necessary to anticipate future infrastructure requirements.
There is no need for pre-financing.
In addition to those answers, I would now like to respond to some of the comments made.
Firstly, I would like to say to Mr Simpson that the directive has managed to stay away from regulation and bureaucracy.
What we want to see is respect for the basic principles.
The Member States have already accepted these principles within the framework of the International Civil Aviation Organisation.
We do not want to introduce regulation for the sake of it.
I honestly believe that we can genuinely say that we have found the best framework for ensuring good dialogue between the airlines and the airports, and, in my view, it is as part of this dialogue that progress will be made in the area of transparency.
Mr Allister said that the directive was going to make regional airports more expensive.
Quite the opposite is true, however!
On the contrary, through transparent accounts, through this obligatory consultation, through non-discrimination among carriers, we will in fact ensure, particularly in certain regional airports, that there is complete transparency and that it is easier for the consumers, the passengers to travel by air, without any nasty surprises.
As I said, and I am responding here to Mrs Lichtenberger, the directive allows the Member States to establish charges or taxes on the basis of noise pollution or other environmental aspects.
However, since this directive is trying to stay away from over-regulation, we do not need to define every one of those taxes.
In response to Mr El Khadraoui, I would say that it will certainly be possible to adjust the charges on an environmental basis.
The Council proposed this and I intend to support it.
Some of you have asked me about the problems concerning flight cancellations.
To be honest, the text does not deal with that issue, so it is difficult for me to respond.
There has been a great deal of progress on passengers' rights, and that must continue.
I would ask you, Madam, to contact me in writing so that I can provide a more precise response to your question, which, I admit, is quite legitimate, like that of Mrs Ţicău, who also spoke.
Mr President, I would now like to outline briefly the Commission's position on the amendments.
A number of the amendments tabled by your rapporteur strengthen the Commission's goal of improving the relationship between airports and airlines.
Mr Stockmann, the Commission can take over 21 of the amendments that contribute to that objective.
I would mention, in particular, the amendment on the definition of a charge, Amendment 12, and the amendments on airport networks, Amendments 14 and 16, with a few changes to the wording.
The Commission had initially proposed that the directive should apply to airports whose annual traffic is over 1 million passenger movements.
The Commission accepts the new limit proposed in the first part of Amendment 7 since it seems to be supported by the majority of both Parliament and Council.
However, 27 of the amendments tabled by your rapporteur cannot be taken over as they stand and would need to be discussed in more detail.
These include, in particular, the amendments on security charges: Amendments 13, 21, 22, 23, 24.
This issue was the subject of long and heated debates.
A compromise was reached during conciliation and it seems, Mr Stockmann, that these amendments are therefore no longer necessary at this stage.
In addition, the directive cannot apply solely to cases of infringement of competition law.
As such, the Commission cannot accept the amendments concerning situations where airports have a dominant position in relation to their users.
The scope of the directive is broader than that.
We therefore feel that Amendment 7 in part, Amendment 16 in part, Amendment 19 and Amendment 20 are unnecessary.
Nor can the Commission accept the amendments on the pre-financing of airport infrastructures.
The collection of a tax before an infrastructure is operational is contrary to the principles on which the directive is based.
However, this does not take anything away, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, from Mr Stockmann's excellent work, which, in my opinion, has considerably improved this draft directive.
I have commented on a number of amendments, but I must once again thank Mr Stockmann and the Committee on Transport for the quality of their work and for helping us to move forward with this important text, which will enable us to structure the dialogue between airports and airlines.
We want to prevent the users from being victims of this lack of dialogue and we want to prevent a situation whereby, due to a lack of transparency, a number of practices can be implemented without any real possibility of approving them.
Those are the comments I wanted to make.
I would like to thank Parliament for its commitment to this proposal.
I think that it should provide our airports and airlines with the means of establishing permanent dialogue that will benefit all of the parties concerned.
Commission's position on amendments by Parliament
Stockmann report
Amendments acceptable: 8, 10, 11, 12
Amendments acceptable in principle: 3, 21, 27, 29, 30, 33, 35, 40, 44, 45
Amendments acceptable with redrafting: 14, 15
Amendments partly acceptable: 7 (1st part), 16, 17, 18, 22, 35 (1st part)
Amendments rejected: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9, 13, 19, 20, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 31, 32, 34, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 42, 43, 46, 47, 48

(GA) Mr President, investing in new and cleaner technologies must be a central element of EU strategies to ensure that we can reach the EU target of 25% of energy supplies coming from the renewable sector.
It is equally important that other trading blocks around the world sign up to similar commitments in the near future.
However, fuel prices are now the more serious concern for the citizens of European countries.
The European Union must put in place innovative policies to help stem the rise of oil prices.
Increasing oil production is a key element of this process.
Mr President, there is clear uncertainty in the international financial markets at present.
Many speculators have switched their investment strategies into the commodities market and this speculation has contributed to increasing pressure on oil prices in an upward spiral.
Rising oil prices is the last thing that European business and consumers need at a time of increasing economic difficulties.
The European Union needs to have a progressive neighbourhood policy in place which will ensure that we can protect and secure our energy needs into the future.
<D>
(FR) Mr President, I just wanted to remind Members that on Wednesday we will be celebrating the first World Malaria Day.
Until now it was called Africa Malaria Day.
This year, for the first time, it will be commemorated as World Malaria Day.
I wanted to remind Members that this global problem, which, by its nature, is associated with poverty, affects 107 countries in the world, and that in 90 of those countries it constitutes a major public health problem, since 40% of the world's population lives in malaria-stricken regions.
The number of reported malaria cases worldwide is somewhere in the region of 350 to 500 million per year, with more than 60% of cases being reported in Africa, leading to 90% of malaria deaths.
Every 30 seconds a child dies in Africa from malaria.
This means that, by the end of my speech, Mr President, two children will have died from malaria.
The disease is also believed to inhibit growth, as malaria reduces GDP by USD 12 billion per year.
On Wednesday, a working lunch will be held on the subject at 1 p.m. in Room C 2.1.
<D>
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Mr President, Mr Barroso's slogan is 'delivering results for Europe', but these results must also be in the area of intangible business, not only in the market.
Mr Barroso's Commission was to become the champion of citizens' freedoms and rights.
That has been very disappointing up until now, but with less than two years to go perhaps there is light at the end of the tunnel.
As far as I am concerned, the highlight of the 2008 work programme is the proposal for a directive on equality outside the workplace, that is, a general prohibition of discrimination.
At last the Commission is listening to what Parliament has been calling for over the last number of years.
Priority must be given to this matter.
However, the Commission must guarantee better compliance with the existing legislation because there is a discrepancy between the excellent anti-discrimination laws we already have and the Commission's inability to actually enforce them.
The anti-discrimination principle must also be introduced in other areas, such as inheritance taxes and wills, and the Commission must recognise modern family set-ups in this respect.
I also welcome the proposals to reinforce equality between men and women, for example by reconciling work and family life.
As regards the position of women in the labour market, the proposals for more flexibility are important.
Flexibility is, as it happens, good for women.
Rigid rules for the protection of employees put women at a disadvantage.
Intercultural dialogue has been highlighted as a priority.
The intention is to get rid of social tensions by means of dialogue, but in reality this is often inter-religious dialogue and I therefore object to it, Commissioner.
There is nothing concrete in the proposals for the coming year, and it is therefore not clear what the intercultural dialogue will be, but I fear that it might be the annual photograph of Mr Barroso with the generally conservative ecclesiastical leaders.
I would like the agenda of these ...
<D>
Mr President, President Sarkozy is reported in the London Times as saying the Irish 'are bloody fools.
They have been stuffing their faces at Europe's expense for years and now they dump us in the s-h-i-t' - his word, not mine.
Last week we all said we respected the Irish vote, but we are not respecting it.
We are treating the Irish with utter contempt.
Like Robert Mugabe, we are simply rejecting the verdict of the people.
Wolfgang Schäuble has said that a million Irish cannot decide for half a billion Europeans.
Very well then, let the rest of us vote on this treaty.
You dare not do so because you know that we too would vote no.
This very month the EU lost its last pretence of public consent or democratic legitimacy.
It has been revealed for what it is, which is an authoritarian conspiracy against the people.
The referendum was in Ireland, but it was here in Brussels that democracy finally died.
We are here today to bury it.
<D>
- (PL) Mr President, EU integration is passing through a series of phases.
As a result of implementation of the Schengen Agreement, another group of states will enter the area which border restrictions and controls have been lifted.
We welcome this, as a considerable proportion of Poland's eastern border is also an EU border.
The entry into force of the Schengen provisions has obliged on Poland to carry out extra controls on this border.
I am thinking particularly of the border with Ukraine, a state that is becoming an important EU partner since its democratic and economic transition.
Poland and Ukraine are linked by centuries of history as neighbours.
Today we need especially close contacts and cooperation between our citizens and our peoples.
We must therefore create good conditions and make it convenient for people crossing the Ukrainian-Polish, border - that is, the Ukrainian-EU border - while keeping unnecessary administrative requirements and costs to a minimum.
This should not be a border of division, but one of neighbourly cooperation - a border that in future will persist only formally, on paper, when Ukraine becomes integrated into the EU - and let us hope that it will.
<D>
Madam President, I would like to thank the Minister, Mrs Malmström, for everything she has told us, and which I will try to confirm on behalf of the Commission.
On 15 July, the Commission proposed the abolition of short-term visas for citizens of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia.
As you have underlined, Minister, this is obviously an historic moment in our relations with the Western Balkans.
This proposal for the abolition of visas is based on the progress made in the last six years in the areas of justice and home affairs, in accordance with the commitments made at Thessaloniki in 2003.
The Commission proposal has been submitted to the Council.
The Member States support the approach proposed by the Commission and confirm their intention to work in close cooperation with the European Parliament to guarantee the formal adoption of the text during your Presidency, Minister, the Swedish Presidency.
I thank the European Parliament for appointing the rapporteurs within the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and for setting an indicative timetable scheduling the submission of the report for the end of September, and the votes within the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and then in plenary, for October and November.
The goal is, in fact, to obtain visa exemptions for citizens of Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro on 1 January 2010.
The Commission's proposal is based on the results of the dialogue launched in the first half of 2008 with the five countries of the Western Balkans.
Road maps have been drawn up stipulating criteria, the realisation of which involves the adoption of structural reforms in the key area of JFS - justice, freedom and security.
This method has proved to be a very important incentive for the countries of the region to progress towards reforms, notably in relation to document security, with the introduction of biometric passports and identity cards for border control and global policies on migration, and also in relation to public order and security policies: the fight against organised crime, corruption, human trafficking, and finally, of course, fundamental rights, including matters of citizenship.
Having studied these reports, we can say that the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia meets all of the criteria in its road map.
Montenegro and Serbia have made very considerable progress.
However, for Serbia, there are still some conditions to be met, in particular, with relation to the verification of identity documents submitted by Kosovo residents and people of Kosovan origin living abroad when they request a Serbian biometric passport.
The second condition for Serbia is the control of borders with Kosovo and cooperation with EULEX, and thirdly, the drafting of a national strategy on migration.
As for Montenegro, a lasting solution must be found for displaced persons.
Measures still have to be taken in terms of the effective introduction of the law on foreigners, as well as measures enhancing administrative capacity and which are designed to fight corruption and organised crime more effectively.
That is the situation in these three countries.
Despite the very significant progress accomplished in the course of the last few months, Bosnia and Albania have not yet been able to complete the requisite reforms demanded in the road map, such as the abolition of visas.
On the basis of this analysis, the Commission, in response to the invitation made by the General Affairs Council in June 2009, has therefore proposed the abolition of the visa for the citizens of Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia.
For Serbia, persons resident in Kosovo, or persons of Kosovan origin who are resident abroad and who hold a Serbian passport issued by a central authority in Belgrade, will be excluded from the liberalisation and will be required to obtain a visa.
Indeed, since 1999, Serbia has not been able to provide verification for identity documents held by people from Kosovo.
The Commission has considered the security risk that this category of people represents for the Community, as well as the fact that there has, as yet, been no dialogue on the subject of visa liberalisation with Kosovo.
Therefore, the decision to include certain countries in this liberalisation of visa requirements is based on the merits of each individual country.
As far as Serbia and Montenegro are concerned, we will follow closely the measures taken by these two countries to fully implement all of the criteria.
In terms of the progress already made by Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Commission is convinced that these two countries will be in a position to meet all of the criteria in the near future.
In October, their authorities will submit supplementary information to the Commission on the progress made in recent months.
On the basis of this information, evaluation missions will be deployed at the beginning of next year, and then the Commission will draw up new evaluation reports to be discussed with Member States.
Following this, the Commission hopes that it will be in a position to propose the waiver of the visa requirement in 2010.
In accordance with the procedures in force, the proposal will be discussed at the Council and will be the subject of an opinion at the European Parliament.
The formal adoption of the text by a majority of the Schengen countries should therefore take place during the Swedish Presidency, which will allow the effective introduction of this abolition of visas for citizens of these three countries from January 2010.
As you have said, Minister, all this means the possibility, particularly for the young generation in these Balkan countries, of participating much more in European life, of integrating into it, and we think that all of this can be extremely beneficial, both for these countries and for our Europe.
There you have it.
Those are the points I wanted to make following the excellent observations made by the Presidency.
<D>
We believe that agricultural policy needs to be deregulated and market-based if it is to be of benefit to consumers and the rural population.
Thorough reform of the common agricultural policy is therefore necessary.
All forms of export and production subsidies for agriculture should be abolished as soon as possible, and by 2015 at the latest.
Abolition of the EU and US farming subsidies is also vital if we are to combat global poverty and hunger.
During the same period, all trade barriers in respect of agricultural produce and fish should be phased out, thereby allowing free trade in food.
The part of the EU budget for 2010 that concerns agriculture falls under heading 2 - 'Conservation and management of natural resources' - and makes up what is known as Block 3.
This block contains intervention and support measures that we oppose, including various stockpiling measures - such as for alcohol - and extensive EU support for the wine sector.
It also includes EU support for milk and fruit in schools.
This in itself is important, but we believe this matter should instead be dealt with at national level.
At the same time, the block contains important initiatives in respect of animal welfare and controls on animal transports, for example, which we would, in principle, welcome.
However, since the voting procedure forces us to take a position on this group of amendments as a whole, we have chosen to abstain from voting on Block 3.
<D>
(CS) Madam President, in the context of this report, I would like to draw your attention to an urgent problem that has emerged as regards the present crisis.
In some countries - including my own - we are witnessing the mass dismissal of agency workers, the majority of whom came to our country from eastern European and Asian countries.
They have become illegal workers.
After their dismissal, they have been left with no means of support, and so become pawns in the hands of so-called 'entrepreneurs' who subject them to even worse exploitation than the agencies did.
At the same time, I would like to reiterate the very inadequate human resources that labour inspectorates have at their disposal in many of our Member States.
Nothing will change unless we set up a thoroughly trained and equipped network of inspectors who understand labour legislation and who are familiar with European directives.
While the European institutions have now agreed on certain standards for business, there is usually an outcry among the Member States whenever even the slightest attempt is made to do something similar in the field of social legislation.
Referring to tradition, subsidiarity and the like in a situation when workers in the European Union are subjected to unbridled exploitation is ridiculous and hypocritical.
For this reason, I welcome any attempts to prosecute and sanction those who employ illegal immigrants and I thank Mr Fava.
<D>
Good evening Madam President, Commissioner.
Mrs Reding, you are quite rightly delighted today that France has responded to the European Commission's infringement proceedings at the eleventh hour and has provided a legislative programme for establishing procedural rights as required under the directive on the freedom of movement.
According to your assessment, these promises are genuine and, as a result, the infringement proceedings have been put on ice - as opposed to cancelled.
We have taken note of your comments but as Members of the European Parliament, we would also like to be able to monitor these commitments.
That means having information about the promises made and the timetable provided by the French authorities.
However, let us not forget that you also asked France about individuals who have been escorted to the border and required to leave the country, an enquiry intended to confirm that these administrative procedures were not discriminatory.
What has happened to those enquiries?
Have you received a response?
Just as the press revealed information about the villainous and discriminatory August circular, information was recently published about a file - a database - which contains personal information including details of ethnic or racial origin.
Has this new twist not dented your confidence in the promises made by the French authorities and the accuracy of the information provided?
Mrs Reding, would you not agree that the logical next step is now to tell us the current state of play in the ongoing examination of the documents requested by the Commission, both on the alleged discriminatory practices in France, but also regarding the potential infringement of data protection standards as laid down in Community law?
I think that today's European citizens are entitled to demand a responsible Commission which may publicise its successes but will also be determined in persevering with proceedings against the French authorities.
After all, this is what you are doing more generally for all EU Member States which, it is widely recognised, have fallen into bad habits in relation to the Roma.
I should also point out that the CNIL has itself confirmed the existence of four illegal files which contain personal data, in which the subjects are described as Gyppos, Gypsies or Roma.
<D>
(NL) Mr President, I endorse the words of many fellow Members that the reaction today of the European Summit to the events of the past month is the right reaction.
We have spoken with one voice and at the same time maintained our composure.
However, the EU - and this is also made clear in today's statement - has let it be known in no uncertain terms that what happened there, especially the Russian reaction, is not acceptable and that the disproportionate reaction of Russia to the military developments in Georgia must be condemned.
At the same time all parties have stated that the use of military force is not the right solution and I consider that also to be an implicit criticism of the actions of the Georgian Government which started the military activities.
This reaction also shows that we believe, and rightly so, that we do not solve problems in Europe in this way, that this is not in accordance with the security agreements that we have and which were made in the past on the problems with South Ossetia and Abkhazia in Georgia.
I also distance myself from the statements of the Russian Foreign Minister, Mr Lavrov, that the way Russia reacted has set the tone for Russia's new foreign policy in the surrounding region.
I think that the European Union should do everything it can to persuade Mr Lavrov and the Russian Government that this is not the way that we in Europe try to resolve issues or press our interests.
Cooperation is the watchword, not unilateral action.
I remember discussions over the past few years about the actions of the Bush Administration.
I hope that we will not end up having the same discussion with Russia.
That is why it is so important that the Council today, under the leadership of the French President-in-Office, has called again for attention to be given to this issue and has put the emphasis on the six-point plan, especially the return to the previous military status quo.
By doing that he is laying the foundations for an international mechanism to keep the peace and particularly for an international debate about the future status of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and he is dissociating himself, and rightly so, from the recognition by Russia of the independence of these two separatist regions.
That is also our opening position for a mission to Moscow that will take place next week at the highest level and which will again have to put pressure on Moscow to implement those six points.
In these circumstances it goes without saying that our position is that, as long as there is no clarity about implementing this agreement, as long as there is no agreement, we will not engage in any further talks about the new partnership agreement.
This crisis is placing great demands on the European Union.
It is right that we take the lead in the search for solutions.
There is no alternative: NATO cannot do it, the OSCE is too weak, America is not in the position that we are in, and the UN cannot play a mediating role due to the blockades in the Security Council.
Today's summit was of one mind, let that remain so.
<D>
President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly let me say that I want no more uncertainty on this point.
The Presidency is very much motivated by this directive and is convinced of the need for having such a directive on this issue.
I would also repeat that this position has been steadily held, that it does not just date from the current presidency, and I cannot accept some of the insinuations that have been made in this regard.
In December 2007, when the first debate was held in the Council, certain Member States - and there is an echo of this in today's discussion - were formally opposed to the principle of a directive.
Other Member States were already involved in drawing up national policies in this area and were of the view that while a directive was a good idea the proposal being put forward did not adequately respect the subsidiarity principle and did not take sufficient account of the efforts that had already been made, including points of a highly technical nature.
At that time France was one of this group of states.
Today, as we hold the presidency and once again remain faithful to this position, we are very much motivated and keen to find agreement on a directive for soil protection.
For all that, we have all seen today that there are sharp disagreements and that these are a fairly true reflection of what has been happening within the European Council.
We are striving to reach an agreement that may perhaps, as we hope, yield success during the current French Presidency.
However, as we can all see, this is going to be far from simple.
<D>
(NL) The recent violence in Tibet has again drawn our attention to the position of the Tibetan people.
The situation there regarding missing persons and the dead or wounded is very unclear.
China must clarify this and allow international organisations and the media to enter the area.
This summer the Olympic Games will be held in China.
The Games stand for peace and respect.
The Games are an outstanding opportunity for the Chinese people to come into contact with sporting and cultural values from the rest of the world.
Athletes have a crucial role to play in this.
Governments ought not to interfere at this time in their athletes' participation in the Games.
Athletes can and must decide that for themselves.
On the other hand, politicians can distance themselves from the opening festivities.
I support the President of the European Parliament's idea of possibly boycotting the opening ceremony.
It is crucial that the Member States act collectively with regard to this matter.
The European Parliament must take the initiative in this respect.
<D>
author. - Mr President, some in this Chamber want to present the People's Mujahedin as heroes or a true alternative to the Iranian regime.
They are neither.
In my trips to Iraq, I have heard Kurdish, Sunni, Shia, Christian, Turkman leaders and others complain about the role of the People's Mujahedin as a tool of Saddam Hussein in the 1988 Anfar campaign, which culminated in massacres such as Halabja.
That is what the Iraqi delegation which was here this week also confirmed to us, while assuring us that the Iraqi constitution binds the Government of Iraq to fully respect the human rights of the residents of Camp Ashraf, who, with the help of UNHCR and ICRC, wish to leave for Iran or any other destination, or wish to stay as political refugees abiding by the laws of Iraq.
We must understand the reluctance of the Iraqi Government to let Camp Ashraf continue to be a nuisance to their good neighbourly relations with Iran.
For Iraqis, Iran cannot be wished away.
It is there.
It is a powerful neighbour.
It is true that the People's Mujahedin are no longer on the terrorist list, but they are still an opaque cult which brutalises those of its members who wish to defect.
Above all, the people in Camp Ashraf are human beings whose human rights have to be respected, irrespective of the fate of the organisation itself or of its past.
They are to be treated under the 1951 Refugee Convention and no one - I repeat, no one - should be forced to return to Iran.
But let us make one thing clear.
This resolution is not about the Iranian regime, which has been repressing its people, mismanaging the country and destabilising the Middle East for decades.
Anyone who presents a vote for the PSE and Green amendments, which aim to balance the tone of this resolution, as a vote for the Iranian regime, is either arguing in bad faith or has simply run out of arguments.
The spirit of our amendments is quite simple.
We want to present the whole picture of human rights violations and threats in and around Camp Ashraf.
For example, we request that all Camp Ashraf residents be allowed to be interviewed by the ICRC and UNHCR at a neutral location and without People's Mujahedin officials in attendance, in order to clarify their real wishes.
Also we must call on the Mujahedin leadership to stop controlling the lives of the residents of Camp Ashraf, namely by not letting them leave the camp.
Above all, we express our concern about the reported practices of mental and physical manipulation and severe human rights violations within the cult.
In short, this is about the individual human rights of the people in Camp Ashraf.
Let us have these people and their human rights in mind when we vote.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - The suggestion of European Consumer Centres going to court on behalf of European consumers is an idea we will discuss in our communication on collective redress before the end of the year.
So far, my concern has been to keep our minds open and to have a diversity of opinions before arriving at a final proposal.
We really need to see the whole picture and to use all the instruments at our disposal, including the Directive on Injunctions, which is also one of the tools we can use cross-border in Europe.
I fully agree about the database, which I firmly support.
We need it in order to make better policies and better legislation.
My firm conviction is that we need to be evidence-based whenever we are proposing legislation or having our common enforcement actions.
I will continue with enforcement actions in all 27 countries at the same time - the so-called 'sweeps' on issues such as airline tickets or ring tones.
Websites are normally very good clients in such kinds of cross-border enforcement actions.
Each country is different.
We need to have broadband penetration, and we need to have more than a given percentage of the population using whatever kinds of tools they use to enjoy e-commerce, which is usually the internet.
I also believe that we can enhance this penetration through cohesion policy, regional policy and the Cohesion Fund.
New Member States will have a unique possibility to catch up really fast and sometimes to avoid some of our previous mistakes.
They need to go in leaps.
If you have good, targeted legislation which is fully harmonised in all Member States, this will have a tremendous impact in raising both consumer confidence and the level of consumer performance in all Member States.
E-commerce is one of the tools for getting a better deal and for having more choice.
It is not merely a market tool, but also a very important democratic tool.
<D>
(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have now heard everything from the experts who produced the report - Mr Rasmussen, Mr Lehne, Mr Lauk, thank you very much.
It was an excellent piece of work and met with great approval in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
In the past three years, Commissioner, we have constantly been asking for rules to be established, for questions to be raised, such as: how can we obtain greater transparency for hedge funds, who is advising the rating agencies, and so on.
They now come from Ireland and are therefore racing experts.
When the fences are high, the horses may well shy.
Put simply, shying away from an obstacle that is no longer there!
We must now - and this you have indeed promised - lay down rules and make proposals.
We have to show that we have learned something from all these crises and are striking new paths.
You put forward this proposal .
I hope that in October we shall be receiving the guidelines from you.
A few days ago I was at a large conference near Rome.
The first item discussed there, of course, was that of the banks.
On the Thursday the newspaper headlines read: Morgan Stanley offers hope.
On Friday, they read: Morgan Stanley seeks protection.
How can this happen in a single day?
There are deficiencies here in transparency and the like.
If, after Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers and Merril Lynch, this investment bank is also now sinking in the chaos of the financial markets, corrective action should be taken as a matter of urgency.
A short time ago I was in China.
The Chinese were saying: our role model, the United States, has collapsed.
Together we - Europe, China and others - must seek out new paths.
My hope is that together we shall have the strength to strike these new paths, then not only those who have won, but also those who have lost will be rescued with us.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his work on this file, which has turned out to be more complicated than expected.
We take our commitment to maintaining depositor confidence in times of financial turmoil very seriously and I am grateful for Parliament's willingness to treat this issue rapidly.
However, I also have to admit that I am disappointed with certain proposed amendments to the Directive on Deposit Guarantee Schemes, especially on pay-out delays.
Let me recall that on 8 December this House voted in favour of a pay-out period of a maximum of two weeks.
However, the compromise currently on the table provides for a pay-out delay of four weeks, which can be further extended to six weeks.
When you add to this another week of decision-making by competent authorities, this means seven weeks.
Seven weeks is a very long time for depositors who are unable to buy food, pay bills or use their payment cards.
Let us not forget that the regime currently in force, which allows for a pay-out delay ranging from three to nine months, will remain in place for a further two years.
I am concerned about the message this sends to European citizens and how it will affect our confidence.
I am concerned about the possibility of having to witness once again pictures of citizens queuing at their bank the next time they hear that the bank is in trouble.
My concern is that several weeks of no access to one's funds is too long a time to keep depositors' nerves calm in a crisis situation.
I also regret that the compromise on the table is not more ambitious in increasing the level of coverage.
Let us not forget that nearly all Member States had already increased their coverage to EUR 50 000 by October 2008.
This is why the Commission proposed to send a clear signal to depositors that their protection will be increased almost immediately.
What was meant to be an immediate signal will now have to be postponed to mid-2009.
Nonetheless, the Commission will support the agreement between Parliament and the Council if it is endorsed by your vote.
It remains important that the coverage level be increased to EUR 50 000 by the end of June 2009 and eventually to EUR 100 000, and that co-insurance is abandoned from mid-June.
The Commission will come back to other outstanding issues in the report next year.
I look forward to working with Parliament on the important task of restoring confidence in the financial system among our citizens.
<D>
(SV) Mr President, Commissioner, at last!
The Commissioner and Mr Bowis have done an excellent job.
The heated debate preceding this directive is astonishing.
The European Union and we here in this House have an extraordinary opportunity in this regard to 'reconnect to the people', as we so lyrically desire and have repeatedly emphasised.
But what happens?
We hesitate, and many in this Parliament - including the Swedish Social Democrats - want to make things more difficult for patients and to hamper their chances of receiving healthcare abroad.
Why?
I can only imagine this is a desire to save the systems rather than the patients in need of care.
I am pleased that we have got this far, Commissioner.
You have taken up your responsibility.
We now have the opportunity in this House to take up our responsibility.
May the Council also take up its responsibility!
<D>
in writing. - (PL) I warmly welcomed the report on the amendment of the Directives on users' rights in electronic communications networks drawn up by Mr Harbour.
It is a balanced document intended to significantly improve the condition of the market in electronic services.
It was right to draft compromise amendments that were accepted by a significant majority of Members of this House.
This made it possible to adopt the report as a whole, despite the very large number of amendments.
The Union's legal provisions in the area of telecommunications date back to the 1990s.
I believe that the amendments to the Directives represent a great opportunity to adjust them to the tremendous technological changes that have taken place.
This is particularly important since we intend to add mobile communications and broadband Internet access to universal services.
Licence holders should be assured of the right to full information on all restrictions concerning access to legal software.
Service providers must ensure security of the network, protect users' personal data and stem the flood of so-called spam.
I believe that it is especially important to take account of the needs of disabled and elderly people, who need to have easier access to telecommunications services.
It is to be hoped that appropriate new technical solutions for equipment will emerge.
I trust that such developments will result in a significant reduction in the cost of telecommunications services across the entire Union.
At present, we are still obliged to pay unfair high prices for the transmission of data across the Union's internal borders, despite the existence of the Schengen system.
<D>
It could be said that the January energy crisis is slowly starting to turn into an annual ritual.
The more severe the winter the greater the certainty that the Russian Federation will turn off the gas supply to European countries.
It is therefore all the more surprising, in the face of another gas conflict whose victims were citizens of European Union countries, that Chancellor Angela Merkel is still pushing the proposal of building the Nord Stream gas pipeline with Community funds.
What the European Commission should be doing now is preparing a plan for diversification of energy sources.
Investment should be made in building new transmission networks which would bypass unreliable exporters of energy resources such as the Russian Federation.
In one of the amendments which I tabled to the Laperrouze report we stress the significance of supporting 'the Nabucco gas pipeline, which is the only existing undertaking which will diversify energy sources and transit routes for gas' without the involvement of Russia.
It should also be a priority to create gas interconnectors enabling connections between systems and rapid transmission of gas reserves in the event of further crises.
However, our trade agreements should be based on the special 'energy security clause', which would be the business ethics of the sector.
For Europe and the rest of the world, which conduct business in a civilised manner, it is important that the Russian Federation ratifies the Energy Charter Treaty.
I think that only the cohesive and uncompromising position of a united Europe will be able to persuade the Kremlin to make such a decision.
<D>
(PL) Mr President, EU-Belarus relations depend on both sides.
Good on both sides will bring dialogue, a real neighbourhood policy and an Eastern Partnership.
Partnership cannot be built on prohibitions and sanctions, which is why I am pleased to note the European Commission's latest initiative aimed at improving relations with Belarus.
It must be said objectively that Belarus has also done a great deal towards rapprochement.
Evidence of this is the registration of the 'For Freedom' movement, allowing opposition papers to be printed and distributed, and the country's openness to the Eastern Partnership Initiative.
The European Union's expectations go further, and there are clearly grounds for this, just as there are grounds for Belarus' many expectations.
For example, if the authorities in Belarus are being asked to end the practice of requiring exit visas for its citizens, in particular children and students, why does the European Union not simplify and liberalise visa procedures in relation to the citizens of Belarus?
These issues are particularly important to the residents of border regions, who have cultural and family ties (...)
(The President cut off the speaker.)
<D>
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I would like to express my thanks to Karl-Heinz Florenz for the very good cooperation in the Temporary Committee on Climate Change.
If we take the Florenz report and say, 'this is the state of play in the climate policy debate in the European Parliament', we might conclude that there is a wonderful 'climate' among Members here in the European Parliament, were it not for the fact that - like the Beagle Boys in the famous cartoons, whom we call the 'Tank-busters' in German - a very different agenda is being pursued in the same place at the same time!
Unfortunately, in parallel to the Temporary Committee on Climate Change, climate policy is being pursued in the European Parliament's other committees as well: in the Committee on Industry, in the Committee on Environment and in the Committee on Development.
In these committees, our colleagues often arrive at very different outcomes; they do not conclude that we are at the dawn of a 'green' revolution, a second or third industrial revolution.
Let us take the controversy over the regulation of CO2 emissions from cars as just one example.
What is being put forward at present in this context by Mr Langen, the rapporteur for the Committee on Industry, has nothing to do with ambitious climate policy or the effort to guarantee energy security through efficiency technologies, which is what we are prescribing for the car industry in Europe.
The ambitious new dawn which is championed by Mr Dimas has been consistently blocked by various majorities in the European Parliament for the last one and a half years.
I would like to know what has happened to the spirit of the broader climate debate in this controversy over cars.
Here, it is not my Group that should put its hand on its heart; those who are applying the brakes here are distributed among all the other groups in this House.
Let me make one further point: emissions trading will be an important issue in Poznań and Copenhagen.
The Commission should ensure that we achieve a 20% reduction in Europe.
That was the proposal made by Angela Merkel when Germany held the Council Presidency, and yet as soon as the Commission tables its proposal for emissions trading, Members spring into action yet again as the parliamentary arm of the industry lobby in Europe, with the result that the negotiations focus not on achieving ambitious reduction targets but on achieving exemptions even before the rules have been established.
Mr Florenz's report is a good report.
The fact remains, however, that what we are voting on today has nothing to do with the reality of climate policy in the European Parliament.
<D>
- (PL) Madam President, it is sometimes said that Nazi totalitarianism originates from the Right and Communist totalitarianism from the Left.
This is not very precise.
Racial hatred and class hatred are only two varieties of the same thing - hatred - which devastates the human conscience and social relations.
We heard one such statement here a moment ago, the statement by Mr Pafilis.
Hatred gives birth to oppression, and oppression is the negation of a republic, a democracy and a country ruled by law.
Left and Right are both found in a democratic system.
Nazi and Communist totalitarianism destroyed democracy.
Therefore it was not the case that Nazism was on the Right, and Communism on the Left.
Nazism and Communism were all around.
Whoever today relativises the criminal character of totalitarianism, be it Nazi or Communist totalitarianism, stands in opposition to the traditions of a country ruled by law and to democracy.
It is, by the way, characteristic that while the European Right does not relativise Nazi crimes today, the European Left does relativise Communist crimes.
This is abundantly clear from the attitude of the socialists and Communists to the draft resolution on the matter which we have been negotiating today.
In this Chamber we are not voting on the truth about history, we are voting on the truth about ourselves, and about our moral judgments.
(Applause)
<D>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I wish to congratulate our rapporteur, Carlos Coelho, and the former French Presidency which, as expected, is not with us, for bringing about an agreement at first reading.
It required the will to do it plus the ability to accept the compromise required.
I have a special word of congratulation for Mr Coelho, our rapporteur, because his explanatory statement, which I invite my colleagues to read, is a little gem of intelligence and political skill.
Proper analysis of the text before us will reveal a major principle, which is also this report's revolutionary principle.
This revolutionary principle has nothing to do with biometric data.
That was decided in 2004.
The principle is that of 'one person-one passport'.
This raises the issue of children, and the age at which children's fingerprints can be taken.
Let us not hide the fact that the compromise was extremely difficult.
Some, like Mr Coelho at the outset, wanted this to be at the earliest possible age, to give children the earliest possible protection.
Yet this would require reliable biometric data, which at the moment cannot be guaranteed.
Finally, the following compromise has been achieved: children's fingerprints are obligatory from the age of 12.
Those States that collect them earlier may continue to do so for four years, but in no case will the age limit be less than six and the Commission will, in coming years, report on an assessment of the system as it is operating and, if need be, and this is included in the text, any modifications.
We must therefore hope for major progress in the technology, because the ideal for child protection would be to have reliable, comparable biometric data as soon as possible.
With this in mind, we can register our agreement with this text, which I again welcome, and I congratulate the rapporteur, the Commission for its initial proposal and the Council for its sense of compromise.
<D>
in writing. - (EL) The EU and its deeply unpopular Treaty cannot hide behind its demagogic claims to be more democratic and social.
Imperialist infighting has been temporarily covered up in order to launch an even greater onslaught on workers' rights and freedoms, and to stage an increase in monopoly profits.
The report on the Lisbon Treaty and the renamed European Constitution is a call for EC legislation to combat the opposition of workers in the Member States.
The alliance of EU political supporters, including the New Democracy and PASOK parties, do not want referendums because they are aware of the opposition of the workers who suffer barbarous capitalism and imperialist aggression.
The Lisbon Treaty and the European Constitution strengthen the EU so that it can operate more efficiently and benefit European monopolies.
As a result, the Lisbon Convention and the European Constitution:
strengthen the unpopular arming of the EU,
promote capitalist restructuring,
develop new policies for exploiting workers and infringing their social rights,
intensify the militarisation of the EU,
adopt the dogma of preventive war,
ratify imperialist interventions, even in Member States,
restrict the sovereign rights of Member States,
abolish the right of veto to the benefit of the stronger countries,
boost and create new mechanisms of repression,
further restrict individual rights and people's freedoms.
The workers of the EU have the power to condemn the European Treaty and the EU itself.
<D>
(PL) Mr President, Prime Minister, you referred to the European Union as a global player, especially once the Treaty has been ratified.
We can only support this view, and I would congratulate you, Prime Minister, on the clear and determined position you have taken vis-à-vis the Belarusian regime, Europe's last remaining dictatorship.
If we want to exercise influence in favour of democracy and the defence of human rights in Africa and Asia, we must first address those issues near at hand, on the Union's own doorstep.
In this context I would also congratulate you on the clear position taken with regard to enlargement of the EU.
Here I am thinking of Belarus's neighbour, Ukraine, where a great struggle is taking place over whether Ukraine will be a democracy and develop normally, swiftly and democratically, both to our benefit and to that of the Ukrainian nation.
Opening up to Ukraine is very important, with a view to its membership of the European Union.
Finally, I would congratulate you, Prime Minister, on your very strong statement concerning environmental protection of the Baltic, a small sea bordered by eight EU Member States.
The Baltic is practically an internal EU sea, and no sea in the world faces such a great environmental threat.
You also spoke of energy issues and action to counter climate change as the main priority of the Swedish Presidency.
We fully support this commitment, which is our civilisation's task and responsibility.
But I have the impression that, in this respect, we talk a lot and do little.
The mid-term budget review will take place during the Swedish Presidency.
Unless we change our budget so we can afford, with some degree of responsibility, to take action to combat climate change and to adapt to low-carbon technologies in the broad sense, we shall indeed go no further than words, and we shall fail to achieve our main priority.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - (EL) Mr President, I would like to thank the Chairman of the Committee on Petitions, Mr Libicki, for his report, which allows us to discuss the environmental impact of this large project, a natural gas pipeline of 1 200 km in length, which will be crossing a shallow sea such as the Baltic.
This is not just because this is an important project, raising many questions on environmental protection in the Baltic area, but also because this appears to be the first of many similar projects planned for the future.
The project has already attracted considerable attention from the media and from politicians throughout the Baltic region over the last few months.
It has been discussed at many forums and in many of the countries involved.
As Mr Libicki mentioned, it was also discussed in the European Parliament in January at a public hearing organised by the Committee on Petitions, in which I participated together with Mr Piebalgs, my fellow Commissioner, who is responsible for energy matters, .
Commissioner Piebalgs gave an overview of the prospects of the European Union with regard to natural gas and stressed that the needs of the European Union in gas are rapidly increasing, while the production of gas in the European Union is falling dramatically and stocks are being used up.
Our energy policy for Europe highlights the urgent need to promote an improvement in energy efficiency and renewable energy sources, and we are working towards that goal.
Significant increases in natural gas imports will, however, still be needed to cover Europe's energy requirements in coming decades.
Additional infrastructure, such as natural gas pipelines and liquefied natural gas terminals, will play a significant role in meeting the needs of European consumers and in ensuring a constant supply.
The Nord Stream pipeline will make it possible to increase the supply of natural gas from Russia.
As you know, the need to construct new infrastructure for the transportation of Russian gas to the European Union has been acknowledged by the European Parliament and by the Council through the guidelines for trans-European energy networks, adopted in September 2006.
I am specifically referring to Decision No 1364/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council.
The guidelines specified certain priority projects and this project is classified as a project of European interest and, therefore, as a top priority.
Provided that the environmental impact study reaches positive conclusions, the Nord Stream pipeline will be a project of European interest.
My main point during the European Parliament hearing in January was that the project, just like any other project, must follow all the relevant environmental rules of international and Community law during its construction, operation and monitoring stages.
This is also the point I wish to make today.
According to international and Community law, then, the project owner, namely Nord Stream AG, must apply for an implementation permit or for a construction permit from the countries which have jurisdiction over the works to be carried out, these countries being Germany, Denmark, Finland and Sweden.
The grant of an implementation permit for such projects is, however, subject to the environmental impact assessment procedure.
This is also stipulated in the guidelines for trans-European energy networks I mentioned earlier.
The environmental impact assessment procedures are laid down both in Community and in international law.
There is a relevant EU directive, as well as the Espoo Convention at cross-border level.
The Espoo Convention is part of Community acquis, given that both the Community and the Member States are parties to the Convention.
In this case, the procedures of both Community and national law apply.
The project's cross-border nature means that the Espoo Convention must be adhered to, while the Member States involved must properly enforce the provisions of the directive on environmental impact assessments before granting an implementation permit.
The environmental impact procedure based on the Espoo Convention started with the project's disclosure in late 2006.
According to the information held by the Commission, numerous studies, reports and matters have been discussed at various forums and meetings, both with the public and with the competent authorities in various Member States.
As is stipulated in the Espoo Convention, the contractor or project owner must provide the appropriate documentation regarding the environmental impact.
At the same time, the country with the authority to issue the implementation permit, the country of origin, the party of origin as it is referred to in the Espoo Convention, has the following two duties.
Firstly, it must hold talks with the environmental authorities and with the public affected and, secondly, it must initiate talks with the affected party or parties, meaning the neighbouring countries, which may be subject to the project's cross-border impact.
In this case, the affected parties are the three Baltic States and Poland.
Therefore, due compliance with the environmental impact procedure means that all the concerns, questions and important issues, such as those mentioned in the report we are discussing today, must be evaluated and discussed both by the competent authorities and by the public.
At the present phase, any emphasis placed on a potential negative environmental impact which cannot be mitigated or avoided, as laid down in the environmental impact legislation, is premature.
In fact, the final environmental impact assessment report has not yet been drafted.
Therefore, the environmental authorities have not yet had the chance to analyse and evaluate all the technical data necessary for providing answers to all the legitimate questions.
The countries of origin have a legal right to demand all the supplementary information which they deem to be necessary in order for them to be able to grant, if they so decide, an implementation permit; for instance, Sweden has already done so, when the project owner submitted a formal request in order to comply with the national legal requirements.
On the other hand, the affected parties also have a legal right to ensure that they hold all the information necessary to meet their needs.
I have been informed that all the parties involved, meaning both the parties of origin and the affected parties, are regularly holding meetings and discussions on the developments in the environmental impact procedure based on the Espoo Convention.
The final environmental impact report is expected by the end of the year.
After it has been submitted, the formal talks will take place, and these will determine the final decision on whether or not an implementation permit is granted.
I expect that the competent authorities in all the Member States, which are parties to the Espoo Convention, will perform their duties and assume their responsibilities as they ought to.
Russia, which has signed the Espoo Convention but is not a party to it, has nonetheless agreed to abide to its rules.
In conclusion, I wish to stress that we are monitoring developments and that we are in contact with the responsible parties of the Espoo Convention, with the parties involved and with the contractor.
With regard to the contractor, the Commission authorities have made it clear that all the obligations pertaining to the necessary information and to the transparency required must be honoured.
(Applause)
<D>
(DE) Mr President, transport, and above all road transport, is responsible for 30% of CO2 emissions, and even with this directive we are still miles away from achieving fair competition between the different modes of transport.
The EU has had a mandatory rail toll since the mid-1990s.
It applies to every locomotive on every kilometre of track, and it is practically unlimited in size.
On the roads, it is left up to the Member States to decide whether they charge any toll at all.
It applies only to goods vehicles, only on motorways and only to goods vehicles weighing 12 tonnes or more.
That is unfair competition.
It leads to the traffic moving from the railways to the roads rather than, as your fine grandiose speeches often indicate, from the roads to the railways.
The rail toll in Slovakia is twice as high as in Germany, and the Slovaks have no road tolls at all.
That is just madness.
That is why we need this directive.
We need the true reflection of costs.
If Members from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats believe that the costs of congestion should not be included, they should at least vote for the inclusion of the climate costs, the accident costs and the noise costs.
Then they will be credible.
Those who vote 'no' on this issue are giving up on climate change and setting our children and our children's children on the road to ruin, as they will have no future on this planet.
We need regulation that is much tougher than what the Commission and the majority of this House have proposed.
<D>
(DE) Madam President, Mr Piebalgs, Mrs Reding, ladies and gentlemen, we need investment now.
We are on the verge of an energy crisis and a financial crisis.
We need to make an effort to invest as quickly and as well as possible, and therefore we cannot but say 'yes' to the construction not only of pipelines but also of LNG ships.
We should build them as quickly as possible, as this would create jobs and thus contribute to full employment in Europe.
The pipelines should not compete with each other; rather, the construction of each new pipeline is a win-win situation, as is the construction of LNG terminals.
This is an important issue for the future.
Above all, we need to invest in energy efficiency, not via state funding, but rather by means of tax breaks.
If we could give every citizen an allowance of EUR 10 000 a year that they could offset against tax, we could make an immediate start on investing in energy efficiency and renewable energy; with regard to the latter, progressive depreciation, in other words the immediate inclusion of costs on the balance sheet, would be a particularly valuable tool.
If we could set a three-year limit for this, it would be a great success for all of us.
We could get a better handle on employment and energy.
In this connection, it is up to Commissioner Kovács to launch an initiative.
One point which particularly exercises us in this programme is, quite naturally, the nuclear industry: it is vital to ensure the safety and security of nuclear power stations, and to do so to the very best of our ability.
It is not possible to set the bar too high here: quite simply, we need people to trust in the European Union that the appropriate steps will be taken, that further security research will be conducted and that there will be legally binding requirements allowing dangerous nuclear power stations to be removed from the grid immediately following a ruling by a court or regulator.
The people of Europe have a right to safety in this field, so that we can go forward into a future in which energy generation does not put us in danger and we can sleep soundly.
The Commission can make a significant contribution to this.
Ultimately, however, it will also be up to the Council, in the group responsible for nuclear safety, to live up to their responsibilities and not to go down a path that the citizens will not appreciate, by blocking proposals from the European Parliament and the Commission.
<D>
in writing. - (SV) We believe that the original purpose of the programme - to distribute intervention stocks to the most deprived persons - was strangely worded right from the start.
Mixing agricultural policy with social policy may be commendable, but it gets complicated.
Recently, the proportion of goods not coming from intervention stocks has steadily increased.
At the last reckoning, around 85% of the food was bought on the open market.
We believe that the distribution of food to the most deprived persons in the Community should be abolished.
The circumstances of the most deprived persons in the Member States should be dealt with by the Member States or the municipalities.
It is these political levels of responsibility which should ensure, via their social policy, that all citizens get their right to a minimum level of subsistence.
Whether this is done via social security benefits, the distribution of food or by other means should be their decision.
The European Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development proposes that the food aid be funded in full by the EU.
The views that are put forward in this committee simply to get agricultural products on the market are astounding.
As usual, the June List observes that, in this situation, it is fortunate that the European Parliament does not have powers of codecision in respect of the EU's agricultural policy.
Otherwise, the EU would fall into the trap of protectionism and of heavy subsidies to various groups within agriculture.
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteur, because I believe that together we have produced a very good resolution.
This resolution calls on the Council and the Commission to ensure that joint action is taken in Kosovo, that EULEX acts together with the High Representative of the EU and that synergies are created in the interest of the economic and social life of Kosovo which is in need of improvement.
The EULEX mission must also ensure that the court cases which have been going on there for years are finally addressed and brought to an end.
There are still many atrocities which have not yet been exposed and brought before a court.
Combating corruption in Kosovo is also important, as there are still many criminals at large who remain unpunished.
In addition to what we have already heard, the European Union should consider not only taking action on a large scale, but also focusing more closely on the daily life of the people there and the opportunities for local projects involving local people.
This work is very important.
We must call on the government of Kosovo finally to begin the practical implementation of its constitution, which includes the Martti Ahtisaari plan.
The people of Kosovo must become aware in their everyday lives that they all live together.
In addition, Serbs, Albanians and all the other minorities in Kosovo must be regarded as citizens with equal rights.
The government of Kosovo must also push ahead with its decentralisation programme.
I am, of course, very much in favour of establishing a multi-ethnic European college, which would be another joint institution alongside the University of Priština and the University of Mitrovica that focuses on a shared future.
In addition, I would like Serbia to realise at last that the Serbs in Kosovo do not want to be encouraged not to take part in the government.
They must be allowed to take part in the government, in parliamentary work and in civilian life.
This is the only way in which Kosovo will flourish.
<D>
(PL) Mr President, the recommendation on the conclusion of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and the Republic of Montenegro concerns a special situation.
For the first time we have to deal with a country that achieved independence through a referendum.
I was an observer at the first parliamentary election held in Montenegro after the referendum, as a representative of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.
Both the Council of Europe delegation and the OECD confirmed the democratic nature of the election.
I was fascinated by the degree of civic involvement in the observation of the election process.
Representatives of non-governmental organisations, returning officers, were present in all the electoral committees we visited.
The great commitment of the members of the electoral committees in ensuring that all procedures were complied with was clear to see.
It should also be noted that Montenegro has adopted the euro as legal tender.
Having regard to the progress made towards integration in the European Union, I support the recommendation on the conclusion of the Agreement.
It is my hope that the adaptation process will help Montenegro improve the living conditions of its inhabitants.
(The President cut off the speaker)
<D>
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what has just been said demonstrates that your proposal was at the very least controversial.
At the start, however there was no debate to be had.
The Commission had launched an independent study and a public consultation, both of which indicated that there was a broad consensus on the efficiency and stability of the current system.
The only improvements sought by the various parties involved were for greater transparency, greater speed and better access for SMEs.
However, masking this reality, the Commission introduced a reform that will go down in history for the general opposition that it has created.
Trade unions and businesses alike, along with most of the members of the Council, protested against a plan that threatened the Union's capacity to defend itself against unfair trading practices.
The Commission has withdrawn its proposal and I am very pleased about that.
The approach that it favoured was in fact dangerous and had sown seeds of division.
It is worth pointing out that the Commission's role is to ensure solidarity between Member States and to respect the various interests that exist, not to be divisive by playing consumers against workers, or importers against producers.
Commissioner, may I remind you that any project for reform requires two things: it has to take account of the recommendations and results of its own investigations and it has to inform the Members of this House in advance of the precise direction the proposal is to take, especially when it comes to its more controversial aspects.
<D>
Articles 84 and 96 of the report deal with the human rights situation in Cuba.
It must be said that, despite international pressure, systematic intimidation, interrogation and sophisticated forms of violence have continued against the Women in White even in 2008.
Several weeks ago the regime attempted in all manner of ways to prevent them from mounting a silent protest on the sixth anniversary of their husbands' imprisonment.
As a mark of support, a solidarity march for the Women in White and their husbands was held in Bratislava on 28 April 2009.
Of the 75 activists imprisoned six years ago, whose cause has been backed by organisations including the EU, 54 remain behind bars.
Only if we monitor their plight will we succeed in getting them out of prison before they are reduced to human wrecks.
Let us not forget that we will soon be commemorating the 20th anniversary of the fall of communism in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
What we can do for the Cuban prisoners and their wives now is to leave the paragraphs on human rights' violations in Cuba in the text of the report.
I feel I have to mention Amendment 2, which sharply criticises Pope Benedict XVI.
This amendment maligns the head of the Catholic Church.
Besides that, it places his statements on the same level as crimes committed in countries where the death penalty is abused, where people are tortured and killed for expressing their opinions and where there is no respect for the most basic human rights.
Let us reject this amendment.
<D>
(PL) Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating my fellow Member Mr Goepel on a fine report and by thanking him for the enormous amount of work he has invested in it.
The report fully reflects Parliament's particular interest in the issue of agricultural policy.
Even though expenditure in the current budget perspective amounts to only 33%, compared to 80% in the 1970s, agricultural policy continues to be, and should be, one of the most important European policies.
Since my time is limited, I shall mention just a few matters that are of importance to the new Member States.
The introduction of modulation in the new Member States should not be accepted until full payments have been obtained and should be done gradually, as it was in other countries of the Fifteen.
I cannot agree with removal of the subsidies and energy supplements that we have only just been awarded.
Quite the contrary, the EU should particularly support the new direction of biomass production.
As regards the future of milk quotas, I am holding to my belief that the decision to be taken on this requires a broader debate and much more profound analysis.
<D>
in writing. - (GA) I wholeheartedly welcome this excellent report from Mr Beaupuy on Governance and Partnership.
It is unfortunate that the partnership principle is not always adhered to in the spending of structural funds.
Nevertheless, I have witnessed very good examples in Northern Ireland of how partnership should work and I have seen the benefits of partnership when done correctly.
I also welcome the calls in this report for closer cooperation and contact between local and regional authorities and other levels of governance, especially with the European Commission.
The Northern Ireland Assembly must build on the links already established by the European Commission.
This is especially true for work of the Task-force which was created by the President of the European Commission, Mr Barroso.
The Northern Ireland Assembly and our local communities are prepared to play a greater role in the implementing of EU programmes at community level.
This report sets out how they may be empowered to do so.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, transatlantic trade is currently worth about EUR 600 billion a year.
Now the Commission is suggesting that we open the market to poultry that has been disinfected in a chlorine solution.
I say strongly: I greatly regret that the Commission has not managed to claim - and gain - access to the market in the United States for our unchlorinated poultry at last.
However, I would like to say that I support the Commission's suggestions in principle, because the scientific experts' reports are conclusive.
The European Food Safety Authority provided a very conclusive expert report; we do not require any further expert reports.
Here, as on the other side of the Atlantic, nobody wishes to see people's health put at risk by food, but if there really are misgivings about the substances used in the United States, then I ask myself why these substances are permitted here in the European Union as an additive to animal feedstuffs, potable water and other foods?
I know how much importance many EU Member States attach to food quality and food safety, and just as well.
What would France be, for example, without its coq au vin?
This product, exported from France and famous the world over, is also prepared for export to the United States with a chlorine treatment according to the American method.
Apparently, this method is so good that it is considered suitable for the export of quality products from Europe.
From my point of view, then, this is a rather dishonest discussion.
The Commission has made clear suggestions to guarantee the safety of European consumers.
I believe that labelling, in particular, must be clear and visible, so that consumers really know what they are buying, but I know, too, that consumers will choose European poultry anyway.
However, I call on everyone to stop hiding behind supposed environmental or health arguments and clearly state what this is really about.
It is a question of honesty and honesty in politics is vital, especially when it comes to discussing a topic with friends like the United States.
<D>
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, transparency is necessary in agriculture.
Mr Deß said that money is going into shady projects.
It is true that we want to expose this, too, through such transparency, but perhaps he will also agree with me that not much money is finding its way into European agriculture and Europe's rural areas; some of it is flowing into the wrong channels.
Billions of euro have been earmarked for farmers in the budgets of past years but have failed to reach farmers.
All the export subsidies in favour of farmers, the EU's whole practice of intervention involving storage - these have swallowed up billions of euro but have not helped farmers.
At best - as Mrs Harkin from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe said - it has kept prices down by means of downward stabilisation of the market, which is a kind of brake on inflation.
Naturally, it is the general aim to keep prices stable, but it cannot be in the interests of farmers to be the nation's or Europe's lackey in order to ensure this.
The rapporteur was right when he talked of the need for a frame of reference: publication alone is not enough.
I should like to give a frame of reference: even after the reform of the CAP, at a rate of EUR 300 per hectare, a rationalised business where one worker takes care of 400 hectares - that is, the highest level of rationalisation - receives approximately EUR 120 000 per worker.
80% of farmers do not even receive a tenth of this.
Therefore, we also need to explain what happens to this money.
This frame of reference must be created by politicians - it will not automatically come with publication.
When the Commission states in its proposal that these payments may have to be graduated, that modulation into the second pillar must be introduced - as here the funds produce better results in terms of workers, the environment - then this is a foretaste of what lies ahead, namely the discussion following the publication of this information.
And then we shall have to give politics free rein once more.
However, the figures must first be allowed to speak, they must be published, and we must be patient, and if they prove incorrect, the policy will have to be changed so as to put them right.
Many thanks for your report - we shall be supporting it.
<D>
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (PL) I would like to concentrate for a moment on the link between human rights and democracy.
It is generally felt that these rights can be fully observed only in a democracy.
Democracy is in turn identified with majority governments that come into being through an election mechanism.
This was Greek democracy, where the majority decided on everything.
Through this system of majority voting, though, Socrates was condemned to death.
Therefore, the will of the majority cannot always serve as a guarantee of citizens' rights.
This is why in the 19th century a fear arose in political thought - one that is poorly understood today - a fear of extending voting rights to broader social groups, which is linked to the assumption that only an enlightened minority is in a position to respect human rights and freedoms.
Today we often run up against situations in which quite respectable elections lead to dictatorial governments, or support such governments.
Just think of countries like Belarus, or the Hamas governments in the Gaza Strip.
It is also worth recalling the famous response by President Mubarak of Egypt, who, when called upon to hold fair elections, said that they would result in governments in Egypt being taken over by radical fundamentalist Islamic groups.
Clearly elections are something of untold value, and that is why they also need monitoring.
Who knows, however, whether a rule-of-law government and a genuinely independent judiciary might not be more important than elections in many countries these days.
Otherwise we could have a democracy that is no more than a dictatorship propped up by an election mandate - a dictatorship in which there are no independent institutions to create a complex system of balances and securities to protect citizens from arbitrary action by the authorities.
Democracy must be liberal democracy, not dictatorship by the majority.
We should therefore maintain the practice of observing elections, but we must not limit ourselves to such actions in the fight to establish an authentic liberal democracy.
This means that more attention needs to be devoted to establishing a democratic culture and the institutions of a civil society.
Such actions cannot count on support from autocratic authorities.
Better assistance mechanisms therefore need to be developed, mechanisms that are even more flexible than those we already have, and the scope of our support must be broadened by providing assistance to those courageous individuals who are subjected to various repressions on account of their activities.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - The Commission is undertaking measures at different levels aimed at reducing increases in food prices.
One initiative is to begin monitoring prices, which I mentioned earlier.
This is one of the objectives of the consumer market scoreboard on which we are working and which I believe will be supported by the Commission pretty soon.
The Commission has also proposed a number of measures within the framework of agricultural policy.
A reduction of obligatory set-aside land, already in force for the 2008 crop season; an increase in milk quotas for the year 2008-2009 adopted by the Commission and proposed to the Council, if adopted, will be in force from 1 April 2008 onwards, and a reduction of import duties in the cereals sector to reduce increases in cereal prices and also in the future of the price of meat.
This measure came into force from the beginning of January 2008.
This is a kind of inventory of what we have done.
But, through the consumer market scoreboard, one of the main topics of our investigations will be prices and part of this basket will be about food prices.
So we will duly inform you; we will consult as to what the next step will be after the data monitoring and we can take action to see what is behind this - of course, hand in hand with the national authorities.
<D>
Mr President, Turkey is an important country for political, economic, military and cultural reasons, and it is therefore important to the EU.
Realising this, the EU has decided to commence accession negotiations.
The path towards accession has not been very smooth, but it has helped initiate a much-needed democratic reform programme in Turkey.
Such reforms are welcomed both by the EU and by the citizens of Turkey.
Those reforms must continue, and for that reason, at least, our support for Turkish accession must be firm.
Nobody is ignoring the fact that problems exist.
My country, Cyprus, is at the centre of one such problem, but I, like most people in this Chamber, realise that problems are not solved by conflict, but by peaceful negotiation.
A more European Turkey is much better for discussing and solving problems with, and hence I fully support Turkey's accession to the EU.
Consequently, I endorse the compromise reached through the wise handling afforded by Ms Oomen-Ruijten, with the honest and fruitful cooperation of all those interested colleagues, who may have differing opinions on certain specific issues, but who all agree on the principle that the EU can achieve more by cooperating constructively with the Turkish people than by destructively antagonising them.
Turkey is undergoing a difficult period right now, and the use by the EU of more carrot and less stick is presently the appropriate way to proceed.
Let our overwhelming support for this report be proof to the Turkish people that we do want them in the EU, and let it be a help for greater and faster reforms in Turkey and for enhanced facilitation of solving the far too longstanding Cyprus problem.
<D>
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. - (DE) Mr President, the financial ceiling for heading 4 is EUR 7.002 billion according to the multi-annual financial framework.
The Council increased the Commission's 2008 preliminary draft budget of EUR 6.672 billion to EUR 6.89 billion, mainly by adding additional amounts for Palestine and Kosovo.
Parliament pointed out at an early stage that these funds could not be adequate because challenges that could already be foreseen had not been taken into account.
Now we hear from the Council that much higher amounts are required, particularly in the area of security policy.
Unfortunately, we are still not aware of any concrete proposals.
We must, however, come to an agreement with the Council as regards CFSP.
Let us therefore negotiate openly and honestly on the actual needs for 2008.
If we have approved some EUR 250 million a year for the CFSP from 2007 to 2013, the shortfall in funding will already be apparent.
Our costs for security policy are running almost according to the time frame.
Another important subject is Palestine.
In 2007 we are spending significantly more than estimated, up to EUR 400 million.
We also need more money next year than the Commission and the Council have so far estimated.
We cannot expect Parliament to introduce lower amounts into the budget, however, and to subsequently plunder other policies in the course of the year because there has been no serious planning.
Nor is there yet any clarity regarding the precise allocation of the tasks relating to Kosovo and the budgetary needs for 2008.
I know we will first have to wait for the exact mandate here.
In conclusion, I should like to point to the political dialogue we shortly need to establish.
The European Parliament has been fighting for this in negotiations on the multi-annual financial framework and to have it anchored in the Interinstitutional Agreement.
This would be the right forum to tackle major developments in a constructive manner, in good time and on the basis of mutual trust.
This would be the right context for preparing a review of the new financial instruments.
<D>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in accordance with Article 170(4), I request on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats that the final vote on the resolution and the report be postponed until the next plenary sitting.
It became clear in the debate yesterday that the majority in Parliament would be able to agree to the signing of the interim agreement, even if it pains them to do so.
Many Members are hoping that, after years of deadlock, the agreement will enable a new quality of dialogue between the European Union and Turkmenistan.
However, for the majority of Members it is important that we do not give the Commission and the Council a free ride.
As Parliament, we need guarantees from the Commission and the Council that, if the human rights situation continues to worsen, at the request of Parliament serious consideration will be given to the suspension of the agreement.
Yesterday, the Commission unfortunately only conditionally agreed and the Council did not agree at all to this demand.
I therefore request, on behalf of my Group, that both final votes be postponed until we have the corresponding commitments from the Council and the Commission.
(Applause)
<D>
A week ago, the UN General Assembly authorised the EU to speak with one voice at its meetings.
From now on, high-level representatives will be able to convey the Union's message in the highest international body.
This provision is a significant step forward in the implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon, but it is not enough.
The EU needs a real strategy so that it can actually apply the powers conferred on it by the Treaty of Lisbon.
Be it in the Security Council, the Human Rights Council, NATO, the WTO or the G20, the EU should no longer have to hide in the shadows.
What is more, we should take the lead in establishing a global parliamentary system.
High-level diplomacy is obviously needed, but it must be carried out in consultation with the people.
And how better to achieve that than to enable citizens from the world over to be represented at the UN?
There is the European Parliament, but there are also regional parliaments, such as the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly.
What we need today is a world parliament.
Baroness Ashton, the European Union must be ambitious.
I hope that this proposal will appear in your White Paper.
<D>
(PL) Mr President, the European Union places great value on the proper treatment of animals during the entire period of breeding, from birth to the slaughterhouse.
As we know, the quality of the meat depends on the way the animals are treated during breeding and during transport.
Animal protection standards during transport need to be established for specific animal species, on the basis of scientific evidence.
We therefore need to review this Regulation.
Due to trade needs, animals are transported over specified distances which are often too long, and which require a significant amount of time to cover.
It is therefore important to respect prescribed principles and standards.
That is why the question regarding how, and whether, EU legislation on the transport of animals is implemented, was entirely justified.
We should assess the situation in specific Member States.
We should remember that this all has an impact on costs and on productive competitiveness.
The citizens of the European Union are very sensitive....
(The President cut off the speaker)
<D>
(PL) Mr President, we are all fully aware that the European Union's car industry is one of the most important sectors of its economy, producing 19 million vehicles a year.
Most importantly, it also accounts for 2.3 million jobs.
A further 10 million jobs in associated sectors are indirectly dependent on this industry.
It is worth noting that it is not only the quantity but probably essentially the quality of the jobs provided that accounts for the key role the car industry plays in the economic life of the European Union.
The best way of illustrating this success is by reference to the EUR 35 billion annual export trade surplus and the high level of innovation.
Despite all this optimistic data, the European car industry is facing some very serious challenges.
I fully support the final report of the CARS 21 High Level Group and the European Commission's communication on the subject.
Nonetheless, I should like to call for further action aimed at creating a genuine single internal market in cars.
Individual Member States are still applying different tax regimes concerning cars, either by charging duty or through other registration charges, perpetuating the inequalities between consumers.
I welcomed the compromise achieved in the European Parliament concerning the so-called 'repair clause', because it most certainly represents a step towards unifying provisions in this area, thus contributing to better law-making.
The car industry should be relieved of unnecessary bureaucratic burdens, especially as regards increasing the number of international provisions already in existence.
Pursuant to the principles of better law-making, a proper impact assessment and the principle of optimising costs and benefits should always be taken into account when creating a competitive legal environment for the car industry.
In view of the ongoing technological development in this sector, I support the Commission's action introducing a review and revision mechanism to ensure that legal provisions do not slow down the technical advances that are constantly being achieved.
The European car industry is one of the most competitive of its kind in the world.
Nonetheless, its position may be threatened if its competitors resort to unfair trading practices or fail to respect intellectual property rights.
I should like to call on the Commission to take more consistent and effective action to ensure respect for intellectual property rights and their implementation in all parts of the world, notably China.
The importance of the strategic partnership with China is beyond dispute, but European intellectual property has to be protected.
This is absolutely vital.
<D>
in writing. - It is appropriate that we will vote on a report on tourism on 6 April, which is known as Tartan Day.
Tartan Day is a day of celebration where Scotland reaches out to our diaspora in North America and encourages our North American friends to come and visit us.
It falls on the anniversary of the signing of Scotland's independence declaration, the Declaration of Arbroath.
That centuries-old document sums up well the principles upon which all my work here is guided: 'It is in truth not for glory, nor riches, nor honours that we are fighting, but for freedom - for that alone, which no honest man gives up but with life itself'.
ints, and the seasonal distribution of tourist movements, which need to be addressed at both European Union and Member State levels.
It is important to draw attention to the fact that tourism is a major economic activity with a broadly positive impact on economic growth and employment in Europe.
Consequently, it is necessary to update and optimise the legal framework for European statistics on tourism, and we should strengthen the EU tourism sector through specific proposals and initiatives that would complement Member State programmes.
Tourism is also an increasingly important aspect in the lives of European citizens, more and more of whom are travelling, either for leisure or business.
Furthermore, this sector impinges on cultural and natural heritage and on traditions and contemporary cultures in the European Union.
Consequently, it is important to define a new framework for action to increase its competitiveness and its capacity for sustainable growth.
<D>
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, tomorrow, on the last day that this composition of the House meets, we will be taking a vote on a package of proposals for improving our asylum policy.
After five years of debating and visiting asylum centres, it is high time that we came up with concrete measures.
If, after all of this, we are made to wait any longer for implementation, the final reaction will have come really rather too late.
Because of the events of 2005 and 2006, we have had to tackle illegal immigration, but in that process the asylum-seeker has literally fallen overboard.
Although I am in favour of establishing an agency for cooperation, I do have some concerns about its form and mission.
How do we get a reliable list of safe countries of origin?
What sources are we going to use to produce such a list?
How can we provide adequate protection for the sources of information that come from those countries which are not safe?
Can such sources be publicly disclosed and how credible will such a list be to an independent judge?
I should like to hear from the Council how we might avoid this problem.
Why is it that we have not delegated practical cooperation to Frontex?
This agency's remit is limited and it would be very well-placed to tackle this task, if we increased its funding.
That way, we would also be able to respond adequately to the actual facts on the ground, which Frontex is already facing, anyway.
Based on our experience of asylum-seekers' and immigrants' illegal entry, we could then make proper arrangements for providing reception for asylum-seekers.
To me, that seems a very practical solution.
<D>
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have welcomed the work done during this period in which Mrs Ashton has been carrying out her role as Commissioner.
I must say that we have had a better relationship with her than we had with her predecessor, despite their common political affiliation, which we too share, and their common nationality.
However, this time I do not share the Commissioner's enthusiasm on this issue, because too often in recent years, the Commission has taken the floor here and talked up certain initiatives, only to then pursue a different path.
We are going through a particular moment in time, a major economic and financial crisis, which is also the result of a lack of reciprocity in the world, not only with developing countries - which has its own logic, its own explanation - but with the new global players and the traditional global players.
Too often I seem to sense a lack of awareness within the Commission, by its President and its Commissioners, of which initiatives should be implemented to aid the recovery of European industry, the recovery of the European manufacturing industry.
It seems to me that this agreement - which, admittedly, is a positive agreement and has extremely positive content - has more of an academic value; it is almost a textbook treaty, but one that is not in touch with reality.
We export USD 30 billion to Korea, only USD 20 billion come back in the form of cars exported from Korea to Europe, and USD 1.5 billion will be the indirect aid that accrues to Korean cars in Europe, without mentioning the textile and other sectors.
That is a definite imbalance, which I believe must be highlighted and must be corrected, before the green light is given to a free trade agreement that penalises European industry.
Ours is a quality industry that has committed itself to the new requirements that innovation calls for, certainly not a bankrupt industry that cannot get to grips with the need for innovation that exists within the economy.
<D>
(SV) Mr President, it is important is that we be clear about what we want.
For too long a discussion which should be dealing with human rights has been poisoned by various political considerations.
It goes without saying that a woman has a right to her own body.
This is why I did not dodge the question, in the debate on genital mutilation, whether the application of Sharia law amounts to not recognising the equal value of human beings.
No one would think of refusing a man the right to decide on his own reproduction or say that it was a question of cultural values to refuse a man the possibility of earning his own money and maintaining his own independence.
When the EU, which is the world's biggest aid provider, acts in the Third World, our values must always be clear.
Human rights - by which I understand equality not just in theory but also in practice - must be the watchword.
We must make it clearly understood that the market economy is good for poor women and men, not bad.
That is demonstrated not least by the successful campaign for micro-credit, which has created both prosperity and empowerment for millions of vulnerable women.
Of course, it is not for us in the rich world to force a particular way of life on other people, but we have, as I think it is important to point out, a responsibility to render possible choices where there are no choices today.
Like many of my colleagues here, therefore, I am truly disappointed to see some of the amendments tabled to an otherwise good and important report.
They really do point in the wrong direction.
To my colleague behind me, I would like to say that, when I was a Member of the Swedish Parliament, I stayed home with my son for six months on paternity leave.
I think that I actually became a better parent than I had been before.
Certainly, I read the papers, but my main responsibility was to look after my children and to do it together with my wife.
I can only say that it is a good thing.
I think more people should do it and see how important it is to keep a family together: man, woman, children.
(Applause)
<D>
(NL) Mr President, the joint motion for a resolution which we adopted today contains many points that are worthy of promotion.
For example, I agree with the fact that the sacrifices that very many people have made in the fight against totalitarian regimes of the 21st century in Europe should not be forgotten.
I should nevertheless like to make a few comments.
It is regrettable that there is no mention of the allies of these totalitarian regimes who, until very recently, held nearly the whole of Eastern Europe in their grip.
It is true that so-called right-wing politicians have made precious few efforts to demand democratisation in Eastern Europe, but it is even truer that very many left-wing politicians actively supported these Communist regimes, even though they play the holy innocent today, even in this Parliament.
Secondly, we should really have the courage, with this report, to take a stand against the muzzling laws.
Historical research, however difficult, should be carried out in a delicate way, with due respect for the victims, but in complete freedom.
It is unfortunate that we have let both these opportunities slip.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - (CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission welcomes this own-initiative report on the principle of equal pay for men and women and I congratulate the rapporteur on the quality of her work.
The Commission, like Parliament, considers the 15% pay gap between women and men in Europe today to be unacceptable.
We must of course be careful and not lose sight of the fact that this indicator compares relative differences in the gross hourly earnings of women and men across the economy as a whole.
It does not therefore measure just direct discrimination but is an indicator of all of the related factors and all of the disadvantages which women suffer from before they enter the labour market and over the entire course of their professional careers.
The Commission Communication of July 2007 stated that Community laws were effective in eliminating direct discrimination - in other words in cases where the remuneration for the same work is lower for women than for their male colleagues.
They were, however, less effective in ensuring adherence to the principle of equal pay for work of equal value.
Based on a detailed analysis the Commission has concluded that it should be possible to consider amending Community law with the aim of ensuring above all that the systems for setting pay rates exclude both direct and indirect gender-based discrimination.
The Commission announced that in 2008 it would be evaluating Community laws from the standpoint of their implications in respect of the pay gap and that it would be proposing necessary amendments.
The detailed analysis mentioned earlier is currently under way and I cannot predict what the results will be.
In order to ensure quality, the Commission is making use of external specialist consultants as well as the extensive and detailed expertise and knowledge of intra-state bodies concerned with gender equality.
The preliminary results of this study will be discussed at a workshop in the first quarter of 2009, when all the interested parties should attend, including Member States, legal experts, intra-state bodies concerned with gender equality, social partners and civil society.
Parliament's attitude in this process will be decisive.
It is significant that one of the participating law creating bodies has expressed a clear opinion that the laws in question must be amended quickly.
It is also important that the practical recommendations of Parliament regarding the amendments relate to the areas which the main interested parties have identified as problematic, among them are transparency of remuneration and work assessments and sanctions.
In conclusion: we share Parliament's view that such a great difference in pay for women and men in Europe is unacceptable.
The Commission considers that this is the right time to complete the analysis and the assessment and to plan the next steps, which will lead to more concrete results.

in writing. - (PT) Since the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the common European policies on migration and asylum have been constantly developing.
In this context, it is vital that we can rely on objective, reliable and comparable information and data at national and European level so that we can better understand and analyse the migration phenomena and draw up policies or take decisions based on better information.
However, the existing data is disparate and in many cases is not reliable, comparable or even up to date.
The Thessaloniki European Council approved the establishment of a European Migration Network, which started to operate as a pilot project and was then followed by a preparatory action.
I therefore support this proposal, which aims to consolidate the existing structure, making it permanent and giving it an appropriate legal basis by defining its objectives, functions, structure and methods of financing.
I agree with the amendments proposed by the rapporteur, in particular the inclusion of asylum in the Network's name and the extension of its mandate.
I particularly agree that the Council's proposal to only give Parliament a role as observer, without any right to vote, is unacceptable.
<D>
Mr President, can I suggest that this is a very depressing debate, although it is based on a very factual and thorough report, for which I congratulate the rapporteur.
Maybe it is on too late at night because one could get nightmares based on the demographic trends that are contained in it.
Certainly if we do nothing, the forebodings contained in the report may yet come to pass, although some Member States are reacting and putting in place measures to support men, women and children and that is positive.
Ironically, I grew up in an era where they told us we had too many children, and being one of a family of eight was probably large in the European context, although I am happy to say that my mother, at 85, is still alive and well.
The simple truth is that women cannot do it all.
We cannot have children, hold onto a job outside the home, mind elderly parents and participate in wider society.
Something has to give.
I think the problem is that the birth rate is the issue that has given, if you like, in all of this.
But, ironically, I have great faith in humanity, realising the reality of where we are at and adjusting to a more balanced look at what is needed for a vibrant society and again placing a greater value on children.
Perhaps this debate tonight will add to that.
<D>
(ES) Madam President, the recent financial crises have shown the importance of high-quality accounting standards for the proper functioning of the markets.
This being the case, it seems to me that another lesson of the crisis is that there is a certain asymmetry between the stated importance of accounting standards and the nature and operation of the private entities responsible for setting, producing and interpreting those standards.
Mr Radwan's report is therefore correct to point out that the first matter to be dealt with is that of governance.
In my view he has put forward intelligent and realistic proposals about the need for the institutions representing the Union to be more proactive in this process of setting standards which are to be incorporated into the Community legal order, also concerning the internal operating rules of those private entities.
Greater transparency, safeguards to prevent conflicts of interest and broader geographical representation are some of the proposals which Mr Radwan has put forward.
The second aspect dealt with in the report is the matter of small and medium-sized undertakings.
We have emphasised here in the House the need to reconcile two objectives: simplification and reduced cost of accounting procedures for SMEs and the provision of adequate information for market players.
The last point covered by Mr Radwan - and one with which I concur - is the need for global standards in a global environment.
Therefore it is extremely important to reach agreements with the other major world financial markets, notably the United States.
This calls for greater dynamism and a more significant role for the European institutions, including this Parliament and all those listening today.
<D>
- (SK) Mr President, Commissioner, allow me to begin by thanking both rapporteurs for a well-balanced report.
In connection with this report I will first of all respond to the current problems in the Euro Zone.
And despite ten years of positive effects achieved through its operation, the Euro Zone faces new challenges over how to confront the financial crisis and the subsequent economic recession.
I would like to contribute by pointing out some of the unsystematic regulatory interventions made by a number of Member State governments in the market under the pretext of sorting out this new situation.
I must say with some surprise that the governments of Member States are often encouraged to make certain unhelpful interventions in the financial sector by some of the statements from certain representatives of the European Union, and these often resolve only the peripheral aspects of the situation.
This applies in the case of adherence to the conditions of the Stability and Growth Pact, for example, where some governments are already signalling that they will apparently not be sticking to a planned deficit in their public finances and referring in this context to the encouragement of the European Union.
The takeover of troubled financial institutions by the governments of some Member States will create a dangerous precedence for the expropriation of private companies in any sector whatsoever who are not willing to adapt themselves to un-systematic regulatory and discriminatory interventions carried out, for example, in the interests of holding down inflation.
The large-scale financial interventions in some sectors of the economy, such as the automobile industry, give rise to questions as to whether or not such interventions cause excessive market deformation and also discriminate against other sectors.
Without clear and careful coordination and clear rules at a European Union or Euro Zone level, it will be difficult to manage these very challenging processes.
In this context, I would like to urge the representatives of the European Commission and the European Central Bank and other relevant EU institutions to take a considered and coordinated position when looking for an optimal solution in these difficult times, when the whole of Europe faces economic recession.
In the short-term, excessive regulation and government intervention in the free market may temporarily halt further economic collapse in the EU, but in the medium term they will certainly not bring the boost to development that is so much expected.
<D>
(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, we are debating a directive which truly does resolve the problem of the use of health services in other Member States.
These services are already being used.
However, the directive harmonises and regulates the conditions of use of such services.
I agree with what my fellow Members said about the need for health services to be of a high standard and to be available to citizens close to where they live.
However, we often have to use health services in other Member States, especially for rare diseases and new treatments.
I also welcome the fact that special reference is made to health services at hot springs and spas.
Use of these services allows us to improve the prevention and treatment of numerous diseases at little cost and this may be very important to the 'health' of our insurance funds.
I call on you, Commissioner, to give real support to this initiative to promote these services.
<D>
Madam President, after a long debate, we finally have a text which we as Socialists can support, and I welcome this compromise on the Lisbon resolution.
However, let me start by expressing a personal opinion, which is that having an idea is not the whole solution.
Everything depends on the execution.
One has to put the two together.
In 2000, the idea of Lisbon was good and very timely.
Nor could we identify better targets than we did during the 2005 review.
But if one looks at the execution itself - especially looking back at that execution through time and along the full decision-making chain - it is another story.
There has been an improvement compared to the first five years, and we have acquired some dynamism, but the results compared to the needs and the global challenges we face, and compared to the potential we have, are limited.
We have had some great initiatives and success stories, like the Growth and Jobs programme or the 'Think Small First' project, and there have been some great legislative successes - the Services Directive, the supervision of the financial markets regulation, climate change policy and the new energy package, to list just a few.
But the overall feeling is missing, and the commitment itself is missing.
In the European institutions we can see this in the decreased use of the expression 'connecting to the agenda'.
It can be seen in the very low interest in the topic last week during the joint parliamentary session with the national parliaments, and it can be seen simply by reading the Eurobarometer results.
I would like to quote two numbers from the Eurobarometer.
The so-called optimism index has decreased over the last nine months by nine points, from 26 to 17.
Also, if one looks at other key performance indicators, the employment optimism index has fallen by three points from +4 to +1 in the last nine months.
If one looks further, the key elements of the Lisbon Strategy are amongst the last issues people consider to be the most important.
This means that, eight years after Lisbon, European citizens do not believe that the EU can provide proper responses on these issues.
So Lisbon is still in our documents, but is certainly not in our hearts and minds.
In the 21st century the race of continents will not be decided only by natural and energy resources or by financial resources.
The power of human capital and human resources will determine the winner.
The conjunction of the total population, in terms of quantity, and the consistency of its knowledge, in terms of quality, will jointly decide the strength of the Community.
We still have a lot to do as regards knowledge creation, knowledge management and the motivation of people as a Community.
This is a Community that we need to consider as a whole, not letting anyone be discriminated against.
We cannot leave anyone out, whether young or old, black or white, rich or poor.
We need everyone - the people as a whole.
In the 21st century, real people will be central, yet the Commission President is not here today to speak about this ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
<D>
(RO) The Mafra Summit of 26 October 2007 will take place on the brink of events of major importance for the future of the relations between the European Union and Russia.
I would mention only a few of them: the expiry of the partnership and cooperation agreement between the European Union and Russia, the parliamentary elections of December 2007 and the presidential elections of March 2008 in Russia.
This context offers the possibility not only to urge Russia toward an open and honest dialogue with the European Union, but also to make a cold review of the last 10 years of cooperation.
Joining the previous speeches of my colleagues, I would like to focus my speech on the important role Russia should play in the common neighbourhood and in the Black Sea region.
The review of the last 10 years proves to us that frozen conflicts have persisted in this region and that Russia's economic and political relations both with the countries in the region and with its neighbours, current European Union Members, are not always based on reciprocity, confidence and the principle of good relations.
If we speak about frozen conflicts, a good recent and well-known example in this respect refers to the conditions under which the political prisoners Andrei Ivanţoc and Tudor Popa were released, they being living proof of the fact that there is instability in the area, that there is an area of insecurity that affects the entire region.
Consequently, the Mafra Summit should also approach these themes, reminding of the fundamental objective that the European Union has undertaken - namely to create a true area of democracy, stability and prosperity in the Black Sea region and common neighbourhood.
In this context, Russia's position and constructive involvement in this respect, in compliance with the international standards and obligations, should be a permanent theme in the European Union dialogue with this country.
A truly strategic partnership and a strong and advantageous relationship involve increased responsibility and a firm commitment from both parties.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Indicators reveal that over the last decade, there has been a disconnection between wage and productivity developments in Greece.
This has generated competitiveness losses, reflected in persistent current account deficits and a fall in export market shares.
Labour market rigidities and wage setting have been identified as an important factor behind the excessive wage growth in Greece and the resulting gap in unit labour costs with its main trading partners.
In recent years, domestic demand has been the main contributor to economic growth, fuelled by buoyant growth in general government expenditure and household incomes.
Private final consumption expenditure per capita increased by more than 80% over the last decade.
This model has clearly been unsustainable, resulting in the build-up of significant fiscal, which means a high general government deficit and growth debt stock, increasing interest payments and macro-economic, which implies a high current account deficit and external debt outflow of income imbalances.
The increased financing needs of the government have resulted in the public sector absorbing a large part of the available financing, thus ruling out the private sector and adversely affecting the economy's growth prospects.
Economy-wide wage moderation, with public sector wage cuts playing an important signalling role to the private sector, and fiscal austerity measures are thus indispensable to put the Greek economy on a stronger footing by restoring competitiveness and achieving fiscal consolidation.
The Commission is aware that fiscal austerity measures and wage moderation may have a negative short-term impact on demand.
Nonetheless, given the current situation that Greece is facing, these measures are necessary to restore market confidence and to lay down the foundations for a more sustainable growth model for the Greek economy in the long term.
Greece has adopted an ambitious programme to correct its deficit and to reform its public administration and the economy.
The consolidation measures taken by Greece are important for enhancing fiscal sustainability and market confidence and have been strongly welcomed by the Commission, the Eurogroup, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
The courageous measures included in the stability programme and the packages announced in February and March 2010 include not only the envisaged wage cuts through a reduction in allowances paid to civil servants and Easter, summer and Christmas bonuses, but also measures to improve the tax collection mechanism, widen the tax base and increase tax compliance.
In the communication adopted on 9 March 2010, the Commission concluded that Greece is implementing the Council Decision of 16 February 2010 and that, based on available information, the fiscal measures announced by the Greek authorities on 3 March appear sufficient to safeguard the 2010 budgetary targets.
<D>
On the whole, this report is a fairly worthwhile contribution to the debate on the role of agriculture in food supply.
Parliament has rightly identified the problems which farmers have to contend with in times of extreme market and price volatility and drawn attention to the difficulties which farmers are currently going through in this respect.
The Commission must come up with tough and lasting measures to address volatility in the agricultural markets.
That is crucial to maintaining production in the EU.
The huge price increases in the financial markets for agricultural commodities have largely been caused by speculation.
Speculative behaviour accounts for almost 50% of recent price increases.
It is good that the European Parliament has supported the conclusions of the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food concerning the disastrous role of large institutional investors such as hedge funds, pension funds and investment banks, because they affect the price indices of raw materials, through their activities on the derivatives markets.
Parliament has produced a generally sound analysis of the situation, but has then totally missed the mark by failing to formulate pertinent observations on the role of GMOs in agriculture in the report.
This debate is being conducted elsewhere and does not belong here, which is why I have ultimately voted against the report.
<D>
President of the Commission. - Mr President, thank you for this very interesting debate, where I think there was a very large consensus supporting the priorities that were presented by the Slovenian Presidency.
During my first statement I highlighted some - because I could not go into detail on all aspects - of the priorities for our work during these six months: the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty, the new cycle of the Lisbon Strategy and also our climate and energy package.
Specifically on this point, I was very encouraged by the support that many of you gave to our work on this matter.
It is very important that we now deliver on our commitments.
The Heads of State and Government agreed on ambitious targets - a 20% reduction in the emission of greenhouse gases and 20% for renewables.
We cannot have the targets and then not deliver on the means of achieving those targets.
It is a question of coherence and of credibility, and I was very encouraged by the support given to this during today's debate.
I would like just to answer one question that was brought to the debate by Mr Schulz, Mr Lambsdorff and Mr Brok regarding a specific problem that is now being discussed in Germany - the question of possible funding for relocation of a company in Europe.
I can tell you that the operational programme on competitiveness for Romania has a specific clause banning the use of Structural Funds for the cofinancing of delocalisation.
The European Commission has not received any project relevant to this issue, so the Commission can confirm that no European regional development funding is implicated in this relocation.
Of course we consider that it would be unacceptable to use funding from European Union funds for relocation inside the European Union.
(Applause)
At the same time it is true that the European Union, through the PHARE programme, has funded an industrial park in Romania where several companies are now investing.
This is important and I will draw the attention of all my colleagues here, especially our German friends, to this debate and how important it is to have a responsibility in this debate.
We have to make a distinction between delocalisation outside the European Union and relocation in Europe.
If investment goes from Finland to Germany, it can also go from Germany to Romania.
Let us be honest about it.
We have to make clear that this is not delocalisation outside the European Union.
As you remember, the Commission and I have proposed a Globalisation Adjustment Fund that is already working precisely for cases where some jobs could be affected by delocalisations outside the European Union.
It is very important that European leaders at all levels in the European Union - in the Commission, in the European Parliament, but also at national level - also have the courage to explain the benefits of enlargement.
(Applause)
Germany is the country that is now exporting more to the new Member States.
The enlargement of the European Union is creating jobs in Germany too.
German companies are also investing a lot in the new Member States.
So it very important from a European perspective that we all explain that enlargement of the European Union is not only good for the new Members but it is also an opportunity for the European Union as a whole.
(Applause)
At the same time, I agree that we have to check that no Structural Funds money is used to finance a specific delocalisation of a company.
That would be unfair competition.
But I call on all those who are pro-European to stand up and defend this united enlarged Europe, and also to exploit the benefits that we all, in all the new Member States, are getting from this more dynamic Europe that we can build today.
(Applause)
<D>
in writing. - Trafficking in human beings is a crime against human dignity that ruins the lives of many children and women throughout the world.
The current proposal is a breakthrough because it puts victims first and tackles the problem in a complex, cross-border manner.
These new measures will facilitate the reconnaissance and prosecution of trafficking cases and will encourage victims to cooperate with the authorities.
This will be binding legislation, subject to state enforcement.
This type of regulation is the only one that can make a difference for all vulnerable people who might fall prey to trafficking.
I also call on Member States to follow the proposal in this text and punish those who knowingly accept the services of a victim of trafficking.
Fighting demand is key to fighting the roots of trafficking.
This report is an excellent proposal, morally and professionally, and I congratulate my distinguished colleagues, Bauer and Hedh, for this.
I am particularly happy that the Council and FEMM and LIBE Committees managed to create a text that is backed by all relevant institutions in the EU.
I hope that it will soon be formally adopted and transposed into national law.
The victims are eager to see it.
<D>
(RO) As rapporteur for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament for the SIS issue, I am going to speak about this very matter.
First of all, I would like to congratulate Mr Coelho for the huge effort he has invested in this and, in particular, for the consistency he has shown in finalising these two reports.
I would also like to thank Commissioner Malmström because, since she has taken up her post, the Commission has started to show some transparency.
What has caused, and continues to cause, us concern is the failure to meet the deadlines for implementing SIS II.
Parliament has expressed its position on several occasions on the delays, especially regarding the Commission's inability to set a precise date for launching its operation.
The fact that we do not know for sure even now whether the tests carried out have been successful or not only serves to raise serious doubts about how the project is being managed.
Given that it is the European Parliament's duty to monitor the way in which Community money is spent, the proposal to keep in reserve the funds due to be allocated to the development of SIS II during the 2011 budget year is a normal safety measure to take.
Parliament must be continually consulted on and informed about the progress of the SIS II project, which cannot be compromised due to a lack of political will or management ability.
It must meet current requirements, support data protection and comply with the cost/benefit principle, with its deployment taking place within the exact timeframes specified for its implementation.
<D>
Mr President, I voted against this measure.
It seems that climate alarmism and environmentalism are rapidly taking on the characteristics of a religion.
They are based on faith not fact.
And the possibility of carbon offsetting has been rightly compared with the medieval purchase of papal indulgences.
Now we have Mr Nassauer introducing what appears to be a sort of environmental blasphemy law.
I have considerable reservations about these environmental issues being dealt with by criminal law rather than civil law, in any case.
But the real problem here is the extension of European law.
The people I represent want to have trade, want to have cooperation in Europe but they do not want political union and they do not want a European legal system.
We should resist every further move to create Europe responsibilities and European competence in these areas.
<D>
in writing. - We have just voted on an agreement for civil aviation safety.
Although travel by air is one of the safest means of travel, however, one can never take measures which are too safe.
Linked to this discussion is that related to security.
Since the horrendous terror attack on the twin towers, innumerable security measures have been put in place.
Just like the issue of safety one can never be too secure.
Indeed, it is when we feel too secure that terror strikes again.
Of course, one has to find a balance between civil liberties and rights and security measures; however, when it comes down to a choice one has to prioritise.
For instance, there has been a substantial deal of opposition to the sharing of passenger lists on the basis of data protection.
But surely such security measures will enable an in-depth analysis not possible at the frontiers.
We are living in a new era.
Innocent civilians are purposely targeted and the civilians of certain countries preselected.
In such an environment surely we are not expecting these countries to abstain from doing all that which is possible to protect the interests of its citizens.
<D>
(RO) 2008 is the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue.
This is an opportunity for all 27 Member States to promote their culture, history, language and traditions.
The Union's motto is ”Unity in diversity”, and 2008 should make a real contribution to strengthening cohesion within the Union, using intercultural dialogue as a basis.
Over the centuries, Romania has been under various influences - Byzantine, Russian, Austro-Hungarian, and Ottoman.
86% of the Romanian population are Eastern Orthodox, and Romania is the only Romance-speaking country where Eastern Orthodoxy is dominant.
I would like to emphasize that 18 denominations enjoy official recognition in Romania.
However, intercultural dialogue should include interdenominational dialogue.
I would like to ask the 34 delegations of the European Parliament to enhance their promotion of European values on other continents in the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, and to facilitate the knowledge of other cultures and traditions.
It is my hope that the intercultural dialogue of 2008 will make an effective contribution to fostering peace, one of the European Union's fundamental values.
<D>
Coal mining in Europe is not efficient, and has to be subsidised.
However, so-called alternative energy sources are equally - if not more - inefficient.
Power plants burning coal therefore have one thing in common with solar or wind-powered plants.
The power they produce is simply too expensive.
States therefore subsidise coal mining, or purchase the electricity produced at a higher price than the price paid by the end user.
Every method of producing electricity has its pluses and minuses.
However, experience has taught us that it is not good to rely on one source of energy.
If the energy security of Europe is a priority for us, then it would be a mistake to abandon one of the possible energy sources.
The state should not use taxpayers' money to support non-functioning enterprises.
Not all mines that are currently unable to survive on the market without subsidies are inevitably doomed to fail.
Some of them may become competitive if they are given time to transform.
The report of Mr Rapkay wants to make this possible for them.
I come from the Prievidza region, which has a strong mining tradition.
I know how many families would fall into poverty if the fathers lost a job in the mines.
On their behalf, too, I have voted in favour of the report, which creates an opportunity to save thousands of jobs in a traditional Slovak mining region.
<D>
in writing. - (PT) The aim of this report is to 'polish up' the European strategy for preserving cod stocks.
Since November 2000, when the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) drew attention to the serious risk of collapse in cod stocks in the North Sea and off western Scotland, and at the Council meeting in December 2000, Fisheries Ministers and the Commission have expressed concern at the critical state of stocks.
Given the different situations in the various fisheries, this European Parliament report aims to ensure greater flexibility of action, taking into account the different fishery and stock conditions in the various areas in which the recovery plans for this species will apply.
Guaranteeing greater involvement of the relevant Regional Advisory Councils (RACs) and Member States in the effective management of cod stocks is one of the priorities of this report.
Express reference to the RACs and Member States in the legislation will give a clear indication that the EU institutions are serious about involving these stakeholders in future development of fisheries management systems.
I voted in favour of this report.
<D>
(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, many people have already said this, but I must say it again: I believe that this is a particularly serious matter.
It is serious firstly because our American allies have deliberately - it must be borne in mind that they have done it deliberately - chosen to deal separately with European Union Member States on matters which they know very well are part of the competences of the European Union, taking advantage of that to make unreasonable security demands.
It is also serious, though, from the point of view of the Union.
It is a sad sight to see the Member States lining up separately in order to be able to offer their citizens the prospect of a trip to the United States without a visa, in exchange for security measures that the Americans could not negotiate with the Union as such.
I believe that this mess is the unfortunate result of a tragic lack of political strategy on our part.
Until now, the Commission and the Council have dealt with the United States administration pragmatically, on a case-by-case basis, each time at the request of the Americans, without ever having the courage to demand real reciprocity from the Americans.
I am not addressing that remark to Mr Frattini, because I know he has tried, but he was not supported.
If I understand it correctly, given the seriousness and urgency of the situation, the Commission is now asking for an explicit negotiating mandate to ensure that the Americans comply with what they should have complied with from the outset, Community law and Union competences.
We shall support the efforts by the Commission on this point, but the Commission must not forget that it will be needing Parliament, especially when the Treaty has been ratified, because nothing that is being done now can enter into force if Parliament does not authorise it at some point.
The Commissioner should tell that to his successor, whether temporary or permanent.
<D>
author. - (FI) Mr President, this court decision is important and categorical.
It clearly shows that the legislative process in the EU must be under the democratic scrutiny of the people and that protecting the institutions in the decision-making process is of secondary importance.
It is a clear argument.
Against this background, I am really rather disappointed with the responses.
When I heard the Council's response, it was emphasised several times that transparency and openness were important, but there was not much else.
What has been done?
The Commission, meanwhile, has asked for more time.
The attitude the EU institutions have adopted towards the court decision I think is really interesting.
What if our citizens were to adopt the same attitude towards the court decision as the Commission and the Council and did not care about the decision at all?
It just would not happen.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - First of all, what we are doing just now is evaluating all the ideas and information that we have got.
In this context we are trying to judge whether we should target our money in a specific way.
We have not yet finalised our internal discussions, but I can say this regarding children: I think it is of huge importance that first of all we ensure that our young people are well nourished and therefore we will also publish this year an idea (and I hope to get full support for it) for a school fruit scheme in cofinancing with Member States that can offer children at a certain age the possibility to have a piece of fruit at school.
I think it is in general a good idea providing a good habit to young people that hopefully will follow them throughout their lifetime.
As to giving special priority to organic production: I think we have to choose between the devil and the deep blue sea, because if we choose organic we get less food and I think that is going to be a very difficult judgement to make.
Subject: Speculation and the food crisis
Financial speculation is a major factor behind rising prices and the world food crisis.
The commodities market in particular is attracting growing interest from investment funds.
Is the Commission prepared to accept that, for the benefit of the few, commodities such as rice or wheat are becoming the focus of speculation while, at the same time, millions of people are dying of hunger?
Does it intend to take practical steps to end all financial speculation which directly jeopardises the food security of millions of people?
Does it also intend to promote the implementation at international level of a mechanism preventing countries from restricting exports of foodstuffs of which they hold large stocks and, more generally, from pursuing all policies that have the direct result of preventing the most vulnerable from exercising their right to food?
Part two
<D>
(ES) Mr President, the thoughts raised in this report on the issue of sanctions are very welcome.
It is obvious that the issue needs some serious thought: too many times sanctions have proven to be entirely futile and, in many cases, entirely unfair; too many times they have harmed the weakest in society.
Why do fishermen in Mauritania have to pay for the fact that, suddenly, there has been a coup in their country?
Where is the sense in that?
The sanctions should therefore be reviewed and analysed: both the concept itself and its application.
Moreover, when they are imposed too frequently, and incoherently, as the European Union does, they lose credibility and so does the European Union.
It is one thing to take into account our own interests and quite another for this to be the barometer for whether or not to impose sanctions.
It is essential that we have specific monitoring of the effectiveness of these measures; it is essential that we promote intelligent sanction methods, so that they affect those responsible for human rights violations directly and personally.
We are learning from what the United States have done in North Korea and the freezing of bank accounts in Macao.
We are studying this example, which received very little publicity but was much more effective than holding numerous press conferences against a particular government.
I therefore support this report, but there is still work to be done by the Commission and the Council in order to genuinely monitor what is being done, why it is being done and how it is being done.
<D>
in writing. - (NL) We are still glad that the European Parliament excluded heath care services from the general directive on services.
Healthcare is after all a specific sector requiring a specific approach.
The fundamental premise of the proposal, in line with established case-law, has to be that the organisation and funding of healthcare are the responsibility of Member States.
This means on the one hand that patient mobility cannot be made an absolute right and on the other hand that there are no excuses for not investing in one's own health system.
That premise also necessarily implies that Member States must be able to charge the real cost to the patient.
There must be solidarity, but there must also be the possibility of differential treatment for patients who have contributed in their own country through the social security and tax system and foreign patients who have not.
The fact that we have the directive is a good thing, but anyone familiar with the sector feels that it still needs a lot more work.
To my mind the quality, accessibility and financial sustainability of healthcare on the basis of socially responsible solidarity remain the key criteria here.
<D>
in writing. - I voted in favour of the proposed amendments by the EP to the citizens' initiative, as I believe that they make the initiative stronger and enable more people to participate.
This is a historic moment in which European citizens are being given a concrete measure for bringing important issues and topics to EU level.
I urge the Commission to take note of the amendment asking for easy procedures and transparent information for citizens.
It is one thing to create such a mechanism, but it also has to be accessible and understandable to EU citizens in order to enable them to make full use of it.
Parliament is seeking an easing of the criteria with regard to signatories by asking that they should come from at least a fifth, rather than a third, of the Member States.
It is also calling for the creation of an easily accessible, free-of-charge online collection system for signatures.
I would especially like to underline the need to convene citizens' committees to organise initiatives.
The citizens' committees movement was one of the most important factors that led to the renewed independence of Estonia in 1991.
This is a clear sign that citizens together can bring down walls.
<D>
Madam President, Commissioner, I am sorry that Mr Visser did not stay to listen right to the end of the debate on this topic, but I must begin by saying that we support the Commission's proposals in this direction.
A complete reform of VAT would, of course, do a much better job, but as this is not possible at the moment, your proposal should resolve some of the problems encountered by Member States in their desire to contain VAT fraud.
Particularly in the context of a crisis, we think that it is of paramount importance for VAT revenue to be guaranteed as, at the moment, Member States are trying to invest billions to support the economy.
In this respect, every opportunity to limit the chance of fraud should be supported by Parliament.
I would also like to say that we support on the whole the proposals made by Mr Visser in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
They will perhaps instil slightly greater confidence among the business sector, compared to the initial proposals from the Commission.
However, we also think that the suggestion made in Article 1, point c) that the period between the delivery of the goods and the receipt of notification referred to in the second subparagraph should be two years is fairly short and, in our view, creates additional opportunities for restricting the scope and results of the European Commission's proposal.
This is why the PSE Group is suggesting that this period should be five years, which we believe is sufficiently short for the business sector, but also a long enough period for the tax administration to complete its work.
Furthermore, the introduction of this point c) is not linked either to suggestions concerning from what date and how it will come into force, which we think will create additional problems for Member States.
We hope that the proposal will be supported and yield its expected results.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - In response to the important and topical question from Ms Andrikienė, let me say that the Commission is fully aware of all the violations of the democratic principles and procedures which have been reported by a number of NGOs in the context of the local elections in Belarus.
The European Union's heads of mission in Minsk have also pointed to inconsistencies and indeed discrepancies, in particular, in the ballot counting.
Some amendments were made, ahead of the elections, to the Belarus electoral code.
According to the opinion of the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, which was issued on 3 June 2010, this represented, and I quote, 'a step towards removing some flaws' in the electoral code.
However, the report states that these amendments are unlikely to resolve the concerns that the electoral code continues to fall short of genuinely democratic elections.
In the light of this, during the visit I intend to pay to Minsk in July, I will convey to the authorities the clear message that progress needs to be made in a number of areas which are key to democratisation if Belarus is serious about re-engaging with the European Union.
One of these areas is electoral legislation, which is one of the most evident tests of democratic standards.
In this respect, I will urge Minsk to continue to cooperate with the OSCE order on the reform of the electoral code ahead of the next presidential elections.
In the run up to these elections, the Commission will also pay particular attention to other key aspects of democratisation, notably freedom of assembly, of the media and of NGOs and civil society, more generally, where no progress has been reported in recent times.
<D>
(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the modern human rights culture places more emphasis on being human than being a citizen.
It is a principle that requires foreigners, stateless persons and travellers to be treated as people equal to citizens as regards their basic human dignity, which requires a special solidarity towards the weakest, namely children in particular.
However, this sensitivity is not a valid excuse to turn the European Parliament into a stage to make the most absurd of accusations, namely racism, against a national government which declares - at least this is the context of the documents we are talking about - that it is taking charge not only of public order but also of the defence of children, with reference to some nomadic communities in situations of special emergency.
The answer to the questions submitted can be found simply by reading the acts adopted by the Italian Government, limited as has already been said to three regions out of twenty.
You may be surprised to learn that the words 'Roma' and 'fingerprints' are not in these documents.
It is not true, therefore, that there is express provision to register everyone of a particular race; neither is it true that a military census regime is to be introduced.
The discretionary powers granted to the police commissioners must take account of the humanitarian and welfare profiles and be aimed - at least this is the declared intention - at human promotion, integration, especially of minors, with particular attention to schooling.
Of course there could also be reason to fear that the measures in question might be implemented with military or repressive means.
It is therefore right to hope, but in a spirit of close cooperation, that priority will be given to positive action and action for support, reception, integration, especially in relation to minors, notwithstanding the duty of every public institution to enforce the law.
It is unreasonable to expect more.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, this was a very interesting debate but a debate that has shown that the reflections are quite different - there are different points of view and different aspects, and in a similar way we see some different aspects prevailing in the debate in the Council.
I absolutely agree with our Council President and our friend that the most important thing is that we speak with one voice, and with a strong voice.
This should be done at the next European Summit meeting with Russia.
What are our interests?
I think I made this quite clear in my first intervention.
Since we are so interdependent, there are all the important interests on the economic side and the energy side, but there are also interests on the world scene.
These were mentioned - climate change, energy security, the question of how we can get a future agreement in Copenhagen.
What do we do on Iran, on the Middle East?
There is a clear interest in all the different issues, and this is what I wanted to stress and reiterate.
We will have a very important discussion at the next General Affairs and External Relations Council on 10 November, and I hope that we will find the right understanding on pursuing negotiations for the new EU-Russia agreement, because these have only been postponed.
I think what our President said was very clear.
I say this because I think this is the best possible way forward, but at the same time we also have to be firm.
We have to treat Russia as it is and not Russia as we wish it to be.
That is also clear.
That means human rights dialogue as described today and speaking about all the differences.
This is what we did at the last summits at which I personally was present.
As regards all the questions that have been asked about the 8 000 troops, the European Council has given a clear answer to that and has noted with satisfaction that Russian troops have withdrawn from the zones adjacent to South Ossetia and Abkhazia as an essential additional step in the implementation of the agreements of 12 August and 8 September, as well as the launch of the Geneva international discussions provided for by those agreements.
I think Geneva is the place to continue talks about the political solution.
These started with a difficult moment, but the process is launched and now we want to go forward.
That is my first point.
Secondly, Russia will not be at the donors' conference, to give you a clear answer, but I think the time will come when the question of damages might have to be brought to the fore, and an international investigation then held.
This has already been discussed in the Council, and the Council was in favour of such an international discussion.
Let me now say a word on human rights.
As I said before, there are a number of developments inside Russia that give us cause for concern, notably the violent deaths of journalists, restrictions on NGOs, the situation in the Northern Caucasus in general and in Ingushetia in particular.
We have also called for full investigations into cases such as the death of Anna Politkovskaya and the recent killing after police arrest of Magomed Yevloyev.
The latest round of human rights consultations, as I said, takes place today and will certainly also provide an opportunity to clearly mention those concerns.
We have also made clear to Russia that it needs to cooperate fully with the Council of Europe and to ratify Protocol 14 on the Court of Human Rights and Protocol 6 on the death penalty.
Concerning WTO accession: we, the European Union, remain a strong supporter of WTO accession because we think this will create a level playing field, which is necessary for our Economic Community, and we believe it is in our interests as a major trading partner for Russia to join a rules-based system.
But it is also important from the perspective of further development of our bilateral relations.
It is most important therefore that we continue to support this issue.
We have to continue to engage openly with the Russian side on this important process, but it is clear that we have to find timely solutions with them and for them.
The question of energy security and clear energy was mentioned.
Let me just say that we also have an energy dialogue and an environmental dialogue and, therefore, the questions of energy efficiency, clear energy etc. have already been tackled at different G8 meetings and at our EU summits, and will certainly be one of the important themes in the run-up to Copenhagen, where we also need Russia's cooperation.
The Commission has supported joint implementation projects under the Kyoto Protocol and is ready to do more, because we think this is a most important issue.
Concerning the European security architecture, I just wanted to clarify that President Medvedev already mentioned this at the June EU-Russia Summit at Khanty-Mansiysk - not after the Georgia crisis but before.
I was there and know that very well, so I just wanted to mention it for the purpose of clarification.
This is an old Russian idea that has come to the fore again, and I think it interesting that President Sarkozy has proposed to maybe speak about it at an OSCE summit in 2009.
We are not yet there, but let me say that it is most important that the question of a security partnership be discussed, but always with regard to all existing security relationships.
That is also a clear line that we have to draw.
As a final remark, let me say that it is so important that we advance the question of frozen conflicts - that is clear - and I will propose a Communication on the Eastern Partnership very soon, at the end of November/beginning of December.
We have already discussed this in the Council, and it will also have a very strong security component, but we also have other institutional mechanisms like the Minsk Group that should not, therefore, be excluded.
My last words concern cluster bombs, because this was also mentioned.
Let me say that we also deeply regret that cluster bombs have been used on both sides, thus creating great obstacles for IDPs to return home.
Therefore, we want to engage with the international organisations working in that field in order to clear the affected areas, but also to see that these cluster bombs no longer exist in the future.
<D>
(NL) Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, at the time I was rapporteur for the social action plan presented to us by Mrs Diamantopoulou and completed under the previous French Presidency under Mrs Aubry.
What concerns me, ladies and gentlemen, is how European social ambitions have systematically crumbled away.
To my mind there are clear political reasons for this.
It is noticeable how the Commission always stresses that social policy must remain a national matter.
Commissioner, the social package contains very interesting working documents and statements, but only four legislative initiatives.
However welcome, that is certainly a very meagre result!
As if protecting social rights, creating a social level playing field, is no longer a European responsibility in the Europe of 27.
Together with the EPP and the social organisations, we expect, on top of this social package, at least stronger legislation in regard to posting that protects social rights, better legislation to eliminate the wage gap between men and women, a framework law to protect social services and binding commitments in the fight against poverty.
What we need is a real social pact, with a coherent vision and a serious commitment to a social Europe, so that at least we show citizens that Europe is more than just a market.
I hope, Mr Bertrand, that we can for now count on the support of the French Presidency in this fight.
<D>
Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for your opinion and your commitment to this matter.
I would like to underline what you said, namely that we are facing huge challenges in our neighbourly relations as regards stability, democratic change and now, of course, economic development as well.
Now is therefore also a good time for us to express our commitment and our readiness to cooperate closely with our eastern neighbours.
It is clear - and we should also say openly - that we have an interest in the influence we as the European Union have on our eastern neighbours.
However, we want to extend our influence, not by violence, not by threats and not by coercion, but by offering to support precisely those countries in their search for stability and democratic change.
I hope that they really are all seeking democratic change, particularly now when, like Ukraine, they have huge economic problems.
Economic problems, for some of which they are not to blame, but of course for some of which they are also partly responsible.
We should also be aware that we also need to be critical of some things.
Precisely because we are offering our support, we also need to criticise what we think needs criticising and to demand what is necessary in order for these countries to play their part too.
I am thinking in particular of Ukraine, but I will come back to this country shortly.
It is absolutely vital that we do not see this Eastern Partnership as a tool to use against Russia, but rather as a strengthening of the countries which, in terms of neighbours, have the European Union on one side and Russia on the other, as - all being well - Russia should become our partner, particularly with regard to this policy.
I am very pleased that the United States and President Obama, together with Vice-President Biden and the Secretary of State Mrs Clinton, are now pursuing a different policy.
We should not hold back our criticism with regard to internal developments in Russia.
However, the reset button of which Mr Biden spoke in Munich should also be pressed as an attempt, as an offer to Russia to start a new relationship.
In this regard, my group is not particularly happy about the fact that the report by Mr Onyszkiewicz, as agreed in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, does not take up what the US is now offering.
We are lagging behind the US.
That is terrible.
We should be going forward with the US, while naturally always keeping the issue of human rights in the foreground.
This will be necessary and I hope that we shall still achieve a joint resolution on Russia.
This, in my opinion, is vital.
I have already mentioned that our offer, our Eastern Partnership, does not mean that we approve of everything that is happening in our neighbouring countries.
For example, if I consider the situation in Ukraine, it must not be a case of 'no matter what you do, what disputes you have and what problems you fail to solve, you will have the support of the European Union'.
The leading forces in Ukraine must ultimately address the problems together, because the gas crisis is linked to a dispute within the political spectrum of Ukraine, and that, to us, is totally unacceptable.
I do not wish to apportion blame here - we can all form our own opinion.
However, it is absolutely vital that we make this clear to Ukraine.
The same applies to Georgia and to all other countries.
The European Union has made an offer and I hope that our eastern neighbours will accept this offer, take it seriously and actually make stability and democracy a reality.
<D>
Mr President, Mr Giscard d'Estaing, Mr Juncker, Mr Trichet, Mr Almunia, ladies and gentlemen, I find it very regrettable that relatively few Members are here today for this formal sitting, because it really is a historic event.
We have already heard from the various previous speakers how much scepticism there was when the euro was first introduced.
It was felt that the logistical challenges involved in introducing billions of banknotes and coins alone would be unmanageable, and the idea that we could combine a common monetary policy with separate fiscal policies in the Member States was seen not just as a major challenge but as simply impossible.
Today, the facts tell a rather different story.
European monetary union is a reality; the euro has been in existence for 10 years today.
This is something of a minor political miracle, and once again the words of Walter Hallstein, the first President of the Commission, have proven to be true: 'Anyone who does not believe in miracles in European matters is not a realist.'
The doubts of the citizens, many of whom, in many Member States, initially believed that the euro would result in huge price hikes, have now disappeared.
The euro has now been accepted, and even enthusiastically welcomed by many citizens.
It has become something of a visible European identifier: besides the anthem and the flag, it is one of the few symbols we have today.
It could, I think, be said that, in the European Central Bank's first few years, Europe and the European economy were sailing in relatively calm waters, so that the bank found it pretty easy to pursue a policy of stability.
Even so, it is worth pointing out that the mean inflation rate over the first 10 years of the euro has been approximately 2%, in other words more or less on the target that the European Central Bank set itself.
The German mark, on the other hand, which was always held up as a poster child for stability, had a mean inflation rate of 3% over its 50 years of existence.
It can therefore be said that the European Central Bank has performed very well.
However, it is now, in this time of crisis, that the European Central Bank is showing its true strength, its true quality.
It has a hugely important role to play here.
It has proven itself to be independent, efficient and self-confident, and it acts decisively and quickly.
It has become an example for some central banks, both in those European countries that are not yet part of the euro area and outside Europe.
It has made it quite clear to the Federal Reserve in the United States that it can pursue a successful policy, not despite its independence but precisely because it is politically independent and not subject to instructions from various governments.
We now know that at the moment, after the banking sectors in the individual Member States have been brought under a protective umbrella, the Member States are in the process of developing various economic stimulus plans to absorb the negative impact of the financial crisis on the real economy.
This will present the European Central Bank with further challenges, because there is a risk that the differences in approach will result in distortions of competition, and that the convergence we have, in part, now achieved between the members of the euro area will be lost and we will see increasingly divergent developments.
This needs to be counteracted, which is why it is so crucial and so important that the Stability and Growth Pact must not be undermined or discarded.
Quite the reverse: we must ensure that it remains valid.
That is why it is also so important for the necessary structural reforms, which the Commission and the European Central Bank have repeatedly called for in the past, actually to be pursued in the individual Member States.
The European Central Bank will gain a new task in the coming years.
The crisis has taught us that we need some kind of European supervision of the financial market, and this is an area where the European Central Bank can play a major role.
It has signalled that it is, in principle, willing to introduce some kind of central European supervisory system analogous to the European System of Central Banks.
The euro's international role needs to be further strengthened.
The euro area needs to speak with one voice, and also be represented as a unit in international organisations such as the International Monetary Fund and the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development).
It is still true that a single currency without a single fiscal economic policy is, and will continue to be, a risky undertaking.
This is no mere bagatelle.
The EU is still facing some major challenges: we are facing high, and unfortunately rising, levels of unemployment, demographic changes, migratory pressures, increasing poverty in some sectors of society, and stiffer competition in the context of globalisation.
The euro area will only be able to meet these challenges if the economic policies of the Member States can be more closely interlinked.
The appointment of a president of the euro area was the first step in this direction, but it is only the first step: more is now needed.
<D>
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Minister, Commissioner, at the last moment we are breaking the EU's rather compromising silence on the matter of Georgia.
In the conflict that is taking place in Abkhazia and Ossetia the rights of a Russian minority are not at issue.
Despite the ethnic cleansing experienced by three hundred thousand Georgians in this region after 1993, democratic Georgia has for some years been offering Abkhazia autonomous freedoms.
Despite this, Russia has recently taken steps towards recognising a puppet administration in Abkhazia by strengthening trade links and expanding the scope of Russian family, civil and commercial law to cover this area.
Today we need to ask ourselves a very important question: by opposing Georgia's membership of NATO, have we not encouraged Russia to take these actions?
This question should be posed in Berlin in particular.
This conflict is about geopolitics.
The credibility of the European Union and peace in the region are at stake.
If we cannot manage to stop Russia from pushing ahead with actions aimed at breaking up one of our key partners in the Caucasus, no one will set store by us in the future.
We should join the United States in arranging a meeting of the Security Council and the OSCE on this issue.
Besides firm diplomatic support for Georgia's integrity, we should demand that the Russian military is replaced by forces acting under a UN or OSCE mandate.
It would be worth sending a parliamentary mission to Tbilisi.
If we do not succeed in that, Russia and its neo-imperialist policy may push the entire region to the brink of war.
<D>
Madam President, I thank all colleagues who have spoken and who have supported the Barcelona Process over many years.
It is a wonderful concept and one that deserves to succeed.
I particularly welcome President Pöttering's initiative in forming some structure inside this Parliament to push forward the Barcelona Process, and President Sarkozy's commitment to strengthening the process as well with different aspects.
This Monday, 9 June, marks the opening of the European Union Mediterranean University.
Colleagues, I want you to note that date.
We say that our success rests on dialogue, and the European Mediterranean Process should be exemplified by a successful university.
I congratulate the Slovenian Presidency for offering the seat of the University, but I ask colleagues in all committees - and the Commission and the Council of Presidents - why has no budget been set aside for the University?
Surely we should not rely on one single presidential State - in this case, Slovenia - in furthering the future of the University.
If we want the University to succeed, we have to find a budget for the years ahead.
<D>
Commission. - (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank everyone for this responsible debate and their support for the European perspective of the Western Balkans.
I share the concern expressed in this discussion by Members such as Mrs Pack, Mr Swoboda and Mr Maaten regarding the political development of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
At times it seems as if Bosnia and Herzegovina has an unfailing ability to create and actually renew political tensions, even though common sense dictates that we should be expecting improved developments to move in another direction and political reconciliation to find a place in the political future of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
I agree with Mr Maaten that all the countries of the Western Balkans share the view that one day they will be able to join the European Union if they meet the conditions of Union membership, based as they are on the Copenhagen criteria.
This is also true of Bosnia and Herzegovina; in the case of the conditions that apply to them, there will be no shortcuts or bargain discounts, and if anyone assumes there will, he or she is wrong.
It is very important that this proper way of thinking gains a firm foothold in Bosnia and Herzegovina's own political debate, so that its citizens can draw their own conclusions about what sort of policy they have the right to expect from democratically elected politicians.
I see Bosnia and Herzegovina's future as follows, and my view is based on collaboration with Javier Solana, with whom we have produced several communications on the country's future and the role of the European Union there.
Firstly, our aim is to move away from the Dayton era to the Brussels era, that is, from the era of the international community's High Representative to the European Union's reinforced presence in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
That also probably means the 'two hat' system in the case of the EU Special Representative and Head of the European Commission Representation, so that we can exploit the political and economic resources the European Union has in the best possible way.
Obviously, a protectorate cannot apply for EU membership, and for that reason this transition is an organic ingredient, a vital element in Bosnia and Herzegovina's closer relations with the European Union, and it is because of that too that it is in the interests of politicians in the country and its citizens in particular that the terms and conditions of this process of change are met.
This issue also has political importance, because it is too easy to blame the international community for Bosnia and Herzegovina's problems, when people do not want to look in the mirror.
It is too easy to blame the High Representative when you should be negotiating and trying to reach agreement with your fellow countrymen and women.
I hope that in this respect Bosnia and Herzegovina's political culture will improve and mature and that the country's media will also take responsibility for ensuring that negative, nationalistic language does not get any more space than is the case at the present time in the country.
Secondly, the country needs to reform its constitution, in order for it to be able to build a viable system of government.
At the moment, Bosnia and Herzegovina's system of government is too costly, too ineffective and simply incompatible with membership of the European Union.
Accordingly, the constitution needs to be reformed - through evolution, not revolution - and I am pleased that there are some signs that leading politicians are discussing matters along these lines.
Thirdly and lastly, visa waiver is a crucial part of Bosnia and Herzegovina's future in Europe, and I am sure that, thus equipped, the country will be able to enter the European mainstream, which will surely be in the interests of the country itself, its citizens, and the European Union too.
<D>
(EL) Madam President, I should, of course, like to mention that we are examining the 10th report by the Ombudsman, who in 2006 received 3 889 letters or e-mails of complaint, 3 619 of which were sent by individual members of the public.
Of the 3 889 complaints, 3 051 were outside the mandate.
In other words, there were, in a single year, a total of 838 complaints within the mandate.
I therefore think that the Ombudsman's department is large enough in terms of staff and resources to handle 838 complaints, which, of course, mainly concern matters of maladministration by the Commission and the European Personnel Selection Office, and to a lesser degree the European Parliament and the Council.
It is of course commendable that the Ombudsman publishes a list of best administrative practices.
I do not know, however, whether his department allows citizens to make complaints about the operation of his own department.
I regret that the report by the Committee on Petitions refers us only to the European Personnel Selection Office, and not to the European Ombudsman, who until now has not carried out an ex officio scrutiny of his department.
We are therefore requesting not a change in the Ombudsman's Statute, but rather a strengthening of the rights that we already accord him.
This should allow him to show due respect for citizens, be very active in the correct administration of European institutions, and respect the personal data of citizens, Members of the European Parliament, and employees who are required to maintain secrecy.
The European Court of Justice should operate independently, without the Ombudsman's intervention, and there should be respect for the effective international agencies that operate independently to protect fundamental rights.
Our support for the European Ombudsman is not without limits.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first let me thank the rapporteur for presenting this report.
I believe it is important in this context to point out that we must look at energy policy in terms of a number of different objectives.
How can we ensure security of supplies, how can we ensure it does not harm the environment, and how can we also get it at a good price?
If we take account of those three factors in each of these debates, we will realise quite soon that renewables naturally play a part, probably an important part, in the future shape of energy, but that this sector alone cannot resolve the problem of energy supplies in terms of price formation, environmental impact or security of supplies.
That is why it is important to ask the questions that have already been put clearly by various speakers today, for instance to look at the question of how and where we can use renewable energy in the most economically intelligent manner, as we do for other resources.
We must consider where we can put the euro to the most effective use, which means we must not, for instance, promote solar energy in an area where conditions are not at all conducive to its use.
We must consider whether decisions and percentages, whether binding targets will really bring us forward or whether it would not be more sensible to do a little more to promote subsidiarity and to support initiatives that go in very different directions in different sectors depending on the Member State concerned, while leading to a comparable objective.
At the same time we must identify the drawbacks that also exist in the case of renewables.
We have already had debates about biofuels.
Six months ago the subject never even came up.
We have debated wind power and the damage it can cause.
In my country we have problems with finding enough space to develop wind power.
That does not mean saying no to these renewables, but it does mean a differentiated debate and a differentiated response, for in the end a sensible energy policy must not raise false expectations it cannot fulfil but must raise expectations that it can then fulfil step by step.
I thank the Commission for its very open and differentiated approach.
<D>
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it has been said that health services are a major pillar of the European social model.
For that reason, it seems entirely right that we should address the issue with a view to ensuring a high level of health protection and equal access to healthcare for all; unfortunately, the text under discussion does not seem to be moving in that direction.
We need to avoid striking at the roots of the purpose for which the directive should be issued, and that is to guarantee, within the framework of free movement, the right of citizens to take advantage of health services within the Union.
In practice, the text can be seen as an instrument geared towards opening up the health market at Community level, something which is quite different and could well lead to a right to health for the well-off.
The text provides solely for the reimbursement of the costs paid by them and only the cost of the health service as compared with the cost in the country of origin, disregarding the costs of travelling to and staying in the host country.
Further critical points have also been discussed, ranging from the need to guarantee standards of service at Community level to the important issue of information.
For those reasons, I consider that more detailed thought is needed so that we can try together to provide European citizens with the answers that are still lacking in the directive itself.
<D>
(NL) Mr President, it is a particularly unwise idea to liberalise visas for countries such as Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania.
In her explanatory statement, Ms Fajon said, in precisely these words, that this is mainly about students and young people coming to visit their friends and family.
Is this real naivety or are you just feigning naivety, in an attempt, as it were, to actively deny reality?
For instance, you argue in your report that scrapping the visa requirement will contribute to the elimination of ethnic and political instability.
Let us face it; the only thing we will be doing is simply importing much of that instability into the European Union.
Allow me to read you a quotation from a report by Europol, Eurojust and Frontex on the state of internal security in the EU.
This is a document from 7 May 2010.
'Albania, Kosovo, Serbia, Montenegro and FYROM are transit countries to the EU for illegal migrants and victims of human trafficking for sexual exploitation, cannabis products, heroin, cocaine, cigarettes, synthetic drugs and precursors, counterfeit Euros and firearms.
Albanian-speaking organised crime groups are prominent, particularly in trafficking heroin and women for sexual exploitation'.
Unquote.
Therefore, instead of tightening checks, we are now going to abolish visas, open our doors wide and make the problem of imported crime even worse.
<D>
(SK) Engaging ourselves against human rights violations must be a priority for the European Union in all circumstances.
Orlando Zapata, a Cuban political prisoner, died having staged a hunger strike.
Another Cuban prisoner is staging a hunger strike as a protest on behalf of 25 prisoners who are in very bad health and whose lives are threatened.
It is not a solution to do what the Spanish Government suggested when they offered asylum to the starving prisoner.
I am wondering about the Spanish Government, which is chairing the European Union at this time, because their proposal does not address the situation.
The immediate release of political prisoners is quite difficult.
And so I ask Commissioner Piebalgs to have the European Commission enter into negotiations with the Cuban Government to allow the International Red Cross to visit Cuban political prisoners.
This would enable an objective assessment of their condition and help in further negotiations.
The Red Cross was allowed to do this at the Guantánamo prison.
<D>
in writing. - (FR) I voted for this text, which requires the Member States to participate in collecting the necessary data to put together effective energy statistics.
This is a sine qua non for enabling the EU to fulfil its stated aim: phasing in a consistent European energy policy and speaking with a single voice on the international scene.
The Commission will have to ensure that these statistics are comparable, transparent, detailed and flexible.
The EU has undertaken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 and to make renewable energies account for 20% of total EU energy consumption by 2020, with the target set at 10% for biofuels.
The energy statistics system must adapt to these undertakings and take account of the increasing importance of energy efficiency, renewable energies, greenhouse gases, development of nuclear power and the emergence of biofuels.
Greater attention must also be paid to security of supply for the main fuels.
More timely and more accurate data at EU level are needed to anticipate and coordinate EU solutions to possible supply crises.
<D>
- (SK) I would like to express my appreciation for the text of the resolution on the EU general budget for 2009 submitted by the Committee on Budgets and its rapporteur, Jutta Haug.
Its wording expresses the risks of next year's EU budget in a thorough and comprehensive manner.
In my view, the main issue which is still open is budgetary provision for the impacts of the EU plan to deal with the consequences of the financial crisis.
The extent and direction of the crisis remains open.
The most important initiatives will be aimed at sustainable development, employment growth and support for small- and medium-sized businesses, as well as support for cohesion between the regions, which is a key factor for stimulating economic growth in Europe.
In 2009, we can expect to see a more rapid drawing down of resources from the structural and cohesion funds especially in the new states.
It is therefore appropriate to emphasise the obligation of the budgetary authorities to provide additional payments on time.
A potential source of these payments could be the EUR 7.7 billion reserve against the payment ceiling of the multi-annual financial framework.
In this context, it is essential to adopt measures for simplifying the mechanisms of structural and cohesion funds in order to set about improving the ability to draw on them in EU countries.
<D>
rapporteur. - Mr President, it is my pleasure to present the report on the problems and perspectives concerning European citizenship, which was adopted unanimously by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) last month.
European citizenship does not replace national citizenship.
It is an added bonus, giving EU citizens unique rights, notably the right to the freedom of movement, the right to consular protection and the right to petition Parliament and the European Ombudsman.
Parliament's report takes into consideration the Commission's fifth report on European citizenship, covering the period from 1 May 2004 to 30 June 2007.
This is a unique period.
Five years ago, on 1 May 2004, 10 new Member States joined the European Union.
The result of that accession, especially of states from Central and Eastern Europe, was a hitherto unseen scale of inter-Union migration.
The new citizens of the European Union embraced the rights granted to them, especially the right to free movement.
They benefited from the opportunity to be educated abroad and, in those countries which opened their labour markets, they undertook legal work.
The scale of migration, however, poses many challenges for the host countries.
These are challenges for both the central and local authorities.
Local authorities, particularly, where they are responsible for the provision of services such as housing, health care and primary and secondary education, are often confronted with the day-to-day problems of the new immigrants.
Much has been done to aid integration, as well as to help newcomers benefit from the same rights as citizens of their host countries.
Nevertheless, instances of discrimination remain.
Sometimes these are the result of legal loopholes and sometimes the result of a lack of knowledge of how to apply the law.
The LIBE Committee took a very constructive and practical approach in its work.
There was cross-party agreement that our priority was to highlight the problem areas and undertake steps to remedy them by providing central and local government in Member States with the necessary resources and support.
Our primary concern was that the individual citizen should not be hindered in any way from benefiting from his or her rights.
The second right I mentioned, that of consular protection, is still, unfortunately, poorly applied.
This fact was brought starkly to our attention when our own colleagues found themselves in a dramatic situation during the terrorist attacks in Mumbai.
If MEPs had problems exercising their right to consular protection in such an extreme situation, what chance does the average citizen have in more mundane circumstances?
Increasing citizens' awareness of their rights was a key issue raised throughout the report and a number of measures are suggested for greater awareness building.
If only 31% of citizens consider themselves to be well-informed about their rights, we still have a lot to do.
I trust the Commission will take into account Parliament's recommendations and will report back in its sixth report on the concrete progress made.
Finally, I would like to thank my shadow rapporteurs, the staff of the political groups and the LIBE Committee secretariat for their hard work.
A special word of thanks goes to all those who participated in the public hearing on the report, especially the representatives of the NGOs.
It is fitting that, in a report on citizenship, the citizen's voice, via the NGOs, was heeded in drawing up the final report.

Member of the Commission. - The negotiations on a free trade agreement with Korea are the most advanced of the EU's ongoing trade negotiations.
After two years of negotiations, we now have a comprehensive agreement within reach with the EU's fourth-largest trading partner outside Europe.
The free trade agreement with Korea would create new market access in many areas of interest to EU exporters.
By way of illustration: the agreement would swiftly eliminate EUR 1.6 billion of customs duties to the benefit of EU exporters; it would offer solid disciplines on non-tariff barriers in priority sectors such as the automotive, pharmaceutical, or consumer electrics sectors; it would provide significant new market access in services of special interest to EU service providers; it would offer the most ambitious package yet on intellectual property rights, government procurement, sustainable development and other rules issues; and it would foresee novel ways of involving civil society in the monitoring of how the free trade agreement is implemented, and protect our sensitivities with appropriate arrangements.
The free trade agreement would also present a useful point of reference for other negotiations.
Moreover, concluding that agreement now would demonstrate the commitment of both sides to open markets as one response to the current economic environment.
At the end of the eighth round of negotiations in March 2009, both sides made important technical progress at their level, but a certain number of difficult issues remained unresolved.
EU Trade Commissioner Ashton and Korean Trade Minister Kim subsequently met in London on 2 April 2009.
Despite intensive discussions, it was not possible to bridge gaps on the remaining issues, such as duty drawback and rules of origin.
The Commission is currently consulting on the best way forward.
<D>
in writing. - It is an encouraging report about Macedonia's progress.
The key to this progress is the renewed political consensus that has been achieved between different parties.
Such a consensus greatly helped my country, Estonia, to succeed in the EU accession.
Stabilising inter-ethnic relations, financial reforms and a successful fight against organised crime and corruption are just some landmarks of this progress.
While guaranteeing minorities their rights we expect that the enlarged autonomy will be used in a responsible way to consolidate the Macedonian state as a whole.
Macedonia should also be commended for keeping good-neighbourly relations both with Kosovo and Serbia.
Macedonian citizens' entry into the EU countries has become an urgent problem.
We need to apply as quickly as possible the same visa facilitation rules as those applying for Croatia.
Against the background of the impressive progress Macedonia has achieved I strongly suggest that the Commission could start accession negotiations already in 2008.
Finally, I appeal to our Greek friends to demonstrate good will and flexibility to reach a reasonable compromise that would enable Macedonia to free itself from the stigmatisation of Tito's communist federal state.
<D>
(RO) According to the study carried out by UNICEF and the 'Social Alternatives' association, in Romania, roughly 350 000 children have one parent working abroad, while 126 000 have both parents abroad.
These findings are worrying.
I believe that this situation could be improved through adopting the following measures:
1.
The national governments of the migrants' countries of origin and the governments of the countries absorbing this labour force, alongside the European Commission, should create a joint programme offering migrant workers the opportunity to access specific childcare services, the school and education system, as well as language courses.
These services should be accessible to every migrant worker segment.
2.
The European Commission, along with the governments of the states where the migrants are employed, should devise a strategy for offering certain facilities to employment bodies so that they can also offer employees a package of specific services providing migrant workers with the opportunity to take their children with them to the countries where they are working.
I feel that these measures would be conducive to the harmonious development and growth of these children as they, too, represent the future of Europe.
<D>
This is a report full of contradictions.
On the one hand, it uses very complimentary language about older people.
On the other hand, however, it puts forward basic measures that, in practice, put the rights of older people and of workers in general at risk.
Some examples of this are:
encouraging private pension systems, thus prioritising the financial sector and forgetting the serious consequences that these practices have already had, notably in the United States, where they left millions of pensioners destitute, forcing the state to intervene;
encouraging state intervention to increase part-time work and flexible work, brushing aside the consequences of these practices, such as the devaluing of labour, low wages, precarious work, and increased numbers of workers with incomes below the poverty line;
encouraging an increase in the age at which the pension can be claimed.
We voted against the report for all these reasons, although we acknowledge that it has certain positive aspects, which are, however, threatened by the neoliberal policies that the report advocates.
<D>
(NL) Madam President, the objective to emit 20% less greenhouse gases by 2020 has been safeguarded.
We should not kid ourselves, though.
This objective was already insufficient.
Science tells us that we should aim for a reduction of 25% and even 40%.
I regret that the system of auctioning has been undermined in the non-electricity sector.
In 2020, we will still be handing out 30% free emission rights, while the 100% auction will not be a reality until 2027.
This is sending a really bad signal to those who are to discuss the world climate agreement at Copenhagen, even though the best answer to CO2 leakage is, in actual fact, a worldwide agreement.
No worldwide agreement means that the auction system will be further undermined on account of the fact that free emission rights will continue to be awarded to 96% of the companies.
Lower proceeds from auction rights mean lower investment in sustainable energy and in research and development.
I should like to ask Mrs Doyle the following: do you have any insight into what the expected drop in profits of the auction will be now that this system has been totally undermined?
<D>
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) The political situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina is in a very delicate phase.
The verdict of the International Court of Justice in the case brought at the end of February by Bosnia-Herzegovina against Serbia and Montenegro on the application of the Convention on Genocide, brought to the surface the antagonisms which seemed to have been to some extent assuaged following the setting up of the Council of Ministers on 9 February.
The EU told the Bosnian authorities that it feared that the deterioration of the political climate in the country, the return of nationalist rhetoric and lack of political will to reach an agreement were endangering the reform process.
Bosnia-Herzegovina needs to operate effectively as a single economic and administrative space in order to ensure progress for its citizens and on the path towards EU membership.
As regards relations with the EU and the stabilisation and association process, the technical talks on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement were concluded in December, all Member States having given full support to the result of the technical negotiations on that agreement on 3 May.
The conclusion of the talks on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement is being held up by the lack of tangible progress on police reform.
The recently appointed High Representative/EU Special Representative, Miroslav Lajčak, who took up office at the beginning of July, set as his initial and immediate priorities, in line with the concerns of the Steering Board of the Peace Implementation Council and of the Council of the European Union, the creation of a constructive political climate and the restructuring of the police force.
In that context the High Representative/EU Special Representative is confident that progress can be achieved by the end of this month.
<D>
(SK) The EU-Russia Summit is rightly receiving a great deal of attention.
Taking into account Russia's important geopolitical standing and its enduring historical and cultural ties with Europe, I support the establishment of a strong political partnership between the EU and the Russian Federation.
This partnership should include mutual assistance in security issues, namely the fight against terrorism and organised crime, and overcoming the obstacles to free trade and travel.
However, we must not overlook the presence of several problematic aspects in the relationship between the Union and Russia.
In this regard, it is important for the EU to speak with one voice.
No Member State that takes the common foreign and security policy seriously should build its bilateral relations with Russia in such way that would damage the just interests of the Member States.
In areas concerning sensitive international issues, the EU and Russia should reach a consensus based on respect for international law and territorial integrity, for example in the case of Serbia and Kosovo.
To conclude, I would like to say that the EU should help Russia to develop and strengthen democracy, the rule of law and the protection of human rights.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to make use of one of our Rules of Procedure and make a personal statement relating to several comments by colleagues from other groups about my speech addressed to the President of the Commission.
I do not wish to go back over the debate here; I think it has become clear that there are both agreements and divergences.
Not even the Commission President's closing words can obscure the fact that there is a particular political message associated with his insistence on the Lisbon Strategy and the unaltered guidelines of the Lisbon Strategy.
His message is that these guidelines do not need altering in any way.
Our message is that they must be altered so as to improve social inclusion in Europe.
That is the difference!
(Applause)
However, Mr President, two things are unacceptable and I wish to make this perfectly plain.
If Mr Watson and, in particular, Mr Karas are trying to create the impression in this House that the slightest critical remark addressed to the Commission is sacrilegious because it creates a split between the European institutions, we cannot go along with that.
It is the European Parliament's duty to tell the Commission in what direction to go.
(Applause)
Furthermore, it is my duty as Chairman of this Group to point out that we perceive a social imbalance in Europe.
If you believe otherwise, that is your affair.
It is not, however, a criticism of the Commission to say that we would like it to alter its guidelines.
To turn this criticism into a disagreement between the institutions serves only one purpose, a political and ideological purpose.
I caution you: if you want to force the Commission into the Liberal and PPE-DE corner, if you create an impression that it is a Liberal/PPE-DE Commission, then you are making a mistake because you are portraying this Commission in ideological terms.
We do not want that; we stand by our policy of cooperation with the Commission.
You, not we, are pushing Mr Barroso into the right corner!
(Uproar and applause)
We want a policy of social justice, however.
That is what we are advocating here, and we will not be drawn into an institutional debate when we are conducting a political debate!
(Applause)
<D>
Mr President, the Commission communication states and I quote, 'The concept of animal health covers not only the absence of disease in animals, but also the critical relationship between the health of animals and their welfare.'
As rapporteur for the legislation on the maximum residue level of veterinary medicines in food I would like to emphasise that the key to this critical relationship is the adequate availability of authorised veterinary medicines, particularly for what in Europe we call Minor Use and Minor Species (MUMS).
And the Commission needs to address this issue urgently.
The availability of an adequate range of veterinary medicines to treat the wide variety of animal species in the European Community has been a growing challenge over the last two decades.
During this period considerable efforts have been made by various stakeholders to address the problems of medicines availability.
Despite these efforts, the situation has continued to deteriorate.
The lack of authorised medicines poses a real threat to animal health and welfare and the safety of consumers.
It also poses significant problems for animal owners, farmers, veterinarians and governments.
These effects include animal health and welfare problems if animals are untreated or treated with unauthorised or an unsuitable product, and zoonotic disease implications from untreated or inappropriately treated animals for animal owners and consumers.
There are also financial, legal and trade implications for the various stakeholders involved, whilst the lack of medicines may have negative effects on rural communities and agriculture generally.
Moreover, the current availability problem in the EU not only has implications for the health and welfare of our animals, the security of the Community's food supply, and public health, it also undermines the ability of the EU to meet the Lisbon Agenda and to reap the enormous benefits for European agriculture and aquaculture.
I therefore call on the Commissioner to commit to incorporating an urgent review of the Veterinary Medicines Directive and address the issue of medicines' availability in the strategy on animal health.
We should not wait until emerging diseases reach a crisis state; we must amend our veterinary medicine legislation swiftly as the consequences and cost of a major outbreak of a high-impact disease in the EU would far exceed the cost of action now to develop appropriate and adequately available...
(The President cut off the speaker.)
<D>
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, in every Member State of the EU there are groupings of people who are seen as different because of characteristics like ethnicity, language, how they dress, the music they play and how they worship.
When the people in that country are committed to respect for the innate dignity of every human person, these differences are seen as enriching, and people are valued.
In fact, when the dignity of the human person is valued, we do not view minorities in a negative way at all.
However, in many countries, this respect is weak or non-existent.
This leads to discrimination in which minorities are abused and relegated to the poorest of circumstances.
We insist in the Copenhagen Agreement that a country wishing to join the EU must have at least a minimally acceptable level of respect for everyone within its borders.
This principle falls down when we ignore these criteria and allow membership to countries where people are being marginalised and mistreated.
In Ireland, for instance, many children and adults with disabilities were institutionalised in the worst of circumstances at the time of our accession and for years after our membership.
Today, in spite of the introduction of the Copenhagen criteria, there exist similar terrible circumstances for vulnerable minorities in countries which have recently joined the EU or which plan to.
The Copenhagen criteria were clearly ignored in those cases, and the treatment of minorities was not considered an obstacle to membership.
This negates the purpose of the agreement.
If a country, in order to join the EU, must fulfil the Copenhagen criteria in respect of the treatment of its people, it should be possible to suspend membership when it does not.
<D>
In this communication, the Commission has sought greater rigour and uniformity in the criteria for apportioning aid to farmers in areas with natural handicaps.
It has also attempted to correct the uneven apportioning of compensatory payments among Member States resulting from differences in classification, especially of the so-called 'intermediate less-favoured areas (LFAs)'.
These payments are crucial to the preservation of employment and rural communities, to the continued use of farmland, and to biodiversity and the cultural landscape.
I am generally satisfied with the report and especially with the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development, which is attempting to safeguard the interests of the outermost regions, since the islands are excluded from the Commission's communication.
In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, it seems logical to me that, when identifying intermediate LFAs, the Member States be allowed to take into account not only biophysical criteria but also others, such as being an island or an outermost region.
It also seems important to me that any region that loses its status as an 'area with natural handicaps' should benefit from a transitional period, enabling it to lessen the impact of losing its subsidies.
We must now ensure that, in the general review of the common agricultural policy, the new aid schemes for farmers are thought out in a consistent way and that there is better coordination between agricultural policy and cohesion policy.
<D>
Mr President, the minutes of the last part-session mention your speech in which you talked about incidents that took place in Strasbourg in December.
Since that time, under Rule 147 of our revered Rules of Procedure, you have called before you 13 Members of this Parliament to face disciplinary action.
It seems to me that this has been done on a pretty arbitrary basis.
I doubt whether one of those that you have called - Ms Sinnott from our group - has ever shouted at anybody in her life.
Another of the Members that you called to appear in the headmaster's study - an Austrian Member - was actually in Frankfurt on the day, so he must have one hell of a voice, must he not?
Why only 13?
There were about 80 of us involved in these so-called disturbances.
In fact, at the Conference of Presidents' meeting, you yourself named me as being one of the causes of the trouble, so why am I not being punished?
I am Spartacus!
(Cries of 'I am Spartacus!' from members of the IND/DEM Group)
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (SK) I would like to say thank you for the work that has been done on this report by Mrs Figueiredo.
The report to some extent lists the problems facing women employed in various sectors of industry.
Some of the problems seem to be perennial problems, such as the gender pay gap, the inadequate representation of women on company boards of directors or the inadequate reconciliation of work and family life.
The report also brings up issues that are less frequently discussed, such as the insufficient attention given to specific requirements for the protection of women in the work place or the social problems that arise as a result of transfers of production to areas with lower production costs.
Some of the proposals in the report interfere with the principle of subsidiarity or lay down requirements that encroach on the competence of the social partners and the processes of collective bargaining.
The PPE-DE Group will not support these proposals.
Despite the fact that the report is more or less a summary of problems that are reasonably well known, it points at the fact that changes in these areas are slow, as can be seen, for example, in the development of differences between the salaries of men and women.
The research clearly indicates that the turning point comes when children arrive: from that point the careers of men and women take different directions.
Most difficult to break are the critical stereotypes, and this is the case even when we do not identify with them verbally any more.
The report also highlights the issue of the transferability and flexibility of pension rights, which is becoming more and more sensitive with the progressive unification of the labour market, and with the requirement for higher mobility of the workforce.
This, I think, is an issue that should be given appropriate attention.
<D>
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, honourable Member, the December 2005 European Council decision to grant candidate country status to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was recognition of that country's reform achievements.
The European Council stated that further steps towards EU membership would have to be considered firstly in the light of the debate on the enlargement strategy, as provided for by the conclusions of the 12 December 2005 Council, which concluded with the 'renewed consensus' on enlargement that was achieved at the 14-15 December 2006 European Council; secondly, of compliance by the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia with the Copenhagen criteria; thirdly, of the requirements of the Stabilisation and Association Process and the effective implementation of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement; and finally, of the need for further significant progress to respond to the other issues and criteria for membership included in the Commission's Opinion and implementation of the priorities in the European Partnership.
In its interim reports the Commission has examined developments in detail.
Following the assessment of the situation in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, as set out in the Commission report of 2006, in its session of 11-12 December 2006 the Council regretted that the pace of reforms observed had slowed down in 2006.
On 14-15 December 2006 the European Council reiterated that each country's progress towards the Union would continue to depend on its efforts to comply with the Copenhagen criteria and the conditionality of the Stabilisation and Association Process.
The Council called for the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to accelerate the pace of reforms in key areas and to implement the priorities identified in the European Partnership in order to move ahead in the accession process.
The fourth meeting of the Stabilisation and Association Council between the European Union and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia took place on 24 July last.
Particularly important among the messages set out in the Union's common position for the Stabilisation and Association Council was its insistence that stability and the regular functioning of democratic institutions were fundamental aspects of the political criteria essential for ensuring progress towards European integration.
Institutions such as the Government, Parliament and the President must function and cooperate effectively.
They must also play their differentiated roles and interact as laid down in the Constitution.
A constructive political climate must be established and maintained so that the country can concentrate on the reforms necessary to make progress towards the Union.
Further efforts must also be made to establish confidence between the ethnic communities at all levels.
The Union recalled that sustained implementation of the Ohrid Framework Agreement was a key element of the political criteria.
Every effort must be made to achieve the broadest possible political agreement on the associated reforms, in full compliance with the letter and spirit of the agreement.
The meeting also recalled the importance of making progress in the areas of justice and internal affairs, particularly in combating organised crime and corruption.
At the same time the Council also recalled that regional cooperation and good neighbourly relations were an essential part of the process of EU integration.
Finally, I wish to state that the Council is examining very carefully the Commission report published on 6 November, which will be the subject of conclusions at the General Affairs and External Relations Council in December next.
<D>
(PL) Madam President, Commissioner, I should like to begin by highlighting the importance of a strategic partnership between the European Union and Russia, and by stating my affection for the people of the Russian Federation, and indeed for all the nations of Russia.
I also wish to recognise Russia's achievements in terms of economic development and dealing with the social crisis.
A genuine strategic partnership demands a serious and honest approach to mutual relations, however.
The European Union has noted with concern the emergence of a new system of authority centred on President Putin.
This system threatens to permanently weaken liberal democracy in Russia itself.
It is also fanning the flames of neo-imperialism in Russian foreign policy.
In the documents it has prepared in advance of the EU-Russia Summit, Amnesty International draws attention to human rights violations in Russia.
The information provided by Amnesty relates to the infringement of human rights by governmental authorities in the northern Caucasus, notably in Chechnya and Ingushetia, to the worsening situation regarding freedom of expression and association, to the murder of journalists and to the increase in racially-motivated violence.
The Portuguese Presidency should raise the issues referred to by Amnesty International at the summit due to take place in Mafra on 26 October 2007.
Russian civil society, journalists and human rights activists need to be able to perceive the European Union as a guardian of fundamental rights and as an ally of a Russia that is democratic, liberal and open to the world.
<D>
(DA) Mr President, last Friday, the Irish voted 'no' to the Treaty of Lisbon, a poor copy of the Constitution to which France and the Netherlands also voted 'no'.
Nevertheless, the Commission President says that ratification is to continue.
We are told that one country's scepticism cannot put the brakes on development.
It is being made to look as though there is a problem with the Irish people.
But there is not.
The gulf is not between the Irish people and Europe; it is between the people and the Heads of State or Government of Europe.
The gulf is not between certain European countries and the rest of Europe.
France, the Netherlands and Ireland do not wish to put the brakes on development; they wish for development of a different kind.
Why is that so hard to understand?
As for Mr Schulz, I would say to him, 'shame on you'.
You compare what you call 'anti-Europeans' to fascists, but it is your rhetoric that is fascist.
You say that anti-Europeans ran up and down steps, went out canvassing.
It does not take much historical awareness to remember what was said about black people in the last century.
This is a disgrace!
Shame on you!
<D>
in writing. - (PT) The European Commission's proposal for a new European tourism policy presented in its Communication 'A renewed EU Tourism Policy: Towards a stronger partnership for European Tourism', which is the subject of this report, deserves our full support.
The report strengthens and supplements the provisions of the Commission's proposal, improving it by:
defending the harmonisation of quality standards for tourist accommodation in Europe and supporting the setting up of a European 'umbrella' for quality management systems;
protecting consumers, especially in the field of electronic tourism services (bookings and payments);
in the field of accessible tourism, taking due account not only of tourists with reduced mobility, but also of the accessibility problems affecting regions with specific natural or geographical characteristics, such as the outermost regions;
promoting sustainable tourism (economic, social, territorial, environmental and cultural);
strengthening passengers' rights in the field of air transport;
promoting destination 'Europe' and European tourist destinations.
I voted in favour for these reasons.
<D>
(HU) I congratulate Mrs Thomsen on her excellent report.
I agree with my fellow Members, and in particular with my colleague Mr Paasilinna, that we cannot be doctrinaire in matters relating to energy and that we must not think of renewable energy as a panacea in itself.
It will not solve Europe's problems on its own, but it is a very important step in the right direction.
In this regard we are all in agreement, and this point is masterfully underlined in Mrs Thomsen's report.
At the same time, however, several Members have made the point that technological progress is needed, because the new Members States and poorer Member States in particular perceive the use of solar power, wind power or - in the case of my country, where thermal springs abound - geothermal energy, to be extremely expensive.
I would ask Commissioner Piebalgs to urge the Commission to consider carefully how these technologies might be stimulated in Europe, perhaps also by means of tenders.
I do not mean simple technologies of the kind my fellow MEPs and I saw recently in Tibet when we were told that households were equipped with solar power.
We were reluctant to believe it, but it later transpired that they were referring to a very simple little plate capable of heating a jug of water in half an hour.
I am thinking of altogether more serious technologies.
As regards the agricultural sector, biofuels are very important, and I agree with Mrs Myller that we must not create a situation that pits biofuel production against the food industry and food production.
Let us also be sensible about bioethanol production, because sometimes producing bioethanol consumes more fossil fuel than it enables us to save.
I believe, therefore, that we need to take a diversified approach on this issue.
<D>
(FI) Mr President, Commissioners, Parliament will soon vote on three of the packages on the electricity and gas markets.
We have just approved the energy and climate package, but now there is a crisis we should organise a meeting on a bigger scale to include our partners.
We have the political capacity for that and we have need of cooperation.
I am also in favour of the notion of a work group set up under Article 175 that would report back to this Parliament, in May, for example.
The Russian and Ukrainian delegations should also be present.
It is a serious situation, as has been said.
Millions of people are freezing and factories are being shut.
By preventing gas from reaching the EU, Ukraine involved us in its problem.
Russia did the same when it cut off the EU gas section.
Gas is flowing, however, through other transit countries.
Thanks to speedy action on the part of the Union - and thanks go to the Commissioner for this - the meter readers are in place.
Russian gas has evidently started flowing to the Ukrainian network, but it is still not reaching the Union.
A peculiar situation has come about.
Both the EU and Russia are trying to construct energy pipelines in new areas: the EU outside Russia and Russia outside its former Soviet Republics.
It is work for those in the pipeline industry.
I would not be too inclined to impose sanctions on the parties in the row, however, and I do not think that sanctions are wise.
I am sceptical about using force, as it might hurt us more than it hurts them.
On the other hand, I would regard linking the Energy Charter Treaty to the future Partnership and Cooperation Agreement as being especially important.
One possibility would also be to set up a syndicate to administer the flow of gas through Ukraine: that would be a quick and urgent measure.
A neutral party also ought to be involved.
<D>
, in writing. - (RO) I welcome the position expressed by the European Commission through the voice of the European Commissioner Vladimír Špidla, of condemning the violence against the Roma people, wherever they are.
I also emphasize the need for a European strategy regarding the inclusion of the Roma population into the economic, social and political life of the European countries where they live.
In the absence of such a European strategy, each country will try to solve its problems regarding the Roma population sometimes by using policies and means that are incompatible with the fundamental human rights, the free movement of people in the European area.
Thus, I remind the European Commission that the European Parliament approved the Resolution for a European strategy on the Roma in November 2007.
My country, Romania, has made great efforts to include the Roma people.
The results have started to appear but the programmes in operation require more time in order to be able to assess their efficiency.
From these programmes, I mention in particular the training of specialists from among the Roma people for public administration and police, the decrease in school abandonment among the Roma children, as well as their integration into universities.
<D>
in writing. - (PT) This is a consultation procedure intended to result in agreement on the proposal to establish the European Criminal Records Information System (ECRIS), which will involve the computerised exchange of information between Member States.
The Commission confirms that the central objective is 'to reinforce the European area of security and justice' and that 'information about previous convictions shall circulate between judges and prosecutors as well as police authorities'.
As indicated, the 'objective presupposes the systematic exchange between the competent authorities of the Member States of information extracted from national criminal records in a way that would guarantee their common understanding and efficiency of such exchange'.
We believe that, when necessary, the transmission of information extracted from the criminal records of citizens of one Member State to another Member State must be effected on the basis of (bilateral) cooperation between the parties concerned.
However, among other issues whose scope and implications should be assessed, the report imposes obligations on the Member States which fall within the 'communitisation' of justice and home affairs to an extent that goes beyond the basis of cooperation between Member States that we recommend.
We obviously recognise the need for mechanisms allowing the reciprocal transmission of information extracted from criminal records between the Member States, but this must be assessed on a case-by-case basis and within a framework of cooperation.
<D>
Mr President, there was some controversy about the recasting procedure and my name was mentioned in this context.
I would like firstly to point out that the rapporteur who introduced this into our Rules of Procedure was Marylène Renault, not me.
Perhaps a word of explanation is necessary concerning the correct actions of the President of the Parliament.
We often have pieces of legislation amending for the 15th, 16th or 17th time some existing pieces of legislation.
That is very confusing for people who have to deal with this legislation.
We have, rightly, embarked on a procedure for codifying such legislation - putting it in a single, readable, manageable text.
We frequently have that before us and, because it does not change the substance, we have a simplified procedure for that.
However, when it comes to recasting, we have a difficulty.
There, the Commission is putting forward a proposal to change one element of a package of existing legislation and to simply codify the rest without changing it.
We have voluntarily restricted ourselves to tabling amendments of substance only to the part that the Commission is proposing to modify, and not to use the codification of the remaining part as an opportunity to reopen the substance.
Maybe we should, as has been suggested by one of our colleagues.
However, there would be a problem under the Treaty with regard to the demarcation of the right of initiative between us and the Commission.
It is certainly not, however, an issue where colleagues were right to complain about the actions of the President.
Under our existing Rules - which we gave ourselves as a Parliament and which we approved by an absolute majority of our Members - the correct procedure has been followed.
<D>
President of the Commission. - Mr President, on behalf of the Commission and on my own behalf, I want sincerely to congratulate you once again and wish you all the best in your term of office.
Your election symbolises not only the reunification of Europe, but also a Europe that is very much attached to the central values of freedom and solidarity.
Personally and institutionally I want to commit to close cooperation with you and with the European Parliament.
Parliament and the Commission are the two Community institutions par excellence at the heart of Community matters.
You and all the Members of this Parliament have been directly elected by our citizens and the Commission has the right and the duty to put European interests above any particular interest.
I believe that we have a special responsibility for the European project in full respect of the Treaties.
That is why I want to reiterate my willingness to work together to advance European parliamentary democracy.
(Applause)
<D>
Member of the Commission. - The fight against terrorism is, of course, one crucial element in the policy of the European Union.
The main actions are being taken by national services, police authorities and national politicians.
The European Union can support these initiatives, we can provide a certain legal framework, and we can make sure that the Charter of Fundamental Rights is respected.
We have some funding, we can provide support for victims and we can encourage further cooperation.
My feeling is that there is a lot of cooperation going on between the Member States on this.
Of course there is still the very sensitive issue of sharing intelligence.
This is based on trust - or lack of trust sometimes.
This has to be developed and it can only be done by harmonising and making sure that our European Union systems fully respect the rule of law and that they are trustworthy.
This is an area where the European Union can help.
In the Stockholm Programme and in the discussions leading to that, there was a clear willingness for Member States to strengthen cooperation - with each other, within the European Union, but also with third countries - in order to fight terrorism.
This, of course, always has to be done with full respect for fundamental rights, and the CIA rendition programme is not part of this.
<D>
in writing. - The extension of the Scientific and Technological Cooperation agreement between the EU and the USA is, beyond doubt, a positive aspect for European Research.
The overwhelming vote shows just this.
However, experience shows time and again that the most fruitful scientific collaborations are obtained when two researchers from two institutions collaborate on a commonly designed and jointly funded project.
Therefore, in order to bring more substance to the scientific cooperation with the US, I call upon the Commission to explicitly establish simple, project-oriented financing instruments of joint research grants between researchers in the US and the EU.
The explicit inclusion in the agreement of fields such as biomedicine, nanotechnology and space research is welcomed.
I would like to see included also other cutting edge fields, such as stem-cell research.
The fact that there are justified ethical issues related to some research fields should be a drive to a common reflection on these aspects rather than a barrier to common scientific progress.
Due, in particular, to the European Research Council grants, the EU is increasingly attractive for American researchers.
The EU now has instruments to seek higher and longer term incoming scientist mobility and must act so that the EU achieves a net brain-gain.
<D>
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, if we look at Greece at the moment, we can also learn something.
Austerity demands as well as the call to sell off the last of the state-owned silver will not rescue Greece.
However, everything is just continuing as before.
Before calling for commitments, yet more austerity measures and privatisations are being demanded.
At the same time, the attempt is still being made, by means of the European semester, to push this bankruptcy experience as a model for the Member States.
The whole situation has gone so far that we are considering the establishment of a privatisation agency based on the German Treuhand model.
Mr Lange, the German Treuhand agency did a number of positive things.
However, it also brought about massive de-industrialisation and a squandering of state assets.
The consequences can still be felt today.
I do not wish to represent this arrogantly as the mistakes of others, however.
Billions in additional aid for Greece without a clear change of course are nothing more than a safety net for the banks.
In this regard, we can also do without the voluntary participation of the private sector, so we are told.
In that case, I would say that this is a political belly flop.
Things will just carry on as before.
The only alternative in my view is a radical change in our financial and economic policy.
However, we lack the courage to do this.
The causes of the crisis are not being dealt with.
That is where the problem lies.
We lack the courage to bring about more democracy and transparency and to conduct less political activity behind closed doors.
This puts the European idea at risk and allows narrow-minded nationalism to gain ground.
I would ask that clear signals be sent out from the summit, but the signal must not be 'let us carry on as before'.
<D>
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, I should like to thank the Commission very much for all its efforts to ensure equal treatment for all European Union citizens at the US border.
I believe, however, that the negotiations concerning lifting the requirement for US visas provide a clear indication of the European Union's limitations.
Despite full support for the European Commission, notably on the part of the countries that acceded to the Union in 2004 and 2007, the talks have collapsed.
The United States is to sign bilateral visa agreements with each Member State in turn, once the country concerned complies only and exclusively with the criteria of US legislation in that regard.
Evidently, it is easy for the Commission to restrict the competences of the Member States.
Sometimes this is achieved by way of treaties, and at other times by precedent.
It is much harder to achieve success in relations with third countries.
Despite such significant support for the Commission's right to exclusive representation, certain Member States opted for individual negotiations.
My country is not one of them, but I have to say that I am not at all surprised that they acted as they did.
<D>
(RO) The strategy for promoting relations with Latin America has proved to be invaluable between the time of its launch and now.
This strategic partnership has added further consistency to relations between our regions and facilitated the funding of projects and programmes in excess of EUR 3 billion during the last 10 years.
Fortunately, countries in the Latin American region have been more successful so far in weathering the economic and financial crisis than certain developed countries.
However, the poverty level continues to remain extremely high or is even increasing among the disadvantaged section of the population due to the chronic nature of social polarisation and the political and institutional dysfunction in the region.
In Bolivia, for example, approximately 60% of the population live below the poverty line.
The figures reported for the proportion of the population living below the poverty line in Brazil and Argentina are 26% and 13.9% respectively.
This is why I strongly support the need for development aid to be focused on creating the institutional facilities in these countries, with the aim of levelling out the social disparities.
It is important for Mr Salafranca's report to promote the increase in dialogue in order to identify the methods for achieving the Millennium Development Goals.
However, I believe that it is vital for us to ensure that this strategy considers including civil society and non-governmental organisations in this dialogue and in the actions involved in implementing the strategy's objectives.
<D>
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, today, we are discussing an issue that is of the utmost importance to citizens.
Our Europe is a pleasant place where people enjoy increasing mobility.
It is a place where, increasingly, marriages are taking place between nationals of different countries or couples are moving to a different country, and of course this is a good thing and is one of the accomplishments of the European Union.
Unfortunately, there is also a drawback to this accomplishment, however, which is that these marriages often end in separation, and then there is the issue of the necessary divorce.
Current law is so unsatisfactory in some respects that a couple may be unable to find a competent judge or law for their divorce.
Naturally, this is a very unpleasant situation for these citizens, and we must come up with a solution and an answer.
This concerns people's lives, which are of the utmost importance.
I am pleased that the European Commission has tackled the subject, therefore, and I should like to reiterate straight away that there is to be no harmonisation of the law in this matter - indeed this is not permitted, and it is stated quite clearly in the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community that the law in such matters is the domain of Member States.
Yet we must ensure that there is transparency and that citizens are able to use this law.
After all, the legislation is very diverse.
There is Malta on the one hand, with no divorce at all, and Sweden on the other, where it is possible to obtain one within six months.
There is the Netherlands, where homosexual marriage is permitted, and Poland, where such a thing would be inconceivable.
These are all questions that arise and need to be answered.
We have done good work in the European Parliament and enjoyed constructive cooperation on this with the European Commission and also the Council.
The Council is key - it has to decide unanimously what will be done in this field in future.
Unfortunately, it is there that the problem now lies, but I shall return to this later.
The response that the European Commission has suggested to us is very positive.
Firstly, it would like to increase the choice of law under which a couple can divorce, provided both parties are in agreement - although it goes without saying that, if this is to be truly applicable, there must be a connection to the life, place of residence or place of marriage of the couple or to other aspects.
The question also arises as to what happens if a couple or just one of the partners wants a divorce and the couple cannot agree on the law to be applied.
In these circumstances, we take the view that there cannot be such great freedom of choice, as we need to ensure that there is a catalogue.
We cannot accept 'forum shopping'.
We cannot accept a situation in which the stronger partner chooses the law most favourable to him- or herself and the other is disadvantaged.
That is unacceptable.
This is why we have two different responses in these matters.
One particularly important principle quite clearly applies in both cases: we must ensure that both partners are very well informed about the consequences - both social and legal - of the choice of law.
Examples are custody matters, alimony and all such issues that are connected in this case too.
The parties concerned must be aware of this before they take a decision.
We are asking that judges verify that the partners are really aware of the consequences of their choice.
It is also important that we prevent the application of law from somewhere or other that is unacceptable in accordance with the principles of the European Union - for example Sharia law, Chinese law or whatever.
In this regard, too, we have come up with clear wording - particularly in Amendments 25 and 30, which I have attempted to reinforce with my Amendment 36 - namely stating that the respective law must be in keeping with the basic principles of the European Union or it cannot be applied.
This goes without saying as far as we are concerned.
The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has tabled a number of amendments that I find absolutely impossible to accept.
These impose a total limit on what we already have, and in addition would violate existing international law, for example that of the Hague Convention.
We cannot accept this.
We need further dialogue, and I hope that we do manage to find a solution to the problem by tomorrow.
At all events, I am much obliged to Mr Demetriou for his cooperation with me; it has been very constructive.
The Council has a major problem: it has to take a unanimous decision, and there is currently one Member State that is quite simply standing in the way of this unanimity.
That is why our committee tabled this oral question to the Council and the European Commission.
I consider it very regrettable that the Council is not present at this time to reply to this question.
The Minister has just left.
It is essential that we know what to do now, for our own sake and that of citizens and the future of the European Union.
The first question to the European Commission - I am pleased that you are here to reply, Mr Barrot - is as follows: do you intend to withdraw your proposal?
The second is: do you intend to submit a proposal to the Council to establish an enhanced cooperation procedure according to Article 11 of the EC Treaty and in compliance with Articles 43 and 45 of the Treaty?
I should have liked the Council to tell me whether it really intends to take this course, as that is the big question that arises.
<D>
(SL) Commissioner Füle and the rapporteur, Mrs Pack, are right in observing that we have not, in the main, received good news from Bosnia and Herzegovina over the past few years.
I think that 2010 should be a turning point for Bosnia.
First of all, it needs to avail itself of the preparedness of the European Union to liberalise visas.
Now it is up to the Bosnian politicians to do their bit.
Secondly, Bosnia and Herzegovina should take advantage of the positive conditions in its region.
Croatia and Serbia now have governments which are in favour of a united, whole and undivided Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Thirdly, the October elections will be a great opportunity for Bosnia and Herzegovina, offering its voters an opportunity to elect politicians who are prepared, and have the capacity, to move the country forward.
After the elections, we need a new agreement, a post-Dayton agreement, which will bring about a functioning state and government.
That is something that Bosnia and Herzegovina currently lacks.
In addition, this agreement must ensure the long-term existence of Bosnia and Herzegovina and it must contain international legal guarantees from the European Union, the United Nations and Croatia and Serbia.
We are prepared to do everything to get to that point.
<D>
in writing. - (PL) The issue of multilingualism and its preservation is one of the greatest challenges facing the Community.
The effects of the policy of multilingualism are far-reaching and obvious, but if erroneously applied the results can be pitiful.
One of Europe's virtues is its multicultural nature, which is also expressed in multilingualism.
It is at the same time a common obligation that is based on needs and the difficulty of re-forging multiculturalism into a clear strength which unites the Community, which will also have an impact beyond its borders and give Europe its rightful place in the world.
So the stakes are high.
A bad policy of multilingualism is based on favouring one or more languages and condemning the rest to marginalisation in all spheres of public activity.
Through its legislation and institutions, the European Union has huge opportunities to conduct a good language policy.
That makes its responsibility in this all the greater.
Mr Graça Moura's report does not solve all the problems associated with the right of individual European languages to co-exist and with the resulting privileges.
Aside from official languages, there are also a huge number of other languages spoken in Europe, and which are threatened with extinction to various degrees.
A feature of a good multilingual policy would be to protect these languages.
However, the report focuses more on learning the official languages than on implementing the idea of multilingualism.
What this issue needs is a sensible policy that is evolutionary in character, and I believe that a report in this direction should be accepted.
<D>
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, before the vote I, together with my colleagues from the Committee on International Trade, should like to say thank you for the successful work that has been done, which allows us to save time due to the absence of amendments.
This report should send a clear signal to the new government and the parliament in Ukraine that, for our part, we have done everything necessary to ensure that the negotiations for the free-trade area can take place.
We are trusting partners in this dialogue.
If there is a representative from Ukraine here today, please would he or she tell the national parliament that the European Parliament recommends voting without delay on the application by Ukraine for accession to the WTO, and ratifying this accession as soon as a decision has been made in Geneva.
For the mutual benefit of both the EU and Ukraine, I would ask you all now please to support this report.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
<D>
(SV) Mr President, there are two important things that characterise the debate here today.
The first is that an overwhelming majority of this Parliament wants to bring about a quick ceasefire.
The second is that there is overwhelming support for the requirement for all parties involved to accept the state of Israel's right to exist within peaceful borders.
This is the starting point that is important for the European Union.
It is important, because it is a tragedy that we are witnessing in Gaza.
Every life that is lost is a tragedy, whichever side of the border they are on.
Let us not think that this tragedy would be any less if those who deliberately kill civilians succeed in reaching even further in amongst civilians by means of rocket fire.
It is also a tragedy because it creates obstacles to the realisation of a Palestinian state and thus a peaceful solution.
It is a tragedy that is also befalling the international community, because what is happening now has not happened overnight, but has been built up through rearmament, through the smuggling of weapons and through rocket fire over a long period.
What is important for us to see is that this is not a tragedy that is built on conflict between Jews and Palestinians.
I strongly object to anyone trying to demonise a nation.
When I heard Mr Davies trying to lay the blame on a nation, I heard a tone that I do not think should be heard in this Parliament.
It is not a conflict between Palestinians and Jews, it is not a conflict between Israel and the Palestinian authority, it is a conflict between extremists and moderate forces in the region.
Let us support the moderate forces by making it clear to everyone who is pursuing hatred and wants to eliminate the state of Israel that they will not succeed.
If Europe sends out this message, we will also strengthen the moderate forces and lay a better foundation for peace.
<D>
(FR) The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:
report by André Brie, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council setting out the requirements for accreditation and market surveillance relating to the marketing of products - C6-0068/2007 -,
report by Christel Schaldemose, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and the Council on a common framework for the marketing of products - C6-0067/2007 -
and the report by Alexander Stubb, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council laying down procedures relating to the application of certain national technical rules to products lawfully marketed in another Member State and repealing Decision 3052/95/CE - C6-0065/2007 -,
as well as the following oral question:
oral question to the Commission by Arlene McCarthy, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, concerning safety marking on consumer products - B6-0009/2008).
<D>
Member of the Commission. - (CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission welcomes the report and motion for a resolution on equality between women and men in the European Union.
Acceptance of the report emphasises Parliament's undertaking with regard to equality between women and men and confirms Parliament's support for the Commission's approach.
I should like to thank above all the rapporteur, Mrs Garcia Pérez, for the support that she expressed for the steps taken by the European Commission in this field.
Equality between women and men is one of the fundamental values of the European Union.
It also represents an area in which Europe has often moved ahead of social developments.
In recent years it also has commenced important and ambitious initiatives.
Acceptance of the plan to achieve equal status between women and men emphasises the Commission's willingness to use all means to bring Europe closer to real equality between women and men in all areas.
Furthermore, the Commission notes that Parliament's motion for a resolution emphasises certain topics which are included in the plan's priorities.
This involves in particular the position of women in the labour market, the work-life balance, a balanced accession to leading positions and also the fight to stop violence against women.
This approach complies with the Commission's policy in this field and includes topics which were emphasised in the report for 2008.
Although the progress made in the field of equality between women and men is obvious, we are still faced with important tasks.
We must continue with our efforts and strengthen the legal base.
The Commission shares the rapporteur's view that a central role is played in the achievement of equality between women and men by the work-life balance.
We are well aware that it is mostly women who take responsibility for the family and the home.
This is why women, more often than men, have to interrupt their studies and careers, very often not returning to them.
In order to increase female employment, therefore, it is vital to have access to high-quality and affordable childcare.
The Commission will be presenting a report on developments in this field in the weeks to come.
Furthermore, in 2006 and 2007 the Commission consulted representatives of workers and employers on the topic of work-life balance.
In July 2008, they indicated their intention to negotiate on parental leave.
The Commission is not at the moment submitting any proposals on this topic.
The Commission intends in the near future to present a package of initiatives relating to the work-life balance, in particular a report on childcare, a draft directive amending the Directive on maternity leave and a draft directive amending the 1986 Directive on 'assisting spouses'.
The current situation of assisting spouses in agriculture and also in other sectors where there are family businesses is unacceptable.
It is not acceptable for people working regularly for family businesses in some countries not to have any right to social security and to find themselves in a position of great need in the event of divorce, death of the breadwinner or financial difficulty.
A policy of equality is of fundamental importance in preventing and combating violence committed against the opposite sex, since this is based on the imbalance of strength between men and women.
Effective measures against violence based on gender, on the other hand, make a contribution to protecting women's rights in society and supporting equality.
Violence against women is unacceptable.
Rape, sexual abuse of girls, trafficking in women for the purpose of sexual or labour exploitation, domestic violence, workplace harassment, and also traditional or disfiguring practices - such as, for example, mutilation of the sex organs - impair the health, freedom, dignity and physical and emotional inviolability of women.
Our interventions must be thorough and exceptionally effective, in particular in cases where violence against women is committed by international organised crime, as in the case of people trafficking.
For this reason, the Commission considers that, as part of its working programme for 2009, it will revise and rewrite the legislation relating to people trafficking, exploitation and sexual abuse of children, which is a terrible crime committed mainly against girls.
In conclusion, I should like to say that equality policy plays a fundamental role in changing thinking and behaviour.
It is therefore key in ensuring not only legal equality but also real equality between women and men.
The Commission therefore welcomes the support given to it by the European Parliament through this motion for a resolution.
<D>
author. - Mr President, the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is profoundly traumatising for Congolese society.
Amongst other atrocities, rape has been used for many years as a weapon of war and tens of thousands of women and girls are suffering.
Our empathy is not enough.
Without any doubt, there is an ongoing genocide against women in Congo, and we can no longer afford to turn a blind eye to this dreadful situation.
Words are not enough to describe the horrors these women have to endure.
Undoubtedly, the clashes of the rebels in the eastern provinces will bring more and more violence, including sexual violence.
How many women and girls have to die, be gang-raped, butchered, enslaved, contaminated with HIV, rejected by their communities, until we decide at am international level to engage seriously and with a long-term view on this subject?
There should be no tolerance for the sexual violence against girls and women.
The impunity of the perpetrators must come to an end and the rule of law has to be restored in the eastern provinces of the DRC.
We all have to acknowledge that this situation demands a multifaceted approach.
Peace needs to be achieved, the rule of law established and society saved from the poverty trap in the eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of Congo.
This implies that the exploitation of Congolese natural resources must follow the rule of law as well.
<D>
author. - Mr President, in 1960, British and Italian Somaliland looked forward to their dream of independence.
But that dream very soon turned sour and I remember as chairman in the British Parliament of the British Somali Group, having this string of refugees coming to tell us first about the authoritarian regime in that country and then, of course, about the factional fighting and the anarchy.
Somaliland still has a degree of independence and stability, as does Puntland.
But Mogadishu is a name synonymous with violence, murder, riots, hunger and a failed economy.
So what do we do?
Well, we cannot do that much.
Certainly not individually; probably not as Europe.
But we can work with other international players to put pressure on the players inside the country to agree to halt the ongoing conflict, to halt violence, to stop the violations of international human rights and to work towards peace.
We have got to persuade them to allow humanitarian assistance to reach those most in need, and we have, perhaps, to help them ensure the safety of those humanitarian aid workers.
We must appeal to those outside who can help.
We appeal to Kenya to allow Somali refugees to have access to the El Wak border and the right to assistance in that country.
We appeal to everyone, as has been referred to already, to ensure that we have the embargo on the sale of arms to that country.
We insist that those who have committed war crimes must be brought to justice and, where appropriate, to the International Criminal Court.
And, of course, we welcome the UN Security Council's resolution of May calling for the deployment of 28 000 troops as a peacekeeping force; more realistically, perhaps, we urge that AMISOM be mandated to take protective action.
We need action: not just resolution, but we need international action.
<D>
(DE) Madam President, despite all the criticism that people like me have expressed about particular deplorable states of affairs in the European Union, we were always very much in favour of the introduction of the euro.
Back when I was a correspondent for der Spiegel magazine, I saw speculation against particular currencies and the euro has protected us against that.
However, what we are seeing now is a massive loss of confidence by savers and, in particular, by citizens in countries in which the budgetary criteria have, to a certain extent, been met.
My question to you, Commissioner, is this: has it not become abundantly clear to you over the last few years that Greece is deceiving us?
There have been abundant rumours in this regard.
However, we knew that Greece did not actually fully meet the criteria at the start.
Why has this not been monitored more intensively?
How do you intend to deal with such a difficult issue in future?
I ask this with my own country, Austria, entirely in mind, where similar rumours are currently circulating in the same way they did about Greece a few years ago.
<D>
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the constant delay and your answer, Commissioner, are not acceptable.
Time is running out.
Urban traffic plays a key role in the context of climate change.
It is responsible for about 70% of all greenhouse gases in cities.
The EU will only succeed in achieving its own climate protection goals if it changes its transport policy.
The greatest potential lies in the cities because 90% of car journeys made in cities are less than six kilometres long - distances which could easily be covered by taking the train or bus or by cycling or walking.
I hope that the Commission has used the delay to consider how the EU can effectively help governments and cities.
There is actually no European added value when the report is as vague and non-binding as the Green Paper and the Rack Report.
We Greens request that EU Cofinancing be redesigned to be environmentally friendly.
To date, 60% of EU money has been used for road-building projects, while only 20% goes into public transport and rail.
We want at least 40% for rail as decided by Parliament in my report on the first rail package.
Secondly, we only want to grant EU money if cities can present a sustainable mobility plan.
Thirdly, we want to increase road safety with a general speed limit of 30 km/h with the possibility for cities to set higher speeds for specific roads independently.
That is not only good for the climate, it will also reduce accidents because 40 000 people die on Europe's roads every year.
<D>
(SV) Mr President, let me begin by thanking all parties for the resolution.
Today no EU country is free of right-wing extremism, not even my own country, Sweden.
In the last local elections in 2006 Sverigedemokraterna (the Sweden Democrats) won seats in two thirds of municipalities.
It might be suspected that their next targets are the elections to the European Parliament in 2009 and the Swedish parliamentary elections in 2010.
We Swedish parliamentarians need help in making that more difficult, precisely as others need help in their countries in stopping the spread of right-wing extremism, which is on the increase throughout Europe.
Europe needs democratic parties whose programmes reach out to all, not just a few.
In the 2006 elections the slogan of the Swedish Social Democrats was 'Everyone is included', and it becomes even more relevant in this debate, since the parties and groups we are discussing have programmes which do not respect the EU's fundamental values and the equal value of all human beings.
For me, as a member of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, the approach to questions of asylum and refugee policy is absolutely crucial.
The right-wing extremist parties oppose both a more open Europe and the development of the EU.
Instead they advocate nations with closed borders.
It is a threat which I observe in Sweden and, along with all of you, throughout the EU.
I would like to make one more comment on the resolution.
The propaganda which extremist groups spread among children and young people takes the form of white power music.
The media and communications are the tool used, and it circumvents school, the family, further education and our political values.
It is important that we, as elected representatives, now take charge of the debate.
We must do that as of now and continue up to the European Parliament elections in 2009.
Let us applaud the resolution.
(Applause)
<D>
in writing. - (PL) I voted in favour of adoption of the report by Mr Gierek on the Research Fund for Coal and Steel.
Pursuant to the Council's guidelines, after operating for five years the Research Fund for Coal and Steel was reviewed this year.
The review focused on efficient use of energy materials and environmental protection.
It should be emphasised that one of the Fund's great advantages is that it can be used as a source of supplementary finance for research not covered by the Seventh Framework Programme.
In addition, pursuant also to the European Commission's stance, the Fund should continue to operate, because steel is still one of the principal raw materials for the machinery and construction industries, and these sectors require constant investment in research.
The Fund will also facilitate better use of coal on the energy market, which will make a significant contribution to the European Union's energy security.
It should, however, be remembered that extraction of this raw material requires ongoing exploratory surveys.
Another important issue is the introduction of the principle of gender equality into the research teams.
This will make a positive contribution to increasing the involvement of women in the area.
<D>
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to begin by thanking Mr Grosch, the shadow rapporteur, with whom I worked, along with the technical staff from the Committee on Transport and Tourism and the European Socialists Group, as well as my colleagues in the Commission and the Commission's staff, not to mention yourself, Commissioner, and the Presidency of the European Council which I have enjoyed very close cooperation with.
I would like to remind you that in June 2007 the European Commission proposed amending the regulation on access to the road transport business.
The proposals for the amendment have come about from the experience gained following the application of European Commission Directive 96/26.
This has resulted in some of the legislative provisions being reworded with the aim of ensuring more consistent application, by using a legal act in the form of a regulation.
Here we are now roughly two years later, having a final vote on this document which has a direct impact on approximately 800 000 European enterprises and around 4.5 million jobs.
Our common objectives are as follows: to improve road safety, reduce bureaucracy, simplify procedures and provide predictability and certainty for road transport operators.
I hope that this compromise which we have reached will develop the road transport market.
I thank fellow Members once again for their cooperation.
<D>
(FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, since 2001, developing countries have been negotiating a round within the WTO described as the development round.
Now in the face of a sudden and devastating food crisis, alerting the world to the urgent need to find a long-term global and balanced solution, these countries expect a clear response from us to guarantee their food security.
I would like to confirm that, if the round continued to be about market access at any price, we would not achieve our objective.
We also know that, the more we postpone the signing of a development agreement, the further away the prospects are of achieving the Millennium Development Goals, and unfortunately we are already way behind schedule.
Faced with this crisis situation, we ask that a political solution be found as soon as possible to the special safeguard mechanism in order to produce an effective protection tool for small producers in poor countries.
This is an essential step before continuing negotiations on other aspects, and I hope that the recent resumption of talks on agriculture and non-agricultural market access (NAMA) will allow progress in this respect.
Before I finish, I would like to describe the amendments tabled to the joint resolution.
The Socialist Group in the European Parliament will of course ask us to vote in favour of Amendment 2, which is absolutely essential for increasing the rights of Parliament in international trade.
We also support the amendments tabled by The Greens/European Free Alliance, but we cannot accept the amendment tabled by the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, for we believe that it is not appropriate, in this resolution on multilateral negotiations, to call for new regional bilateral agreements to be signed, since we know that these are usually negotiated at the expense of the weakest.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, CO2 is not poisonous, nor is it explosive, but CO2 does have one unpleasant property: if it gets into the atmosphere in large quantities, our climate changes, which is why carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology is an important bridging technology.
In this respect, Mr Hoppenstedt is right; it is a bridge for the next 50 to 80 years.
It is not the non plus ultra, but it is one part of the solution to our problems.
I think we have found a good compromise, at least in terms of the link to the emission trading scheme.
The emission trading scheme guarantees that resources will be made available for CCS, and CCS also guarantees that we shall make headway in reducing CO2 and shall be able to achieve our targets.
I think that, alongside efforts by industry to construct this demonstration plant, the Member States need to make an effort to get national legislation transposing this directive under way.
Above all, we all need to pursue clarity, for public opinion and for industry, in order to ally people's fears about CCS.
CCS is not a dangerous technology; it is a helpful technology.
<D>
rapporteur. - (NL) Madam President, I am pleased that today speakers have discussed not only unbundling but also consumer rights.
Looking ahead to Thursday's vote, I should just like to request support for three amendments seeking to further improve these consumer rights and to inform consumers regularly about their consumption.
I do not think it too much to ask that this be done four times a year.
There is also the concept of smart meters and the imposition of a deadline for their roll-out, namely 10 years after the entry into force of the Directive.
Finally, on the subject of the national action plans to tackle energy poverty, I should just like to say to Mr Vidal-Quadras that we are only citing the social tariffs as an example to Member States of a possible instrument.
These are three amendments for which we request support in order to improve consumer rights.
To conclude, Madam President, I am disappointed with the Commissioner's response, in which he leaves the areas of consumer rights to Member States in the name of subsidiarity.
I would say to him that we are moving towards a European market in energy, and so tomorrow British citizens will be faced with a German supplier.
As I see it, this European market in energy means that we must also be able to give consumers a European answer.
<D>
Mr President, 2008 is set to be a decisive year for us in the European Union and, indeed, the Lisbon Treaty will potentially shape the Union's future irrevocably.
Proponents of the Treaty here today state that its primary purpose is to streamline decision-making powers.
That is not true.
This in fact is again an ambitious political strategy to move decision-making in critical areas away from Member States to the institutions of the EU, institutions that remain beyond the democratic reach of citizens.
Provisions relating to national parliaments, citizens' petitions and subsidiarity are merely tokenistic.
In Ireland, we will have an opportunity to vote on this Treaty, and I am sure our Taoiseach must envy French and Dutch leaders who can ignore the views of their citizens or other leaders who are not obliged to put the Treaty to their people.
In Ireland our government pretends that our reputation as good Europeans requires acceptance of this Treaty.
In fact the values of democracy, of social inclusion, of building peace, to which the EU is rhetorically committed, are best protected by good Europeans rejecting this bad Treaty.
Irish people do not need the great and good of Europe telling us there is no alternative to Lisbon.
I should like to say to those EU leaders who have taken an interest in our country: if you are so keen to be involved in a referendum campaign, organise one in your own country.
If not, then let us get on with our debate and take our democratic decision.
<D>
in writing. - (SV) The resolution on rising food prices in the world could have been a valuable contribution to the current debate on the EU's agricultural policy and its consequences.
Yet the result was a disappointment.
In the first part it is noted that the trend is towards increased regulation and renewed stockpiling - despite the fact that the high food prices have for the first time in years made agriculture a truly lucrative sector.
The second part talks about 'the right to food' in the Third World and the importance of prioritising food over fuel production.
At the same time, the final result of the voting was scattered on all sides as regards the advantages and disadvantages of biofuels!
Politics consists of conflicts over objectives and the main task of a politician is to strike a balance and rank them in order of priority.
This resolution did not achieve that.
I therefore abstained.
<D>
in writing. - The European Parliamentary Labour Party welcomes this Parliament report.
When the Taliban fell in 2001 there were only 900,000 children in school.
That figure is now 6 million and rising.
Five million refugees have returned home and 82% of the population have access to healthcare, nine times the figure in 2002.
However we share Parliament's deep concern about continued problems on security, and that without security there can be no return to normal life.
However, we abstained on the report as a number of points do not reflect the reality of the situation in Afghanistan.
Recital D is factually incorrect as deployment of new NATO troops to Afghanistan is continuing with both the UK and Germany recently announcing increased levels.
Also we do not agree with the situation on opium production levels described in paragraph 32.
The report seems to ignore the hard work being done by the Afghanistan Government through their long term National Drug Control Strategy, and which has led to progress in cutting the number of provinces that harvest opium poppies.
Finally, we want to support continued cooperation with Afghan law enforcement bodies as part of the European Union's continued support for transitional justice and security sector reform in the country.
<D>
(EL) The European Parliament has to give a clear message about both sides of this discussion today: firstly, concerning the rationale of the financial system that we have to build for the future and secondly, concerning our initial reaction to the recovery plan which was put forward by the Commission on 26 November.
On the first of those, there is no doubt that the Commission has clearly got the message that the era of self-regulation or non-regulation is well and truly over.
If there are some within the Commission or even within this Parliament who were under the impression that the real economy could be built on the rationale of no rules, then current events would have proved them wrong.
It took us some time but now we understand.
I do not think that Commissioner Almunia is to blame.
Others may have exposed the Commission to this rationale but now it is too late.
Now the new economic order must be built on a rationale that is governed by rules, rules and more rules.
The second part of the recovery plan, which was put forward by the Commission last week, does contain some positive points, and we must recognise that the Commission has managed (and I know how hard that is) to reconcile differences of opinion and offer governments an interconnected framework for actions with a common rationale.
Now I can hear people on the left and right saying such things as, 'we wanted it differently,' 'it might be too expensive,' or 'we do not like it'.
These are the same people that, if the Commission had done nothing, would have said 'the Commission is not doing anything,' 'we are waiting for the Commission to give us a blueprint'.
Therefore I believe that the second message we must send to the Commissioner is that the rationale behind this package is the right one, it is going to help governments and it may well be a life raft on which the real economy can survive during the first days of a crisis.
Thank you.
<D>
(HU) I would like to make an exception and not talk about the Treaty of Lisbon.
Rather, I would like to say on the outcome of the European Council regarding the economic, financial and social chapter that we are, in one respect, delighted to see that the signs of financial stabilisation feature in this document too.
This is how we see the situation ourselves, but in the meantime, it is also clear that people's reserves are dwindling in Europe.
Companies are finding it difficult to obtain financial assistance and bank loans, while unemployment is on the rise.
This is also mentioned in this document.
I think it is important to emphasise that economic growth cannot be sustainable nor can we talk about Europe emerging from the crisis stronger than it was until we can clearly guarantee that the current level of social cohesion is not only maintained but strengthened and until we can increase employment and prevent social exclusion.
The methods we have for coordinating social policy, based on an open approach, are fairly ineffective.
We must improve our coordination methods.
In fact, we need more effective tools.
Social cohesion and the achievements of a social Europe are those factors which people consider the most important.
It is our shared responsibility to highlight this fact.
<D>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Commissioner; she has given us important assurances, including the fact that the Commission and Commissioner Barrot intend to find a legally binding definition for 'grooming', a common definition for all Member States.
In my view this is undoubtedly a very important objective.
I believe that this programme, clearly, cannot solve all the problems, not least because it is just a programme, it has legal limitations and budgetary restrictions, obviously.
That said, it is evident from the debate that the European Parliament wishes to be active in combating harmful online content.
The aim for the future is also to improve the coordination of action against this content at European level, making available best practices, measures that have enjoyed the most success, and sharing information and methods.
In my opinion, international cooperation must be continually increased in this sector that, as other Members have said, is a sector that knows no borders.
We therefore need to move towards sharing data and information in real time.
Parliament wants to remain at the forefront in this area.
We have many proposals, some of which have been mentioned by my fellow Members: the idea of a 'child-friendly' mark, the role of 'hotlines' and of police forces working to prevent and combat online abuse, but also the need to implement initiatives in the area of self-regulation by mobile phone operators and service providers.
In addition, I believe that we need to work towards tracing financial transactions linked to the exchange of images of child pornography.
I share the Commissioner's view: information and education campaigns involving not only children but also adults, parents and teachers, not for the purpose of criminalising new technologies - because they are vitally important - are essential for European children.
<D>
(PT) The experiment at regional integration in Mercosur has essentially been a success both at the economic and the political level.
Mercosur's contribution to democratic consolidation in the region and growth in the volume of trade within that bloc are unquestionable facts.
It is true that at the moment the negotiations between the EU and Mercosur are at an impasse because of the wait for commitments and agreements to emerge from the Doha Round that may serve as a new starting point for our bilateral trade negotiations.
Although I do not wish to appear too pessimistic, we run the risk that the Doha Round will merely result in our losing precious time.
The EU should contribute to the success of South American regional integration by putting all its efforts into the success of the negotiations between the two blocs.
Our relationship must be much more extensive than a mere free trade agreement.
Under discussion here is a global agreement that goes much further than figures and quantities of goods to be traded.
The association agreement includes cooperation and political dialogue, which are fundamental pillars for our future relationship.
No one doubts nowadays that the European Union needs Ibero-America and its great instrument, Mercosur, in order to achieve its objective of building a more balanced and multilateral international order.
The joint statement by the President of the European Commission and the President-in-Office of Mercosur, the President of Uruguay, Tabaré Vásquez, following the meeting on 19 September promising a joint public statement by the two blocs by the end of the year on the environment and climate change is an important example of that political collaboration.
Mercosur offers great promise as far as economic integration and making South America politically stronger on the international stage are concerned, but that does not mean we can overlook or pretend not to see what is before us - the incontrovertible political presence of Brazil, by sheer force of the facts, as the leading power in South America.
Brazil is the soul and driving force of Mercosur.
With its 190 million inhabitants and an economy representing approximately 75% of Mercosur's GDP, Brazil is the only BRIC country with which the Union had not held a summit until now.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is absurd to think that the European Union can teach Brazil anything about the importance of Mercosur or appoint itself Mercosur's champion before Brazil.
That is absolutely ridiculous.
Similarly, Brazil is the only Mercosur member country aspiring for a place on the UN Security Council, which it merits and which will give the whole of Latin America a voice within that important body.
<D>
in writing. - (PT) A response is urgently needed to the problem of a lack of information on deep-sea fish stocks and also data on catches and fishing effort and their implications for the populations of each species.
Just as this information is vital for producing studies and scientific opinions, it can also decisively contribute to the establishment of adequate fishing management measures.
We therefore feel it is essential that this forms one of the priorities of the Member States' action in terms of improving the collection and availability of reliable data, including the analysis of reasons for non-application or less correct application of the management measures in force, as mentioned in the report.
The possibility raised by international organisations of some of these species suffering from overfishing reinforces this need.
The aim must be to adopt a precautionary approach which tries to balance fishing opportunities with stock stability.
We therefore support the amendments tabled.
We consider that the measures to be adopted must take account of the specific nature of each species, the fishing area and the fishing gear used, particularly those which are more selective and have less impact on the seabed.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, I should like to start by voicing my thanks for the objectivity of this debate; it is certainly more objective than the extraordinary meeting held by the Committee on Foreign Affairs on 20 August.
Let us be blunt.
Georgian President Saakashvili ordered a military offensive.
That was what actually sparked off the war and triggered a spiral of violence.
If we ignore that fact, we deny the real cause of the war.
The attacks, especially on the civilian population in Tskhinvali, are to be roundly condemned, along with the military response, especially the military response by Russia and the attacks on the civilian population, particularly in the town of Gori.
Both sides have deployed cluster bombs in this conflict as well, which is unacceptable.
International humanitarian law and the law of war have been clearly violated by both sides in this conflict.
The message which I have heard very often, however, is that Russia is solely responsible for the current situation.
That is not the case, and I am pleased that the French Council Presidency has adopted a more balanced position on this point.
My own position remains unchanged: recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia are comparable, under international law, with recognition of Kosovo.
The Western countries recognised Kosovo and really opened Pandora's box.
The West, NATO and the European Union are heavily implicated in the escalation of this conflict and the war in Georgia: the US redeployed Georgian troops from Iraq to Georgia and a number of Western countries - NATO countries, EU countries - have played a role in arming Georgia.
Even Israel has armed Georgia, and the arrival of NATO warships in the Black Sea is not necessarily a sign of peace.
We know that, in this war, geopolitical interests are also at stake; I need only mention the oil pipelines in this context.
The conflict should not be used as a pretext to drive forward the militarisation of the European Union.
The EU has been successful as a non-military actor.
If we now take sides, the EU will lose its credibility as a mediator.
We are on the brink of a Cold War, and as for what lies ahead, well, it could go either way.
Today is 1 September, a day which is celebrated as an Anti-War Day.
We should be mindful of that: war is unacceptable and should never be supported, directly or indirectly, by countries in the European Union.
<D>
On 30 January 2000, the dam surrounding the tailing pond containing waste from the company Aurul in Baia Mare, Romania, cracked, allowing approximately 100 000 cubic metres of contaminated water, containing 100 tonnes of cyanide and heavy metals, to spill out.
This spill resulted in the drinking water supply being cut off to 2.5 million people in three countries.
The River Somes had cyanide concentrations 700 times above permitted levels.
Aquatic life was completely destroyed over a distance of several hundred kilometres.
We must not forget the details of this disaster, which has become synonymous internationally with pollution.
It highlights to us that, in spite of legislation and controls, such accidents can occur at any time.
Hazardous substances have no place in mining if we want to prevent disasters.
The intention at Roşia Montană is to construct the largest surface gold mine in Europe, based on the use of cyanides.
What will the consequences be then?
The destruction of the environment, the disappearance of the village, the displacement of the inhabitants, churches and cemeteries and a death warrant for the priceless remains dating back to Roman and pre-Roman times.
History teaches us lessons.
It is incumbent upon all of us to learn them.
It is absolutely imperative that we impose a total ban on the use of cyanide in mining within the EU in order to avert tragedies affecting people and the environment.
<D>
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PL) Mr President, Commissioner, the report by Ms Hall, whom I congratulate on her complex approach, draws attention to a significant delay on the part of the Member States and the Commission in implementing existing legislation in this area.
The efficient use of primary energy depends on improved efficiency in converting it into electricity, on the introduction of standards for minimum energy end consumption, on the widespread thermo-modernisation of buildings, on the widespread introduction of co-generation by eliminating administrative barriers, and on the reduction of energy transfer losses and losses due to friction.
The report also highlights the global scale of the problem and the need to cut greenhouse gas emissions.
Housing accounts for some 40% of all energy consumption, and thermo-modernisation could reduce its intake by at least half, i.e. 20% of all energy consumed.
Furthermore, co-generation, together with the reduction of energy transfer losses, can double energy efficiency.
Taken together, the potential savings in primary energy achievable through the use of known technologies, namely thermo-modernisation and co-generation, can be estimated at around 25% to 30%, with an equivalent reduction in CO2 emissions.
The paradox, however, is that the implementation of these plans may be held back by later European Commission regulations, specifically restrictive CO2 emission standards which, in the case of older power stations and heating plants in need of modernisation, raise production costs and reduce the possibilities for modernisation investments.
Another aspect of the global nature of the problem is the need to draw up common standards of environmental suitability applicable both within the European Union and in its partner countries.
That is a precondition both for beneficial cooperation and for fair competition on world markets.
<D>
in writing. - (IT) On several occasions I have spoken out in favour on issues relating to multilingualism, so I think my position is quite clear.
The linguistic and cultural diversity of the European Union is a huge competitive advantage.
In my opinion it is vital to promote in practice programmes for language teaching and cultural and student exchanges, both within and outside the EU, as I did when I supported the Erasmus Mundus programme.
Multilingualism is essential for effective communication and represents a means of facilitating comprehension between individuals and, hence, acceptance of diversity and minorities.
Linguistic diversity also has a significant impact on the daily lives of EU citizens due to media penetration, increasing mobility, migration and advancing cultural globalisation.
The acquisition of a diverse range of language skills is of the greatest importance for all EU citizens, since it enables them to derive full economic, social and cultural benefit from freedom of movement within the Union and from the Union's relations with third countries.
Language is in fact a fundamental factor in social inclusion.
Europe's linguistic diversity therefore represents a vital cultural asset, and it would be a mistake for the European Union to limit itself to just one main language.
<D>
in writing. - (PT) Every year we are confronted with this exercise in hypocrisy of the European Parliament on human rights in the world.
Obviously the report contains points which we support.
However, in essence, it is a perfect example of the instrumentalisation of human rights and their unacceptable use as a political weapon in favour of the interests of the EU's major powers, and their large financial and economic groups, and against those people who reject their dictates.
As such, there is a total absence of any references to and denouncements of the flagrant violations of human rights in Palestine, Iraq, Afghanistan, occupied Cyprus or the Western Sahara, as perpetrated by EU countries and/or their allies such as the US, Israel, Turkey or Morocco.
As such, there is once again an attempt to dissociate human rights, by subordinating them to economic and social rights.
The defence of human rights - including the fact that they are indivisible and cannot be ranked - and their status as a prerequisite for respect for the rights of people and for genuine social justice, peace, freedom and democracy must form the framework of our political action.
For us they are about defending the rights of people, not exercises in hypocrisy.
<D>
(NL) Mr President, the rapporteur, Mrs Lambert, is right when she says that the Dublin objectives for asylum shopping have never been achieved; quite the reverse, in fact.
That is true.
She is also right to say that the system unavoidably places an unreasonably heavy burden on the Member States on the borders of the European Union.
That is also true.
It is therefore a good thing that support for those States is being urged.
On the other hand, I do think a number of important points are missing from the report and I do not agree at all with most of the assumptions and aims of the rapporteur; on the contrary.
One example: the assessment by the Commission already stated that tens of thousands of asylum seekers go into hiding because of the Dublin system, and yet the rapporteur argues against detention.
That cannot be more serious.
The close cooperation between the European Member States on asylum might pay off, but in that case it is necessary to do away with a whole bunch of politically correct ideas that fill this report.
<D>
(FR) Mr President, in reality, if a quorum were to apply to our deliberations, imagine what would happen.
There are only 11 of us present today taking part in debates on extremely important issues, which concern the next Parliament.
This is why I believe that the very principle underlying these changes is highly questionable.
What is even more questionable - irrespective of the work carried out by Mr Corbett - is an amendment which has been rejected by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs being referred back to us by the two main groups in this House in order to modify - in circumstances we know full well concern a specific individual - the traditional provision common to all parliaments of the world according to which the inaugural session is chaired by the oldest Member.
This provision is particularly valid, and wanting to change it simply because the next oldest Member might not be agreeable to the majority groups is clearly an especially underhand measure.
For that matter, this sums up Parliament's problem.
I will have been a Member for 20 years soon.
I have noticed that each time the minority exercises a right, the Rules of Procedure are changed.
It would be better to repeal the Rules of Procedure and then just accept the will of the majority groups.
<D>
Mr President, first of all I welcome the recommendation that the rapporteur has put before us here today of 2% for the 12 months as a voluntary measure.
I think it is a measured position to take.
I am opposed to opening the floodgates on production as this, I believe, would solve nothing.
Let us see how the market develops over the next 12 months.
Then we can come back next year, re-visit the situation and take a much broader view.
Everyone talks about a 'soft landing' for quotas but no one can tell me what that soft landing will be.
It is a word that we use - the President-in-Office has used it and the Commissioner has used it - but what are we really talking about here when we hit 2013?
I know that it is a long way away, but there are many dairy farmers out there at the moment who are really wondering what the situation is going to be as we lead into that time?
So, while the returns for the dairy sector have changed dramatically during 2007, we cannot guarantee that this will continue forever.
Let us be very honest about it.
It was not what the Commission did.
It was not what we, the politicians, did.
It was not what any national government did or even the dairy sector did.
It was market forces in the world that drove market price up and that is exactly what happened.
Cereal prices have been driving the price up.
But we have also got to understand that, coming into the next 12 months, the cost of cereals, the cost of fertiliser, the high cost of energy, the forage cost this summer, is going to mean that lots of the extra money that has gone to the dairy sector will in actual fact be absorbed in these extra costs.
So let us not get carried away in believing that everything is so rosy and everything is wonderful in the dairy sector - because it is not.
The extra 2% will produce a substantial amount.
But I do agree with the Commissioner - let us not make the situation more complicated.
Let us make it easier for the producer.
The milk and dairy farming sector, regardless of where you are in Europe, is the backbone of the small family farm structure, and we must support it.
<D>
(HU) I would like to congratulate the European Commission and the rapporteur, Mr Siekierski on this excellent initiative, a confirmation of the social sensitivity of the European Union and the Commission.
There are two things I would like to ask of the European Commission.
The first has to do with co-financing: I agree with the report, but I would like Mrs Fischer Boel to consider the fact that she is asking for co-financing from poorer Member States, those on tighter budgets, just where the need for food is the greatest.
My second request: transport costs should not be set at 4.5% but, based on the principle of subsidiarity, should be left up to Member States, because lower rates may suffice to cover transport.
Finally, the EU logo should continue to be printed on product labels, since these are provided by the EU.
Lastly, as I do not think I will speak up in debates any more, I would like to thank Mrs Fischer Boel for her entire five years of diligence.
She has made her mark on the history of European agriculture.
<D>
Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, the Commission welcomes Parliament's report on the future European international investment policy.
It is an important step that paves the way for the implementation of the new EU exclusive competence on investment.
As you know, investment is a new frontier for the common commercial policy.
We should seize the opportunity - we are in absolute agreement with Parliament on this - to build together an integrated and coherent investment policy that promotes investments and makes a positive contribution both to economic growth and sustainable development.
The Commission also fully shares Parliament's statement that investor protection should remain the first priority of the European investment policy.
We believe that the new policy should serve the purpose of assuring all European investors that they are able to operate in an open and properly and fairly regulated business environment, not only within the internal market, but also when operating in third countries.
I also take note of Parliament's recommendation that the EU should draw on Member States' best practices found in their bilateral investment treaties.
Indeed, the thrust of the Union's action in this area should be to deliver better results than those obtained by Member States individually.
While aiming at high levels of protection for our investors, we should not compromise other objectives, such as the public capacity to regulate or coherence with other EU policies.
The right of states and of the EU to take the measures necessary to achieve legitimate public policy objectives is a standing rule of the common commercial policy.
It will equally apply to our investment policy.
The dispute settlement regime and the related financial responsibility are also very important issues and we need to further reflect on them.
Our objective, as mentioned in the communication, is to ensure transparency, consistency of rulings and make the system as productive as possible.
We also need to address a number of issues which arise because of the EU's status under international law.
We will take into account Parliament's views, as expressed in the report, when we analyse possible options and further ideas for a comprehensive approach to these issues.
We will carefully consider all recommendations put forward in Parliament's report, while progressively developing and implementing our investment policy.
The Commission has already tabled proposals for investment negotiating directives for Canada, India and Singapore.
We want to seize opportunities for ongoing wider trade negotiations and to engage in comprehensive investment negotiations with those countries.
Parliament's opinion is therefore very timely, to guide the Commission and the Council when we define final respective negotiation directives.
Last but not least, I would like to assure you that, as the development of a comprehensive European investment policy is now a joint responsibility of all the institutions, the Commission will stand ready to cooperate with Parliament and the Council while respecting the division of competences among all the institutions involved.
<D>
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, there is nothing to dislike in this proposal and I commend our rapporteur for coming up with it, especially with an election in the offing.
I think any politician in this room looking to June next year will be in favour of seeing Europe's children eating better and eating European local fruit.
It is good news for Europe's farmers as well because this is creating a local market.
It is good news for the health budget of the future and more importantly it is good news for the children themselves.
If we start children eating healthy at a young age, they will keep up the habit.
Finland has demonstrated and proven that aggressive intervention at an early age does make a difference, and that is very much to be welcomed.
If we speculate a little on the agriculture budget now, we will accumulate on the health budget of the future.
Coming from Scotland I am ashamed to say that we have a particular interest in this, in that 21% - one in five - of our primary school children are overweight.
That is utterly unsustainable.
We cannot look towards a future of increasing obesity, so this is part of the solution to that and I am delighted to commend it to the House.
It is good news all round.
<D>
(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Pribetich, in my opinion your proposal is very comprehensive and balanced.
I therefore want to congratulate you on shedding more light so that we can see the stars better.
The European Union must, without question, be responsible for defining Europe's political aspirations in terms of space, by using it for the European people and economy, and by guaranteeing independent and reliable access to it.
I am also pleased with the Council's conclusions from September which make a useful political commitment to develop the European Space Policy.
The priorities must clearly be the timely application of the Galileo and EGNOS programmes and the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security programme which will assist in the assessment and implementation of European policies impacting on the environment.
As regards financing, we must find instruments appropriate to the European Space Policy which, in addition to that specified in the Seventh Framework Programme, will enable medium- and long-term planning.
The possible inclusion in the budget of a specific chapter will show the European Union's commitment to this policy and increase its clarity and transparency in anticipation of the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty provisions.
<D>
Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for underlining the need for studies and analyses, but also concluding that, if there are distortions on the market, something has to be done in order to achieve a level playing field.
I think it is important to conclude this from this debate.
If there are distortions, we can have different opinions - if they are there.
But if they are there, something needs to be done.
We need to do that because I think we all agree that we want more cross-border competition, and we also wish to secure the interests of the consumers.
It is relevant to discuss the difference between different systems, because if you have in some Member States ex-ante systems and in some Member States different ex-post systems, which in reality assumes that the state might bale out banks which cannot pay their customers, then you have a distortion.
It is my opinion that, due to the differences in opinion we have, there is a distortion already.
The distortion is even more serious if it is also based on the assumption that the state should help banks which are not able to pay their customers.
I think a good achievement with this report by Mr Ehler is that we have achieved that conclusion.
I think it is important that the Commission respond to that in future actions.
We might have differences in opinion about how the state of play is today.
But we do agree on the need for action to be taken if the studies to be done show that there are distortions.
I would like to thank the rapporteur for that and also ask the Commissioner to respond to that with action.
<D>
in writing. - The Government of Malta should follow similar initiatives for the island of Gozo.
All EU Member States which have island regions have applied for similar measures and have been given the opportunity by the EU to take such special measures.
The measures themselves differ from island region to island region.
They have, however, one thing in common: that is, to provide economic comfort to balance the negative aspects of island regions.
The island of Gozo suffers from severe handicaps including double insularity, remoteness, small size and difficult topography.
Countries much larger than Malta, such as Portugal, Italy and Greece, have been able to obtain special measures so as to provide attractive incentives to island regions.
The smaller islands of the Maltese archipelago are particularly vulnerable.
The island of Gozo needs the assistance through the introduction of similar special measures.
It is the duty of the Maltese Government to identify which special measures would be best suited and, subsequently, to apply to the EU to adopt such measures.
It is up to the Government of Malta to reduce the hardships especially prevalent on the island of Gozo.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all I would like to thank you for this interesting debate.
Clearly we are equally strongly aware of the need for a meaningful reform of our control systems.
Let me try to touch on a number of points that have been raised, first of all with regard to the question concerning recreational fisheries.
As I said, this is a very contentious topic, probably the most contentious of all the control provisions contained in the proposal.
However, it has given rise to a number of misconceptions as to what the real objective and purpose of the provisions is.
I said that we are prepared to accept the definition that is proposed in one of the amendments.
I will be setting out clearly our position on the definition and on the proposed regulation of recreational fisheries in the coming days, including by writing directly to the anglers' representatives in order to spell out the objectives, the parameters and the details concerning recreational fisheries.
Then, I hope, I will be receiving feedback from them and, if necessary, we will look into the provisions in order to make them more finely-tuned to the only objective that we need to target.
We have a significant problem with recovery stock.
There are certain recreational activities which impose big pressures on such recovery stock and we need to address this point.
This is only fair for the professional fishermen that we address this.
Otherwise we can never hope to turn the situation around if there is pressure from a significant fishing effort, even though it is carried out in a recreational manner and no earnings are derived from it.
The stock cannot hope to recover if there is significant effort, as scientific reports have indicated to us.
(Interjection from the floor: 'No science for that at all!')
Concerning the total lack of consultation of the sector, I think that we have consulted the industry.
I myself took part in such a conference in Scotland some time ago.
All RACs have submitted their opinions and, furthermore, as in any other legislation, we organised a public Internet consultation.
The sector was specifically consulted in the framework of the Advisory Committee for Fisheries and Aquaculture in the course of 2008.
Concerning the point made on small-scale vessels, the Commission believes that the small-scale fleet can have a significant impact on resources.
This is the reason why there is no general exemption for this fleet in the proposal.
However, the proposal provides specific exemptions for certain categories of vessels, in general those under 10 metres, and in particular on the VMS, on log book, on prior notification and landing declarations.
In this regard, the proposal respects the principle of proportionality.
Financial aspects are also taken into account at the level of EU cofinancing of up to 95% of the costs for those electronic devices, to help the stakeholders to use the new technologies.
Exemptions will be examined further within the final Presidency compromise.
I would also like to say, with regard to the points made by Mr Guerreiro, that many of the points that he mentioned already exist in the existing control provisions.
Therefore, were we to take up the amendments that he suggests, we would actually be moving backwards with regard to control and enforcement, rather than strengthening the provisions that need to be strengthened.
We are seeking a level playing field in the sanctions provisions as contained in the proposed regulation.
Obviously we are prepared to look into them further in order to see whether there needs to be further fine-tuning, but the main objective of the provisions on sanctions in the proposed regulation is to ensure that there are no significant discrepancies, such as exist today, between sanctions given by certain Member States, or by the judicial authorities of certain Member States, and sanctions that are given by the judicial authorities of other Member States.
Finally, I would like to thank Mr Farage for his confidence shown in my staying here for a second term!

President-in-Office of the Council. -(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Cappato, I am pleased to be back here among you today.
We are following the human rights situation in Vietnam very closely, and the Presidency has just recently had the opportunity to express concern once again following the sentences handed down in particular to two journalists who had written reports on corruption cases.
The Council and the Commission maintain regular dialogue with Vietnam on the subject of human rights, in talks held twice a year.
The last meeting, held in Hanoi on 10 June 2008, allowed us to address, on the one hand, the general human rights situation in Vietnam, and, in particular, freedom of expression, the situation of minorities and the application of the death penalty, as well as a number of individual cases.
In addition to this dialogue, a number of more selective measures are taken with regard to individual cases, where arrests or sentences appear to us to undermine respect for civil liberties and international commitments and, in particular, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which has been ratified by Vietnam.
Moreover, on the occasion of the European Day against the death penalty, on 10 October, we once again explained our very clear position on this subject to the Vietnamese authorities.
They seemed receptive to our message, and brought up the reform of the penal code currently under way, a reform that is expected to reduce the number of crimes subject to the death penalty.
That is the very least they could do.
Ladies and gentlemen, as you can clearly see, the human rights issue is an important element of our relations with Vietnam.
It is a sensitive issue.
Mr Cappato, you mentioned the situation of Christians in Central Vietnam, a matter to which we are particularly attentive, and I thank you for having mentioned it.
I would like to point out that the European Union is the only power to pursue such a global and purposeful policy on this matter, and this at times makes us a target for criticism by our partner.
I wish to be clear about this, however: we will pursue this policy with determination.
I wish to turn now to the future Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, the debate on which is under way.
A new session of talks is currently under way in Hanoi, and will continue until 22 October.
Like any agreement concluded by the European Union with a third country, this agreement must contain a very important clause on human rights.
This clause will constitute an essential element of the future agreement, which may be suspended or even revoked if one of the parties fails to respect it - I want to insist on this point.
At this stage in the negotiations, Vietnam has not challenged the principle of such a clause.
Once again, that is the least it can do.
This is a positive sign by Vietnam and a practical commitment on its part to respect human rights.
The European Union will thus have at its disposal a powerful legal instrument to guarantee respect for human rights as soon as the agreement has been ratified.
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr Cappato, we agree with you that the human rights situation in Vietnam needs to be improved.
We consider that the actions we have been taking for several years now are helping to improve it, but, beyond that, it is in our view the signing of a future Partnership and Cooperation Agreement that will enable us, in this case as in others, to use the human rights clause to provide the best possible framework for addressing this issue with Vietnam.
Naturally, this House will be kept fully informed of the development of the negotiations which, I would remind you, are under way.
<D>
(ES) Mr President, piracy has now become one of the worldwide threats to maritime safety.
According to statistics compiled by the International Maritime Bureau, pirate attacks have tripled over the last decade: whereas there were 90 incidents of piracy in 1995, in 2007 the figure had risen to 263.
As we speak, 26 crew members of the fishing vessel Playa de Bakio have been seized off Somalia and perhaps, as my fellow Member said earlier in this House, we should not only show solidarity with their families, but also request the European Union to take action in this matter and to make every effort to free these fishermen.
It is not enough for us to sign agreements with various African States.
We also have to ensure the safety of these vessels.
The problem is European in scope and must be tackled as such.
<D>
in writing. - (FR) The highly publicised 'Returns Directive', as proposed by the Commission in Brussels and quite wrongly stigmatised by the left and far left as the 'Directive of shame', the violator of human rights, has just been adopted by the European Parliament, to their great displeasure.
However, this Directive, which is supposed to provide for the return of illegal immigrants, is not repressive at all.
It does not criminalise immigrants who have entered Europe illegally.
Better than that, it gives them the choice between legalisation and voluntary return, all this backed up by privileges and guarantees that protect essential human rights.
What about the right of people to protect themselves and not to be submerged by global immigration?
Nothing.
Fortress Europe as decried by all the media in France and elsewhere does not exist.
It is a fantasy created to ease the way for legislation that is favourably inclined towards immigration and immigrants under the guise of a semblance of repression.
This is not a good Directive.
It is all a front.
However it does have the sole merit of representing the first step towards a less immigrationist policy.
It should not obscure the fact that other provisions are being drawn up, such as the European Blue Card system guaranteeing legal immigration for employment purposes, and that the stated aim of these measures is solely to encourage more immigration into Europe.
<D>
rapporteur. - Madam President, it is a privilege this morning to be opening this most important debate and inviting our colleagues to support the reform to the telecom package that we have on the table.
I emphasise that it is a reform.
As you heard, four rapporteurs have been working on elements of it.
On the key reform of the package, I want to pay tribute to my colleagues, Catherine Trautmann and Pilar del Castillo Vera, because we have worked very closely together to bring that package together.
It is an important reform because the existing package that I worked on with colleagues back in 2001 and 2002 has worked very well for the European economy.
We have a thriving and dynamic communications sector with active consumers in the marketplace.
But this reform brings that up to date and my colleagues will explain the areas that they want to work on.
The most important thing is that it makes the package robust for the next decade.
There are substantial improvements that Parliament has made in this second reading.
I would like to place on record, on behalf of the three of us, our thanks to the French Presidency for bringing us a common position in November which has enabled us to bring this improved package to you today in the last session of this mandate, because it is vital for European consumers and the European economy that we give this a ringing endorsement in our vote tomorrow.
As always with these complex issues, I have had tremendous cooperation from my own shadow team - Bernadette Vergnaud, Cristian Buşoi and Heide Rühle.
I also want to thank the team from the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, led by Alexander Alvaro, because an important element of my reforms includes the E-Privacy Directive, which they have handled.
In my four minutes this morning, I do not have time to go through all the points and all the improvements that we have made in great detail.
There will be plenty of briefing about that afterwards.
I just want to give you a sense of what we have achieved and what we are looking for.
In this directive we have significantly improved the rights of consumers and users in the electronic space.
Consumers need to be empowered to make choices between the communication services on offer and, to do that, they are entitled to information.
They are entitled to fair contract terms and conditions that do not tie them for long periods to particular providers.
They are entitled to a high-quality emergency service, to access to social information services over the Internet and voice telephonic communication.
Above all, they are entitled to have their data in the electronic communications space protected.
We will hear more about that later.
We also need to empower regulators to ensure that those entitlements are properly delivered.
All of those are included in this proposal.
I think it is very important to emphasise that this is an enabling and empowering proposal.
It is not a proposal that is any way restrictive of people's rights on the Internet or restrictive of services at all.
We want to give consumers that power to make choices and that is what will open services.
I just want to conclude my first speech by saying this: there have been a huge number of people working on this proposal and we have had tremendous resources behind us.
I want to particularly mention Peter Traung from the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, Luca Vusaggio, our legal adviser, and Lindsay Gilbert from our group, who have all worked closely together with my assistant Sheena Gooroochurn.
We have had great support from the Commission, from Peter Rodford, the Commissioner herself and her team, and also from the Council Secretariat led by Eva Veivo.
I mention that because I think many people outside do not realise the extent and engagement that we have in delivering these complex texts.
I look forward to your support for this tomorrow because it is so important for all our futures.
<D>
in writing. - The problem of obesity and diet-related diseases has taken dramatic proportions worldwide.
In my view, sophisticated and aggressive marketing techniques have prevented consumers from making informed choices in regards to their diet.
In this respect children are particularly vulnerable.
The AVMS Directive foresees that media service providers would adopt voluntarily a code of conduct regarding commercial communication on food and beverages.
While I appreciate the self-regulation aspirations of industry and media, I would have preferred to see concrete restrictions on the volume and type of advertising aimed at children.
The destructive effects of low quality food on society are comparable to that of alcohol and tobacco, whose advertising is heavily regulated.
A similar approach can be applied to foods that have been established as harmful to human health.
Consumers need clear and objective information, which can be provided by requiring higher standards on food labelling and placing more restrictions on advertising.
The current financial crisis has exposed one more time the results from mixing greed and lack of regulation.
Whether you stand to loose your house or your health, I think the stakes are too high for an indifferent marketing approach.
As regulators we need to step in and do our job.
<D>
(SV) I would like to begin by agreeing with the previous speaker that the Doha Round is extremely important, but I would like to add that it has probably never been more important than it is right now.
I believe that, precisely in the midst of this financial crisis, we have a greater need than ever before to show that the global trade system actually works.
To put the Doha Round behind us and say that we cannot achieve global agreements on trade would, I believe, be a disaster that could undermine the whole of the global trade system.
The failure of the Doha Round will probably never be more costly than it is right now.
The fact that the Doha Round is more important now than ever before is precisely due to the financial crisis.
As I see it, the greatest risk that we face with this financial crisis is not the lack of capital for the lending market; the greatest risk is that it triggers protectionist trends.
We have seen this throughout history.
It happened during the 1930s and literally resulted in disaster for the world's economy, and it also happened in the 1970s.
I believe we can already see signs that the world thinks it can solve these fundamental problems by means of greater protectionism, despite the fact that there is a risk of the protectionism spreading and creating an even greater crisis in the world economy.
This is happening in the area of services, financial services and the trade in services, in particular.
In the financial services sector we are seeing protectionism increase very rapidly.
Returning to the Doha Round as it looks today, the main criticism that I had during the entire period that we were negotiating in the Doha Round is probably that it began to be about agriculture, agriculture and more agriculture.
I think that this is an extremely narrow agenda, and I actually think that world trade deserves a very much broader approach, particularly in light of the fact that agriculture is a relatively small part of world trade if we compare it with industrial goods and services combined, for example.
I also believe that it accounts for a relatively small part of the growth potential, particularly, perhaps, here in Europe.
New opportunities for access to markets and new market openings globally, in particular for the trade in services, but also for industrial goods, are, I believe, most important for setting the wheels in motion and reviving global growth.
I would therefore like to ask the Commission a question.
What does the Commission intend to do and what initiatives does it have underway to enable the broadening of the Doha Round in order to get us away from this tiresome situation in which we are all sitting around and reproaching everyone over agricultural trade, agricultural trade and only agricultural trade, when we know that what the world economy needs is a very much broader trading agenda that also includes trade in services and industrial trade.
Thank you very much.
<D>
(EL) Madam President, Commissioner, two proposed measures that stand out are those of grubbing up the vines and adding sugar to wine.
The first is a counterproductive and environmentally unfriendly procedure essentially entailing the forced exodus from their jobs of thousands of small and medium-sized growers who, instead of receiving assistance to stay in their jobs, are being sent away to form a cheap workforce.
As for the addition of sugar, our rejection is based on the fact that a permitted increase to 4.5% vol. and the use of the term 'wine' for drinks which are not made from grapes will downgrade the quality and special characteristics of wine.
Furthermore, the so-called 'simplification of labelling' will contribute further to the downgrading of quality because it will not include the obligation to indicate the area where the wine was produced.
Here I would like to point out that rightly or wrongly, for example in my country in the past, mass grubbing-up operations were carried out, for which, however, no financial assistance measures are now included at European level.
With a clear conscience we shall vote against the proposal, and shall support the minority proposal which addresses the social and economic concerns of the producers in my country, Cyprus, and those of other European producers.
Now should be the time to assist the producers, instead of sending them into a spiral of unemployment and reduced income.
<D>
in writing. - This legislation has the EU written all over it - a classic case of using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.
Its effect on farmers and horticulture businesses in north-east England, the region I represent, will be considerable.
Undoubtedly, businesses will shed jobs and even cease trading altogether.
Undoubtedly, our hard-pressed farmers will be faced with yet more bureaucratic headaches.
Undoubtedly, agricultural yields will go down.
The fact that we are also debating global food security this week is therefore richly ironic.
Pesticides are essential for growing food, and they are already subject to a stringent safety regime.
No-one disputes the importance of protecting the environment but this legislation is unbalanced.
It is overly prescriptive and lacks flexibility.
The Commission has failed to carry out a sufficiently comprehensive and up-to-date impact assessment study.
For these reasons I voted against this proposal.
<D>
Vice-President of the Commission. - You are aware that one of the values on which the European Union is founded is the respect for the rights of persons who belong to minorities, and with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, this is explicitly mentioned in Article 2 of the treaty.
Article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights explicitly prohibits any discrimination on grounds of language or membership of a national minority.
The Commission will ensure, within the scope of its mandate, that these fundamental rights are respected in EU law, including when Member States implement EU law.
There are also a number of pieces of EU legislation and EU programmes that can contribute to improving the situation of persons belonging to minorities; the Commission intends to combine these instruments to address difficulties including acts of discrimination which are likely to affect persons belonging to minorities.
You are also aware that there is the existing EU anti-discrimination legislation, which will be used to ensure equal treatment of persons belonging to a minority, and the Commission has adopted a proposal for a new directive currently under discussion that would extend protection against discrimination on the grounds of religion and beliefs, disability, age and sexual orientation to fields other than employment and occupation.
The Council framework decision on combating certain forms and expressions of racism and xenophobia by means of criminal law also aims to ensure that hate speech on grounds of race, colour, religion, descent or national and ethnic groups and hate crimes are penalised in all Member States.
Now the Commission is monitoring the implementation of this framework decision as closely as possible and a group of national experts has been created to this end.
There is also the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, which plays a key role in assisting the Commission to enforce its task; and there is a Council of Europe Charter for Regional and Minority Languages and the framework convention for the protection of national minorities.
I would like to tell the honourable Member that I hope that more Member States would follow the example of those who have already signed and ratified those important conventions.
<D>
The Europe 2020 strategy aims to set out a plan for the future to achieve economic growth and the promotion of jobs within the European Union.
Its approach must be made on the basis of objectives which refer to a sustainable social market economy, the sustainable knowledge society, and the role of SMEs in promoting employment.
A strong, modern and flexible cohesion policy must be a central element of this strategy.
Embodied in the new Treaty of Lisbon, cohesion policy, through horizontal application, has an essential role in responding to the new challenges of the European Union.
In this context, the objective of European territorial cohesion can be seen to be fundamental.
The priorities for European cohesion must aim not only at promoting competitiveness at European level, through the efficient allocation of funding, but also at helping disadvantaged regions to overcome their social and economic difficulties and to reduce existing disparities.
The active role of the European regions in promoting this strategy must also be highlighted.
The importance of governance at various levels deserves to be highlighted.
It will be desirable to have a deep sharing of objectives, tasks and responsibilities relating to the Europe 2020 strategy between the European Union, the Member States and local and regional authorities.
For the above reasons, I voted in favour of the aforementioned motion for a resolution.
<D>
in writing. - (PL) I endorsed the resolution on a European Strategy for the Danube Region.
Territorial cohesion is listed in the Treaty of Lisbon as one of the European Union's priorities.
Operation of the Strategy for the Danube Region concerns many areas of support, such as social policy, culture and education, environmental protection, infrastructure and lasting economic development.
The very fact of the great impact of the strategy and its solutions in these areas proves that regional strategies should be established and implemented.
The Danube Region needs a strategy, and needs support and our action, because this matter concerns many European countries.
Six of them are EU Member States, and the rest are potential candidates.
The influence of the region is also important for other countries which are not directly associated with it.
The idea of establishing functional regions - macro-regions - began with the Baltic Sea Region Strategy.
The Danube Strategy, as with other macro-regional strategies planned by the EU, has the main objective of strengthening integration by cooperation at regional and local level.
It is extremely important that governments, local governments, non-governmental organisations and citizens work together with the European Union on the development and realisation of solutions which are adopted, because, together with us, they make up the European Union.
<D>
The final draft agenda for the April part-session has been distributed, in which the following changes are proposed (Rule 140 of the Rules of Procedure):
Monday:
No changes.
Tuesday:
The sitting will begin at 09.00 with statements from the Council and the Commission on the disruption of air traffic in Europe.
The debate will continue until 11.00.
From 11.00 to 13.00, the following items will be discussed: a statement from Mr Barroso on the Commission Legislative and Work Programme for 2010 and a statement from the Commission on coordination of humanitarian aid and reconstruction in Haiti.
No votes will be taken on Tuesday.
Wednesday:
No changes.
No votes will be taken on Wednesday.
Thursday:
There will be no sitting on Thursday.
(The order of business was thus established)
<D>
This political will has been noted.
I have been told that, in accordance with our Rules of Procedure, it is only possible to vote on Wednesday.
However, we can let the representatives of the Roma know that this is the case, so as to express our political will.
Then we would be able to vote on both requests on Wednesday.
(Parliament approved the request)
Tuesday:
The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has requested that a Commission statement on MON810 genetically modified maize be included on the agenda and that the debate be wound up with the tabling of a motion for a resolution.
Who wishes to justify this request?
Mr Cohn-Bendit?
<D>
At the start of the year, we were pleased to note that more than EUR 3 billion were earmarked for energy improvements as part of the economic stimulus package introduced at that time.
The European Commission rightly acknowledged that support was required for both the creation of alternative supply routes and the interconnection of energy networks.
However, our delight is mixed with a degree of disappointment.
If we look at the specific support sums, we can see that the support package neglects Central and Eastern Europe, the very region which is most vulnerable in terms of energy supply.
The Franco-Belgian gas interconnection receives more support than the Central and Eastern European interconnections.
While the Franco-Belgian interconnection will be the seventh, joining the existing six, this kind of infrastructure is very often lacking in the new Member States.
In addition to this matter, we were also unhappy that the energy efficiency improvements were completely left out of the support package.
However, this was precisely the area where the package's main aim could have been easiest to achieve, namely, job creation.
Due to the shortcomings mentioned, we believe that two things are of paramount importance.
Firstly, future support plans must focus on those regions where energy investments have the greatest added value.
Secondly, energy efficiency, which is frequently mentioned in EU circles, cannot be forgotten when budget decisions are being made in the future, especially if we know that a more efficient use of energy can already produce absolutely spectacular results in the short term.
<D>
We do not share the vision with regard to trade in raw materials contained in the report.
We do not agree with the criticism that describes policies and measures introduced by third countries as: 'creating obstacles to free and fair access to raw materials (...), which have the effect of limiting access by EU industries (!) to raw materials and commodities'.
Each country has the inalienable sovereign right to decide how it uses its raw materials or how it trades in its commodities.
It is for the people of each country to decide upon the use of their resources and of the wealth created.
The report does not mention that the real problem actually lies with the EU's neoliberal model.
Steeped in neo-colonial ambitions, it seeks to return many countries to the role of producers of raw materials for the countries of the EU, using technology and dominance and control of the market mechanisms - including financial speculation - to promote economic dependence and exploitation by the multinationals.
What is needed is a clear break from the reigning economic and social model, ending dominator/dominated relationships, defending national sovereignty, developing the economic potential of each country and complementarity and solidarity in its external relations, and production geared to satisfying the needs of the people and to preserving the planet.
<D>
in writing. - I sincerely welcome this resolution which demonstrates Parliament's continued concern with the situation in Burma.
We have a responsibility to ensure that events in this country do not 'fall off the radar'.
It is a well known fact that despite plentiful resources and fertile land, Burma remains one of world's poorest countries.
It is also widely accepted that the military junta are responsible for a catalogue of human rights abuses, including the brutal treatment of Buddhist monks who protested against the regime.
In light of recent developments, notably the military junta's intention to force through a wholly undemocratic and illegitimate constitution, it is high time that the European Union exercises all its influence in order to attempt to improve the situation.
The time for simply debating the situation in Burma within the international arena is over.
Negotiations between the UN and the Burmese authorities have proved to be entirely ineffective.
Targeted sanctions on the junta and businesses connected to it are now urgently required.
I fully support this resolution which calls on Council to put into force broader and tougher sanctions on the Burmese military regime.
In this regard, I sincerely hope that our words are followed by actions.
<D>
President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Mr President, in response to Mr Higgins, we continue to pay extremely close attention to the situation in Zimbabwe and to be very concerned by it.
That is why we have condemned the violence from the beginning of last April.
We have condemned the way in which the elections were conducted, but I shall not return to that subject.
As the European Union, we have tried to get the Security Council to pass a very serious resolution on Zimbabwe.
After the agreement providing for a unity government that was signed under the auspices of the SADC on 15 September, the European Union has approached its partners with a view to forming a credible unity government as quickly as possible, in other words to give effect to the will of the people of Zimbabwe, as expressed on 29 March.
The negotiations are continuing, but after President Mugabe's plan to reserve the important portfolios for his party (I remind you that it lost the election, the second round of which was fraudulent), these efforts at mediation have failed.
The Council has indicated that it will continue to monitor the situation very closely.
It has, moreover, encouraged the mediation efforts of the SADC, under the leadership of President Mbeki, to arrive at a more satisfactory result with regard to the choice made by the people of Zimbabwe on 29 March.
If these efforts continue to be blocked, we are ready to take additional measures by way of sanctions directed at the Zimbabwean authorities.
Given the very grave humanitarian situation, we do not wish the population to become a victim of this situation, and that is why the Commission has just released an additional amount of EUR 10 million to deal with the situation in which the people of Zimbabwe find themselves.
In conclusion, as regards the economic and social aspect, I should remind Parliament that the Union is ready, once a credible unity government is in place, to adopt measures supportive of the consolidation of democracy and of economic recovery in that country.
I should therefore remind you that we remain vigilant and remind you of the fact that the European Union remains active on all fronts - political, diplomatic, economic and humanitarian - to ensure that justice be given to the people of Zimbabwe.
<D>
in writing. - (PL) I welcome the discussion on drugs.
They constitute a serious problem but bureaucratic efforts have not curtailed the activities of dealers who sell drugs at schools, centres of higher education, housing estates and other public places, and it is unlikely that they will do so in the future.
In 1998 a special session of the General Assembly of the United Nations set itself the goal of creating a drug-free world in the course of 10 years.
Subsequent years saw the publication of many recommendations, regulations, decisions, reports and a Green Paper.
We have today voted on yet another draft resolution.
We would do well to reflect on what all this has achieved.
I am sorry to have to say that never in the history of mankind have drugs been as easily obtainable as they now are.
All that remains is for it to be possible to order them through the Internet.
I voted in favour of the resolution because I support any measure to combat drugs.
Nonetheless, I should like to point out that until we isolate producers from distributors and introduce radical changes to the penal code to create an effective deterrent for people who make a living out of drugs, this problem will not be reduced.
On the contrary, it will increase in magnitude.
<D>
(FR) Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, let me say what a pity it is that the minister responsible for the Ecofin Council is not here.
She is the President of this Council and is calling for strong European cooperation.
I think her rightful place today was among us.
President of the Commission, I hear you and I am not going to copy those who say it is all just words, but all the same, when have I really seen you mobilised on these issues since the crisis began?
You have come here on occasion with proposals, when you felt that within the Member States, particularly the largest (I am thinking of France and Germany on the issue of sovereign wealth funds), there might be trouble.
You came with a proposal drawn up within your own cabinet, independently of the Commissioner in charge, Mr Charlie McCreevy.
However, since then, I have not really had the impression that you are particularly mobilised.
Anyway, I wanted to ask you something: where today have you hidden the Commissioner responsible for the state of the financial markets?
I am wondering why he is not at your side.
I am pleased to see our friend Joaquin Almunia beside you, but I find it a little strange that the Commissioner responsible is not here.
As for the Commissioner responsible, in July 2007, when all his services were mobilised, what did he do about informing us that the situation for the European banks was going to be dramatic, that the aftermath of this crisis for the European economy was going to be dramatic?
Your services were told.
That was the moment, Mr Barroso, to come with proposals that would have made it possible to reassure European savers on the deposit guarantee, on how we were going to manage these difficult situations.
Where was your Commissioner then?
You are delighted that the Commission - listen to me, Mr Barroso - was invited to sit on the Financial Stability Forum.
Did you know that when the Forum met last Monday, your Commissioner, Mr McCreevy, did not go because he was in Dublin?
What did he say when the country he comes from decided to go it alone on the question of deposit guarantees in the sector for which he is responsible in the Commission?
You tell us there is resistance within the European Council, but do you really need to await orders from the finance ministers to set up a deposit guarantee scheme or to look at how accounting standards will be applied at European level?
Mr Barroso, it is your political responsibility today to demonstrate courage, leadership and initiative.
Up to now, I have seen no such thing.
<D>
We, the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece (KKE), are voting against the joint resolution for the following reasons:
• it calls for the imperialist cooperation between the United States and the EU to be strengthened by boosting NATO in order to manipulate and exploit peoples and states;
• it confirms the strategic anti-popular EU-US alliance against 'terrorism'.
However many hypocritical appeals are made to respect human rights, the alliance is nothing more than a pretext for jointly waging a relentless war against the people;
• the resolution uses the excuse of the effects of climate change on countries and peoples to prepare the way for new imperialist interventions in league with the United States;
• through its policy of treating all sides equally, the resolution in fact supports the occupying Israeli forces and their crimes at the expense of the Palestinian people.
It accepts the continued occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan and suggests practical cooperation measures between the United States and the EU in the Euro-NATO protectorate of Kosovo.
The resolution is yet more proof of the irreversible strategic agreement between the EU and the United States at the expense of the people.
The resolution flaunts political might to show that the EU is supposedly a rival of the United States, which it feels inferior to.
<D>
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are very pleased to welcome Prime Minister Rodríguez Zapatero here to the European Parliament.
We are pleased, too, that you came here after the Lisbon Summit, and that you came here just 72 hours after your nomination as candidate.
We would have been even more pleased if the PPE-DE Group had at least been represented by their Group chairman today.
I can tell you one thing: Mr Daul has missed a good speech from the Spanish Prime Minister this afternoon.
He has also missed a less convincing speech from Mr Mayor Oreja, so it was probably a good thing for him that he was not here.
Since the empty seats on the right of this House also tell their own story, let me say that when Swedish Prime Minister Reinfeldt visits us, who belongs to their political family, the Socialist Group will be in attendance in the same kind of numbers as today, because I believe courtesy is a quality that you either have or you do not, and those on the right do not have it!
(Applause)
Spain and the Spaniards, represented by the Prime Minister of their country, have the right to be respected, and that means respect from all the political families in this House.
We accord the Spanish people that respect.
Mr Zapatero, you have thanked this House and you have thanked the European Union.
That was a very memorable sentence from the head of the government of Spain, a country which for 40 years suffered under a ruthless and brutal dictatorship, and which gained its freedom and democratic diversity through its integration into Europe.
For you, the Spanish Prime Minister, to stand up and thank the European Union does you great credit.
However, we owe you a debt of thanks too, for the fact that Spain has succeeded in these endeavours.
We owe our thanks to the Spanish people and Spanish democrats, men and women.
Their contribution to Europe is a contribution to democracy, diversity, cultural progress and social stability.
We must therefore voice our own thanks to the Spanish Government.
(Applause)
Spain is a model for Europe, as is the Iberian region as a whole.
The same applies, incidentally, to Greece and all those countries which had to overcome Fascist dictatorships and set a course towards the European Union in the early and mid 1980s.
As Western Europeans, we had the freedom to travel to these countries at that time and so we can compare them then and now.
Spain is a country with a flourishing economy.
It is a country with a great future, full of hope, a country whose people have made an immense contribution to peace in the world, a country which is economically prosperous and which is rightly knocking at the door of the G8 countries because of its economic strength.
Who would have thought that was possible 20 years ago?
So why do I say that Spain is a model?
As you yourself said, Prime Minister, if the European Union's structural and regional policies have the same economic effects in the countries which joined the European Union on 1 May 2004 as occurred in Spain, Europe as a whole can look forward to a very positive future, and that is why Spain is a model for Europe.
(Applause)
Prime Minister, Spain - you put this very well - has won out as a result of its integration into Europe.
Like many other countries in the European Union, Spain relinquished some of its sovereignty when it introduced the euro.
Relinquishing sovereignty over the currency means relinquishing part of national sovereignty.
However, let us imagine for a moment what might have happened if Spain still had the peseta, and imagine if the Zapatero government, as its first act in office, had said, 'we are withdrawing our troops from Iraq'.
The US dollar could have played games with the peseta, and what economic effects might that have had?
Relinquishing this currency element of sovereignty actually conferred a degree of independence and sovereignty for Spain.
That is another reason why Spain is a good model, showing how European integration brings more, not less, strength.
(Applause)
Mr Zapatero has talked about many different issues.
On behalf of my Group and on behalf of the men and particularly the women in my Group, may I say a few words about gender equality.
Very few heads of government in Europe have done more to promote the rights of women than you, Mr Zapatero, and the European Parliament owes you a debt of thanks for your endeavours in that area too.
(Applause)
(ES) Mr Zapatero, please continue with your excellent, modern and progressive policies.
They are good for Spain and what is good for Spain is also good for Europe.
Keep going, Prime Minister.
(Standing ovation from his Group)
<D>
The economic crisis we are seeing is made up of a continuum of three crises that are linked to one another.
These are the financial crisis, the crisis in the real economy that followed it, and the crisis in the public economies that now comes from them.
These crises reveal the problems of European and global control and supervision: the economic crisis is largely a matter of a crisis in the system that once prevailed and in policy.
Both the world of finance and economic activity no longer know their limits.
It is not possible to manage activity that goes beyond its limits merely by resorting to national tools: we need regional and global rules.
As Mr Monti's report, which appeared last week, states, a single ad hoc solution to each crisis is no longer enough for Europe.
We need predictive and longterm solutions and tools to help us manage future crises better than we do now.
Crucial here are the willingness and ability of the Member States to cooperate, and that still leaves a lot to be desired.
The Council deserves praise for its decisive action in its solution to the crisis that has threatened the whole of the Union, but not for its very prompt action: real action on the part of the Member States only followed because it had to.
The dawdling probably caused the situation to escalate.
One of the most obvious forms of action in the future is the need to reform the EU's budget and ensure that national budgets are more closely in line with common objectives.
Financial controls and regulation are already being made more effective, but we still need more measures to ensure that all financial products are brought within the scope of effective and viable regulation.
<D>
Vice-President of the Commission. - The dangers of the Internet and the development of the Internet constitute a huge issue.
We all know how new the Internet is in our world and how it has developed exponentially over the last few years.
As such, both the positive and dangerous sides are very new to society and governmental structures.
Of course, governmental structures, including European institutions, must adequately assess all the possible threats, and I am sure that they are doing so.
The Safer Internet Programme is one response to threats already identified.
Another threat already identified is cyber attacks and different attempts to attack and block via the Internet.
Criminals are also using the Internet, and law-enforcement agencies are actively working on how to deal with these possible threats.
So I think that one of the main priorities for governments - and also European institutions - is to respond adequately; and in this sense, 'adequately' means that we should not restrict the enormous advantages which the Internet offers to all users.
However, while all the different aspects of development threats and possibilities - and adequate reactions thereto - are definitely more a question for the specialists in this area, they are also in the interest of all Internet users.
I can assure you that the Commission and its relevant services are monitoring the situation intensely.
Concerning participation in this programme, the Commission's attitude is that applications can come from a large variety of possible applicants, including small and medium-sized enterprises, and that those enterprises are mostly the providers of these kinds of services.
Therefore, I think it would also be good for those enterprises.
If I understood correctly about the possibility for the younger generations to participate in this programme, I cannot give you a concrete answer at this moment, but the Commission is very open to involving as many participants as possible to work with this programme.
However, I cannot give a concrete answer today on the issue of young people's participation.
Subject: Special adviser Richard Boomer and the Heysel site
Since 1 April 2006 the Belgian real estate entrepreneur, Richard Boomer, has been working as a special adviser to Commissioner Kallas on issues relating to buildings.
His contract has now been extended.
What led the Commissioner to extend this contract?
Which decisions by the Commissioner has Mr Boomer influenced?
Which internal meetings in the Commission has Mr Boomer attended since the extension?
It now seems that another Belgian real estate promoter is seeking to bring pressure to bear to have some Commission offices located on the Heysel site in Brussels.
Will the Commission give its opinion on this site?
What is the timetable for decision making?
When will the results of the architects' competition for the Rue de la Loi be announced?
<D>
(DE) Mr President, like many who have already spoken today, I am pleased about the Irish 'yes' vote and I would like to congratulate all those who fought for this, particularly the Irish Greens in the Comhaontas Glas.
However, if it is true that it is a day of celebration, then it is, in any case, a hard-won day of celebration.
It would be wrong of us now to simply return, full of self satisfaction, to the usual routine institutional processes as if nothing much had really happened.
The President of Parliament referred, in his first statement on the subject, to the fact that we should also listen clearly to the 'no' votes.
To this I would add that we should also listen to the voices that are barely audible, the ones who, during the European elections in June, thought it unnecessary to take part in the election and play their part in supporting this process.
What I mean by that is that we must take account of the fact that a committed way forward can only be successful if we make a more serious effort than we have done so far to involve the citizens.
We have certainly lost time.
We have lost years.
Europe has fallen behind in international terms.
We only need to look at the G20 meetings to see that.
However, Europe will only become more dynamic if it has a stronger involvement on the part of its citizens.
I do not think that the people of the Czech Republic should be pressurised, due to the disruptive stance of their President, by means of an announcement that, if there is any doubt, they will not get a commissioner.
However, there is something that is even more important and that is that it would be a serious mistake to decide on Tony Blair, or any other possible candidate for the office of President of the Council, behind closed doors.
Instead, this needs to be discussed openly with the people of Europe.
I propose that we have a hearing in Parliament for all the candidates for this office.
(The President cut off the speaker)
<D>
(RO) Mr President, the report we have before us today is objective and fair, highlighting that Romania and Bulgaria are fully prepared technically to join the Schengen area.
On top of this, in certain aspects, Romania can be used as a model of good practice, as indicated in the assessment documents.
It is my firm belief that the accession of Romania and Bulgaria to this area will not have an adverse impact on the borders' security.
Quite the opposite.
It will boost Europeans' confidence in the Schengen area.
There is often talk about mutual trust, just as has been mentioned in this debate, too.
However, how can we talk about mutual trust when some Member States are changing the rules of the game midway by introducing new criteria for joining Schengen?
The arguments being used today against Romania and Bulgaria joining the Schengen area were not taken into account for any other state which has joined Schengen in the past.
The only thing that Romanians and Bulgarians expect is fair treatment in relation to the other countries and an objective assessment based on the same criteria.
Parliament must send the Council a clear message in this respect and insist on a definite date for accession.
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, I am happy to support the proposals presented today.
I believe there is an urgent need to create a common set of standards for the verification of biometric data.
Colleagues may not be aware that at present there are wide discrepancies between countries as to how rigorously, for example, they verify passport photographs.
Many countries require that the citizen applying for a passport actually present him or herself in person, together with their documents and photographs, and in these cases the officials at the passport-issuing office can see if that person bears a resemblance to the photo presented.
However, in some countries - maybe most notably in the United Kingdom - applications by post are the norm, and the authenticity of the photo is only confirmed by a so-called 'professional person' who has known the applicant for at least two years.
The list of persons eligible to do this in the United Kingdom makes for fairly interesting reading.
This verification can be made by your optician or your dentist, but also by a professional photographer or a fire service official - no disrespect to members of these professions.
It is also interesting that fairly lax rules on verification exist in the United States.
Verifications of photos for passports for first-time applicants can be carried out at so-called 'acceptable facilities'.
In fact, this means the staff at the local post office.
It seems incredible for such a security-conscious country, whose citizens enjoy visa-free travel to Europe, to have such a system of verification.
So, in order to make passports secure, we really need to bring in much more reliable biometric data, namely fingerprints.
We also need to ensure that the agency responsible for their collection and verification complies with the same standards, not only within the EU but also in those nations whose citizens do enjoy visa-free travel to Europe, to assure us that they too are meeting the same stringent requirements as are our citizens here in Europe.
<D>
Madam President, the problem of human rights in China keeps coming up in these urgent debates, always with good reason.
China's economic growth and increased international standing have still not resulted in any real difference in the approach to civil liberties, abuse of power by the authorities, room for opposition and independence of the judiciary.
Harsh penalties are still being imposed, including frequent use of the death penalty.
China is not the only country that sentences people to death and executes them, but it is the champion in this.
The only progress that we have seen is that more care is now taken to be certain of the perpetrator's guilt before the death penalty is carried out, so fewer people are being put to death who later turn out to be innocent.
Meanwhile, the international focus on the three great dramas in China has to a large extent disappeared.
The bloodbath in Tiananmen Square in 1989, the persecution of the supporters of the Falun Gong movement and the changing of the composition of the populations of Tibet and East Turkestan are being given less and less attention.
All the attention is now going to economic growth, export opportunities to China, opportunities for cheap imports from China, the growing role of China in Africa and the coming Olympic Games in China.
Under these circumstances the pressure to improve the human rights situation in China is dwindling.
The Olympic Games have become an argument for pulling down residential areas and driving the residents away.
Chinese ambassadors say that their national honour is violated when this is criticised from abroad.
The coming Olympic Games could have been an occasion for improvement.
As things look at the moment, they will be good for tourism and good for the completion of major public works, but not good for improving human rights.
In the Netherlands, meanwhile, a debate has started about the possibility of boycotting these Olympic Games.
A resolution about a single arrested human rights activist, Hu Jia, is necessary but it is not enough.
The most important factor in the relations between Europe and China should not be economic self-interest but our concern about human rights in China.
<D>
author. - Mr President, I initiated this urgency resolution in order to exert political and public pressure on getting the EU peacekeeping mission to the eastern Chad border region deployed as soon as possible.
The recent unrest in eastern Chad, including heavy clashes between rebel fighters and the Chadian army, underscores the urgent need for our presence in this region to protect innocent refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) from getting caught in the crossfire.
These military offences are exacerbating criminality and leading to increased insecurity around the IDP camps.
Not only is access to the camps being impeded for humanitarian personnel, but they are wrestling with the problem of banditry, restricting their ability to provide much needed humanitarian assistance.
I call on the EU and its Member States to honour the political decision made and to provide this mission with more troops and appropriate financial, logistic and air support, including the necessary number of helicopters, as soon as possible.
The EU's credibility in its foreign policy on the world stage is at stake if it cannot mobilise sufficient troops and equipment to make this mission operational.
This is an EU peacekeeping mission and therefore concerns all EU Member States, whether they are participant countries or not.
I would like here and now to dispel the myth that this mission will be French dominated.
This mission has troops coming from Sweden, the Netherlands, Poland, Austria and Ireland.
Furthermore, it will not be French led but Irish led.
Irish Lieutenant General Pat Nash has been appointed to front this mission, and he will therefore be calling the shots - excuse the pun - concerning troop activities on the ground.
This operation is going to go ahead, and such remarks are simply not helpful when it comes to aiding this mission's perception and eventual reception among the local population in Chad and among the rebel groups.
There have been some hopeful signs of movement this week from other EU Member States, following Ireland's appeal for this mission to be adequately resourced.
It appears that one country has offered medical supplies, while other Member States are discussing providing funding to assist other countries to supply necessary logistical support, including aircraft.
Another fourth-generation conference must be called immediately to come up with the necessities to protect our troops in the field so that they can go about their important job of protecting refugees.
The time to act is now.
Our inaction will cost lives.
<D>
Mrs Figueiredo, you know our position on budgetary consolidation.
It is particularly indispensable for a country like Portugal that is facing certain sovereign-debt problems, but it also needs to be undertaken for the European Union in general.
However, in the recommendations that we made in a document that we have just published, we called on the Member States not, where possible, to reduce investment in education or research, and specifically not in the energy sector.
Moreover, there are Member States that are doing this with great success: Member States that are undertaking budgetary consolidation exercises but are even increasing funding for research and education.
In relation to countries with greater financial difficulties, the way we play it must involve solidarity and cohesion.
That is why I will not tire of advocating economic, social and territorial cohesion at European level.
Solidarity is important.
Solidarity cannot be an empty word.
We must, if you will pardon the phrase, make solidarity operational.
<D>
(ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the reform of the Growth and Stability Pact and the relaunch of the Lisbon Strategy, identifying growth and sustainable employment as European priorities, have been bearing fruit since the spring Council of 2005.
Europe has been implementing a common agenda and, as Mr Almunia has said, its first three-year cycle has seen an increase in growth, the generation of employment, improvements in public finances and an increase in the European economy's potential for growth.
Although results vary across the different Member States, the general tone is positive.
I was genuinely surprised to hear one fellow MEP saying that it was impossible to square the circle, that it was impossible to grow, create employment, increase social protection and save.
There are examples of these things happening in the European Union and the one with which I am most familiar is of course that of Spain.
The European Commission has stated that Spain has made good progress in implementing its national reform programme, has reached a level of employment 66% higher than the European average three years ahead of schedule, increased investment in research and development (R&D) and has recorded surpluses in all budget years.
It is a prime example of the success of the Lisbon Strategy, which has strengthened Spain's economy and been the motor of unprecedented convergence to the extent that it stands at 105%, ahead of the Community average.
On that ground we must today maintain the same strategic challenges based on accelerating globalisation and the ageing population.
In order to achieve this it will be necessary to highlight the social dimension.
A Europe which is a knowledge society needs to build a freedom of knowledge, to make a reality of digital inclusion and foster the social dimension by improving people's basic skills, providing SMEs with opportunities and establishing a model for flexicurity with social standards.
It will be necessary to address issues which have surfaced recently, such as the subprime crisis and fuel and food prices, but when we do so we must bear in mind that the our circumstances are sounder, that next year we will celebrate the tenth anniversary of the euro and that we must strengthen international economic cooperation.
<D>
author. - (FR) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, thank you very much, Commissioner, for being here.
However, we were expecting Commissioner McCreevy - as I am sure you know or suspect.
You can tell him that Parliament does not really understand why he is not here today at this debate.
I have heard that he thought it was bad form to debate these issues with the European Parliament before discussing them in the European Council, or before the European Council had discussed them.
Yet this subject was on the Ecofin Council agenda and, all over Brussels, and perhaps in other European capitals, the draft conclusions are circulating.
Here in plenary, we will be having a debate tomorrow to prepare for this European Council, so why, when it comes to financial markets, can we not prepare these questions with the European Parliament too?
This is something we do not understand, unless the Commissioner is currently campaigning in Ireland for the Treaty of Lisbon, but if he is, he could at least tell us.
If he is preparing his future, we are interested in that too.
In any case, if Commissioner McCreevy wants to advocate transparency in financial markets, I think he ought to start by being transparent about his own diary!
Financial innovation is an important issue.
I also think that, in this Parliament, it is time we acted on the need for regulation.
We are often told: if you regulate the financial markets, capital will leave the European market.
Today, as my American colleague says, I think the only thing we are seeing is not the disappearance of capital, but the disappearance of the consequences of subprimes.
When we approach this debate, we want to do so with three things in mind: obviously functioning financial markets, but also a genuine capacity to finance the economy and an ability to anticipate the needs of financial markets for stability and protection against the systemic risks.
It is in this spirit that we are tackling preparations today for the European Council, with the idea that European monetary policy probably reacted well at the start of the crisis, but that today, in a way, the European supervisor has been found out - and that is what bothers us.
When we look at the issues that will be discussed in the next European Council, we wonder: how capable are we really, at European level, of anticipating a crisis?
People talk about an early warning system, but what we see is that, in the markets, the people who really have the ability to raise the alarm are called Goldman Sachs.
Are we therefore going to learn any lessons from this for the way Europe operates?
I hear a lot of talk everywhere about transparency.
We are all in favour of transparency, but what of that call for transparency when, for the last eight months, all the large investment banks have been called upon to give their figures, to give their assessment of their exposure to risk?
They cannot do it, because behind it lies a challenge in terms of reputation, and undoubtedly in terms of valuation, a challenge that is extremely difficult to deal with.
Therefore, when I hear people talking about an alternative, the early warning system - I have already said something about this ...
As one IMF councillor said to me the other day, the early warning system is a bit like when it says: 'Smoking kills' on a packet of cigarettes.
How much does it change your behaviour?
Not a great deal.
Of course, the IMF and the Financial Stability Forum have a role to play in this.
Who does not know this?
However, it should be an alternative to our ability to watch how our systems are working.
I should say, on this point, that the surprises for this Parliament are just getting bigger.
When we adopted the Ehler report on deposit-guarantee schemes on 13 December, we were told that it was much too complex a business and, anyway, it would not provide any guarantees for how the systems would function.
It seems today from the main conclusions of the Ecofin Council to be a way of escaping the crisis, or in any case, a matter that should be reopened as a matter of urgency.
If you do reopen it, Commissioner, or rather if your colleague Commissioner McCreevy reopens it, we will be next in line to examine it.
At some point, you perhaps need to listen more carefully to what Parliament says about issues like this one.
Similarly, as regards the credit-rating agencies, we can only refer you - or refer Commissioner McCreevy - back to what we said before.
We know that the Commission wants to present proposals for the amendment of the Capital Requirements Directive, or CRD.
We will be examining these proposals carefully, but we do not think that this will be enough to give the European Union the system of supervision it needs, unless we take account of all the proposals that have been on the table for some months now.
This also concerns the situation of the supervisory committees - the three 'Level 3' committees, as we usually call them.
For these three Level 3 committees, we need a proposal for legislation that gives them a solid legal basis to act and to strengthen their capability, including in dialogue with the other supervisory authorities, because the idea that we are going to bring in the other supervisory authorities without having our own solid system of supervision does not seem very satisfactory to us.
We would like the Council and the Commission together to look at the proposals on the table, not forgetting, of course, the proposals that the Italian Finance Minister, Mr Padoa-Schioppa, made at the Ecofin Council in December.
In the same spirit, here too, we would also like to think more proactively about improving our regulation system, out of respect for the principle of subsidiarity.
We do not believe the idea of a lead supervisor would satisfy all the Member States.
What Parliament should be asking for is a solution that includes all the Member States and that enables each one to feel comfortable with the supervision system.
On all these matters, I would be grateful if you, President-in-Office, and you, Commissioner, would make your comments, bearing in mind that I am obviously merely expressing questions that are being asked in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, since we have not yet deliberated on a proper report.
<D>
in writing. - (PT) The general aim of the proposal presented by the European Commission is to continue the EU-wide liberalisation of scheduled and occasional coach and bus services - in particular between the various countries within the EU and between these and third countries, including cabotage operations - as from 1 January 2009.
The following are some of the many aspects that we reject:
those aiming to limit the competence of a state to manage passenger road transport on its territory, particularly in defence of this public service (not to be confused with the so-called 'public interest service' which is privately owned, but financed with public funds);
removing the concept of 'working time' and solely referring to 'driving time' and 'rest periods', which aims to increase the exploitation of drivers;
the (re)introduction of the 'twelve-day derogation', in other words the possibility of deferring the weekly rest period for 12 consecutive periods of 24 hours which, in our opinion, could lead to situations endangering the safety of road transport professionals and passengers.
Look at the situations that already occur under more restrictive rules with regard to working time and rest periods.
Hence the reason for our vote against the proposal!
<D>
Madam President, Roxana Saberi is a 32-year-old journalist with dual American and Iranian citizenship, and is a graduate of several universities in the United States, the United Kingdom and Iran.
She was working as a journalist in Iran and continued to do so following the expiry of her accreditation, and was arrested and sentenced to eight years in prison on a false charge of spying for the United States.
In protest at the false charges and the lack of a fair trial she went on hunger strike.
She is very emaciated.
She began to drink sweetened water under medical care and has now ended her hunger strike, and is waiting for her appeal to be heard.
Her health and her life are still in danger.
Iran is well known for its draconian punishments, and also for carrying out public executions, including on juveniles.
We call for the release of Mrs Saberi.
We appeal for her to be given a fair trial.
I think that the international community should put pressure on Iran to end these draconian practices.
<D>
in writing. - (CS) The Member States agreed to set up common airspace blocks to control a single sky, irrespective of national borders.
Prior to that two planes collided over Germany and 71 people perished.
The arguments for a single sky are growing stronger: we have 57 control points for 28 000 daily flights; the US has two.
Three years later we are no further on.
The EU has not put all of the Regulations from 2004 into practice.
These Regulations were supposed to integrate airspace in the internal services market and provide a basis for an effective operating system with emphasis on safety, the environment and increased flying capacity.
We currently have 65 radar centres with 31 systems using 22 computer networks, and we expect that the number of flights over Europe will double in 10 years' time.
Do the citizens know that their governments and parliaments are ignoring the benefits of common Europe to their disadvantage?
Why does the process of creating a shared operating airspace for both civilian and military flights over a united Europe take such a long time?
Is it to appease local economic interests?
Is it to protect national sovereignty, to the detriment of transport safety and at high prices?
Today we want to know how and when we are going to integrate the classification of the upper airspace and how are we going to jointly operate the lower airspace in the future.
Can obstacles to the creation of functional blocks over European territory be identified openly?
Is it possible to shed light on the political will of Member States to fulfil their obligations?
We are also worried about the failure of the bottom-up approach because in three years the Member States have not developed the functional blocks needed for more efficient control of the sky.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - (EL) Mr President, honourable members of the European Parliament, the refuse which has been accumulating in the streets of Naples and neighbouring towns since 21 December, as the media inform us, is estimated to have exceeded the huge quantity of 100,000 tonnes.
This, in combination with the negative - I would say catastrophic - effects for residents and the environment, is a cause for grave concern.
The crisis in recent days in Naples did not come from nowhere.
It is the culmination of deficient enforcement of European legislation on refuse over the past 14 years, for which Italy has been repeatedly condemned by the Court of the European Communities.
Beyond the role of organised crime which is emphasised by the press, a direct cause of the present crisis appears to be inaction and lack of will to adopt the measures necessary for solving the chronic problem of waste management.
When the Commission was first informed of the crisis in the refuse collection and disposal system in Campania, in the spring of 2007, proceedings were initiated against Italy for contravention of Community legislation on refuse.
Since then, the Commission has been observing developments at first hand and has already come to an initial on-the-spot assessment of the situation, at the request of the Italian government.
A further meeting with the competent Italian authorities is due to take place in the next few days.
It is the responsibility of the Italian authorities to take immediate measures to clear the refuse from the streets.
But as this new crisis shows, it is not enough merely to remove the refuse from the streets.
Any short-term measures must be supplemented by the adoption and, most important, the effective implementation of long-term strategic measures.
For example, an adequate network of waste processing facilities fully complying with the standards laid down by Community legislation.
This must be accompanied by an integrated long-term strategy of waste management with the aim of promoting recycling and sorting of refuse upon collection.
Legislative Decree no.
61, issued in May 2007 to solve the refuse crisis, did not achieve its aim.
The emergency plan announced by Prime Minister Prodi on 8 January is a more ambitious effort in this direction, but a crucial element remains the timing of the measures, which must be swift and effective.
We shall continue to monitor closely the implementation of the measures in practice by the Italian authorities.
The Commission will continue to exert pressure on the Italian government to end the crisis, and intends to proceed with the legal action against Italy.
The continual violations of Community environmental legislation in Campania must finally be brought to an end, as Community law requires.
Although the situation appears to be difficult, it is not impossible for the Italian authorities to comply with Community legislation on refuse.
I am sure that useful examples can be drawn, not only from other Member States but also from other regions of Italy, where solutions have been found for the controlled disposal of waste by a combination of different types of volume reduction, collection and disposal.
<D>
Mr President, the Commission's first year report on the European Globalisation Fund states that over 13 000 redundant employees in eight Member States are being helped.
3.7% of available funds have been distributed.
Obviously it is very slow.
The Commission's suggestions are to simplify procedures, broadly promote the programme, spread best experience and expand the duration of assistance, and I welcome these measures.
The fund was established to show solidarity with the redundant employees of companies failing due to globalisation.
Therefore it is most important that these funds reach real people who need help.
They shall not be distributed among intermediaries, trainers or brochure publishers.
In one year we will find out what the actual results are.
It is not how much money has been distributed, but how many redundant employees found new jobs.
I call on the Commission and Member States to establish proper criteria and benchmarks in order to evaluate the results achieved.
We must ensure efficient use of the European budget.
<D>
(FR) Madam President, as far as Solvency II is concerned, that is a reform that was launched well before the crisis and that the latter has shed new light on.
As legislators, we have hesitated: did this agreement need to be concluded at first reading?
In the end, the determination of the negotiators will have enabled us to reach a compromise which, I believe, has at least two virtues: firstly, it forces the insurance sector to assess its risks better, a process which, until now, still involved relatively old mechanisms that were without doubt unsuitable for the reality of what the insurance sector had become; and, secondly, it emphasises the need for supervision mechanisms to adapt to what insurance companies have become, in terms of both their multitude of consumer-focused products and offers, and their transnational set-up.
As legislators, we were very keen to take account of the reality of this market, that is to say of a market where, for example, in certain countries there are life insurance mechanisms that account for a substantial share of this sector and where, in the light of the crisis, we had to take account of the effect of pro-cyclicality when applied to the insurance sector.
We also had to ensure that the adoption of this legislation did not disrupt the architecture of the insurance market and, in particular, that it enabled mutual associations to occupy a place within this legislation.
However, it is quite clear that this is just one stage, and I should like to mention six points, in relation to the sector, on which we shall have to resume our work immediately in future.
The first is obviously taking on board the conclusions of the de Larosière report and the need to ensure that equality and harmonious conditions exist among the various colleges of supervisors, and, to this end, the need to strengthen the European authority responsible for monitoring insurance companies.
The second point - many of my fellow Members have mentioned it - is to implement this infamous group support mechanism, and, on this point, I do not share the view of Mr Lipietz.
Of course we would have preferred to have had group support, but what is unclear about the fact that it is difficult today for countries in which 80% or 100% of the insurance sector is in the hands of foreign companies, without any solid legal basis, to accept this mechanism?
We need to make progress in this area.
The third stage for the future is harmonisation between what we are doing here and what is happening with pension funds.
How can we conceive of having to improve solvency in insurance terms, but not of asking ourselves the same question where pension funds are concerned?
This is an absolutely huge challenge.
The fourth task for the future concerns the installation, the creation, the establishment of a deposit guarantee mechanism, as we have today in banking, and which is still lacking in the insurance sector.
The fifth point concerns the marketing of insurance products and the guarantee that the way in which insurance intermediaries offer products to the insured makes it possible to accommodate their interests and protection requirements.
Finally, the last point concerns the transposition, in this sector, of what we are going to put in place for the banking sector, namely retention mechanisms in relation to securitisation.
On that basis, I hope that, in future, we will be able to learn from the lessons of this crisis in order to guarantee European citizens an insurance sector that represents for them a real guarantee of ...

on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (GA) Mr President, I welcome Mr Cashman's report on the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights.
The members of Committee on Civil Liberties have done sterling work on this important subject.
I congratulate them as well as the rapporteur.
But I particularly welcome the improvements whereby discrimination as regards traditional languages and minorities is to be encompassed within the Agency's specific responsibilities.
I call on Members to back these reforms tomorrow.
The United Nations has declared this year, 2008, International Year of Languages.
The European Union has to participate in this venture, and we too must follow suit.
I personally have a special interest in this matter.
I am continuing to work at EU level, to demand the resources necessary for Irish as an EU working language, and at constituency level, to support the campaign for an Irish Language Act, a piece of legislation sorely needed in Northern Ireland to protect the rights of Irish-speakers.
Those rights cannot be exercised at present.
They will be available if they are enshrined in binding legislation and if a body such as the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights is able to challenge my compatriots and others in the matter of discrimination based on language.
<D>
Irrespective of our analysis of what is happening in Belarus, we cannot be complicit in this blatant attack on the independence and national sovereignty of this country, encouraging direct interference in its internal affairs and manipulating events that only the Belarusians and the authorities of the country are entitled to resolve, in order to try and align the state and its authorities with the interests of the European Union.
This resolution is a parade of unacceptable actions, the objective of which is to install in Minsk a regime that is open to the interests of the EU.
Let us look at a couple of examples:
it calls on the Commission to support, with all financial and political means, the efforts of Belarusian civil society, independent media (including TV Belsat, European Radio for Belarus, Radio Racja and others) and non-governmental organisations in Belarus to promote democracy and oppose the regime;
it calls on the Commission to develop a mechanism of registration of NGOs that are denied registration in Belarus for political reasons, in order to enable them to benefit from EU programmes.
Therefore, we did not vote in favour of this resolution.
<D>
in writing. - It is a pleasure to hear statements from the Council and the Commission regarding the Barcelona Process and the proposal for a Union for the Mediterranean.
The latter is to be initiated on 13 July in Paris during the French Presidency.
The Government of Malta has issued a position paper on the said statements.
I fully agree with the proposals being made regarding the Union for the Mediterranean.
As it is important not to duplicate efforts and energies, the suggestion relating to maritime activities is laudable.
Malta has offered to host a secretariat to overview the implementation of such proposals and I fully endorse this offer, not only because of the unique geographical position of the island in the Mediterranean but also because we have the infrastructure, personnel and experience to host such an institute.
To conclude, I would like to mention that, just over thirty years ago, it was a Labour Government that managed to bring world attention to the importance of the Mediterranean and the necessity of collaboration between the countries bordering the Northern and Southern shores of this sea.
<D>
(PL) Mr President, poverty is a multi-faceted phenomenon.
It is generally linked to unemployment, and in particular to long-term unemployment.
That is why work is considered the best way of preventing poverty.
Work is not the only way of preventing poverty, however, as illustrated by the many cases of poverty amongst working people.
We should recall that 78 million individuals are threatened by poverty in the European Union.
This represents 16% of the Union's citizens.
All levels of public authority must join forces with the social partners, civil society organisations and individual citizens.
Social policy and labour market policy need to be better organised and to become more efficient.
Sustained and far-reaching efforts to combat poverty and social exclusion are needed.
We should also remember that legislative social protection programmes should have a preventive role.
They should serve to promote social cohesion and to facilitate social integration.
One of the important points in the report concerns the elimination of child poverty.
Particular attention should be paid to the cases of children being brought up by single parents, in large families or in immigrant families.
Effective solutions are needed to prevent such people from becoming socially marginalised.
<D>
(PL) Mr President, first of all I would like to express my total agreement with the statement by Mrs Foltyn-Kubicka.
The issue of protection of children's rights has benefited from the increasing attention paid to it by European Union legislators.
At the same time, however, an ever-increasing number of areas coming under EU jurisdiction have a direct impact on the rights of the child.
For this reason it is with pleasure that I accept the Commission's announcement concerning the introduction of a strategy on the rights of the child.
The intention to give priority to this issue in the European Union, i.e. acknowledging children as fully fledged subjects of law, is deserving of our full support.
However, the cautious title of the report, i.e. 'towards a strategy', not simply 'a strategy', would suggest that there will be further steps in the form of public consultations, which could help to set out the chief priorities for future EU measures.
To date, the European Union has not yet created any special legal foundation concerning the rights of the child.
At this point I would like to state my disappointment, since, if the constitutional treaty had been ratified, it would have introduced a more appropriate legal framework in Article I-3, which had a direct application to the rights of the child.
Protection of the rights of the child as an internal and external objective of the European Union was included in the Lisbon Treaty.
These rights are also enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
It is shameful, however, that one hundred million children living in the European Union are not equal as regards the rights and freedoms that they possess.
It is obvious that, because of their vulnerability and specific needs, children require special care, as well as appropriate legal protection.
However, the rights of the child should not be separated from, and should not be in opposition to, human rights in general.
An analysis of EU documents would suggest that there could be a movement in favour of treating the rights of the child as an issue that is somehow separate from human rights as a whole.
This is a dangerous path and could create dangerous divisions.
I would like to thank the rapporteur that she did not allow the delicate nature of this issue to cloud her balanced approach to the subject.
It is good that the report does not concentrate exclusively on protective measures, but also emphasises the need for positive affirmation of the rights of the child, such as the right to a family, education, social inclusion, health care and equal opportunities.
<D>
(NL) Mr President, I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur.
It cannot be said often enough, she has done an excellent job.
It was no easy task.
Some fellow Members seem to be particularly quick to take offence.
The starting point of this Directive is crystal clear: equal treatment for absolutely everyone - homosexual or heterosexual, woman or man, old or young, black or white, disabled or otherwise, religious or humanist, and so on.
His right is her right, Mr Weber, our rights are their rights and your rights are our rights.
This, Mr Vanhecke - who has left the debate yet again - has nothing to do with so-called political correctness.
The shadow rapporteurs and the rapporteur herself have put in a great deal of effort to reach this compromise, a compromise that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, too, would be able to support.
No one considers the text flawless, and I can only hope that a substantial majority in the PPE-DE Group will come to their senses by tomorrow's vote.
I am all for freedom of religion but, Mr Weber, you have some cheek setting yourself above others and treating equal opportunities as senseless bureaucracy with your hand on the Bible.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the Commission fully supports Parliament's compromise text which is tabled to be voted at this part-session.
This very balanced compromise text will hopefully facilitate the adoption of the proposal at a single reading.
Such an outcome will be a very welcome development for EU performers.
It will show our appreciation for the creative contribution musicians make to our lives and to our culture.
Parliament's compromise text has four main planks, all of which we wholeheartedly support: firstly, an extension of the term of copyright protection for performers and record producers from 50 to 70 years; secondly, a new claim for session players amounting to 20% of record labels' off-line and online sales revenue; thirdly a 'use it or lose it' provision that allows performers to recover the rights after 50 years, should the producer fail to market the sound recording; and, fourthly, a so-called 'clean slate', which prevents record producers from making deductions from the royalties they pay to feature performers.
I am especially pleased to note that the session players' fund, which operates on the basis of 20% of gross sales revenue, has to date come through the legislative process intact.
Essentially this fund is tested on the fact that, contrary to all the criticism we have heard in the past year, the term extension will, on the one hand, provide income to performers in their twilight years and, on the other hand, promote the emergence of new arts.
Let me stress that this proposal is far from a simple term extension.
For the first time ever in European copyright laws there will be a scheme whereby artists participate in the labels' sales revenue: 20% of gross turnover is set aside for session artists.
This is truly innovative.
Mostly importantly, the 20% set aside is not revenue that accrues to a few superstars.
This 20% is exclusively for distribution to the session players.
Contrary to a widely-held belief, the likes of Sir Cliff Richard will not get a single penny out of the session players' fund, and record labels such as EMI or Universal, which contribute to the session players' fund, will have to make a profit on only 80% of gross turnover.
Then there is the clean slate, a provision that ends the unfortunate practice of deducting advances from featured artists' royalties.
Again, this provision is there for the lesser-known performers because it is their records which often do not recoup the advances.
There is also a clause allowing performers to undo buy-out contracts once their producers cease to sell their recorded performances.
All of this is highly innovative and no EU proposal has ever pushed the boat out so far in favour of performers.
This is not a proposal for the benefit of record labels.
This is a carefully balanced approach aimed at rewarding Europe's creators.
Some might argue that European creators are over-protected.
Those who rely on copyright for their income would beg to differ.
If artists stayed in the music recording business because it pays to do so, consumers would enjoy more variety as a consequence.
We also welcome the invitation for the Commission to conduct a separate impact assessment on audiovisual performers and to come forward with appropriate proposals during the course of 2010.
We are confident that we can deliver the impact assessment within the time foreseen by Parliament.
The Commission agrees that the issue of managing online rights for the redistribution of TV and radio programmes merits close attention.
As a corollary to the term proposal we have addressed the broadcaster's legitimate concerns on online rights.
The Commission therefore proposes to make the following declaration once the proposal is adopted in Council.
The declaration would read: 'The Commission recognises the pressing need for the collective management of the rights of phonogram performers and phonogram producers when radio or television productions incorporating broadcasts from commercial phonograms as an integral part thereof are made available to the public in such a way that members of the public may access the radio or television productions from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.
The Commission will take appropriate measures to facilitate the implementation of such collective management and, as a first step, the Commission will institute a structured dialogue between stakeholders with the aim of establishing a functioning licensing regime.
This declaration is limited to the on-demand making available of radio or television productions and does not cover the making available of the phonogram itself.'
End of the intended declaration.
The Commission put forward this proposal in July 2008.
We are now in the midst of the worst economic crisis the world has seen in my lifetime.
For many EU citizens this crisis affects their daily lives.
Europe's performers often live a very precarious existence at the best of times.
This proposal ensures that performers can in their later life recoup a share in the income they generate.
Parliament is being sensitive to this, and the process has shown that the impetus to act for our creators is still alive.
I believe that all the fears expressed by those who are against term extension will prove unfounded.
In conclusion I would like to warmly thank the rapporteur, Brian Crowley, and express my appreciation and admiration for the efficient handling of this file by the European Parliament.
<D>
Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, Mr Verheugen, honourable Members, your speech, Mr Pribetich, and questioning are particularly pertinent and given the élan with which you have posed and supported them, your speech will be particularly difficult to follow.
They are pertinent, because space has become, as you have pointed out, an essential tool for all European countries.
These missions contribute to our acquisition of knowledge, whether this concerns the observation of the earth or oceanography or meteorology by satellite.
It also corresponds to the growth of our economies through satellite telecommunications and navigation.
It has become, in a discrete yet essential way, an integral instrument for modern life.
Space is also a tool, as you have indicated, that allows Europe to be united around a common ambition and to develop a European identity.
It is in this spirit, therefore, that the French Presidency organised, last July, with Valérie Pécresse, the first informal meeting of European space ministers at Kourou which, as you know, is the European spaceport.
I know that the European Parliament was represented by Mr Rovsing at this event, and I thank him for that.
This meeting allowed us to set out a common vision for Europe in space built around the three principal actors of European space policy: the Union, the European Space Agency, and the Member States - while recognising the Union's increased responsibilities.
Together, these three actors will make Europe one of the main space powers on the international stage, of that we are certain.
To develop a European space policy of benefit to all Europeans, first of all we need to guarantee open and equal access for all Member States of the Union to the advantages that are brought by space activities.
Secondly, we must reinforce existing coordination mechanisms in the space sector, European expertise and investments financed by both the Community and by intergovernmental and national sources.
Finally, it is necessary to improve the synergy between civil and defence space programmes.
Therefore the Union, the European Space Agency and the Member States will ensure that we benefit from an access to space that is autonomous, viable and at the best price, which is necessary with regard to our biggest partners.
Of course, this requires a reinforcing of the role of the European Union in the sphere of European space policy.
It is for the Union to unite demand for space applications, to take stock of users' requirements, to establish priorities and to look after the continuity of services.
Also, at Union level, we have developed instruments and Community financial schemes to take into account the characteristics of the space sector with respect, in particular, to forthcoming financial perspectives.
The 'Space' Council that took place on 26 September made it possible to send into orbit, if I dare say, and to confirm the importance of the two flagship programmes, Galileo EGNOS and GMES.
With regard to Galileo EGNOS, the European Union can congratulate itself on having signed a significant number of cooperation agreements with third countries such as the United States, China, Israel, South Korea, Ukraine and Morocco.
This same Council of 26 September underlined the importance of increasing the coordination between the Commission, the European Space Agency and the Member States in the sphere of research and development, notably for satellite navigation systems.
With regard to the GMES programme, the forthcoming Councils on 1 and 2 December are expected to set out the applicable lines and define the terms of the partnership between the Union and the Member States and to lay down legislative proposals formalising the programme before the end of 2009.
I can already inform you that the Council believes that an approach based on the public good must be maintained for this programme to develop successfully.
Furthermore, a data policy must also be put into place swiftly.
Finally, there must be four priorities that have also been cited by Mr Pribetich: the first concerns space and climate change, inasmuch as the contribution of space applications is unique in this sphere.
The second is the contribution of space activities to the Lisbon strategy.
The third covers space and security with respect to having monitoring and surveillance of European space infrastructures and space debris at European level.
Finally, the fourth priority remains space exploration, this is a political and planetary policy and Europe should act within the framework of a worldwide programme.
In this respect, Europe must develop a common vision and a long-term strategic plan and must also have the necessary political dialogue with other states within an enlarged framework of international cooperation and, in this respect, the Council is very pleased that the Commission has announced that it will be organising a high level political conference in 2009 concerning the long-term worldwide vision for space exploration.
And so, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this renewed vision of European space policy demonstrates a new commitment from the Member States, a commitment that, in the interests of unprecedented European ambition, I have no doubt will resonate across your House.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - We hope that is a fact, but I am not 100% sure, and certainly not sure enough to be open and honest with you.
We should take into account that it is not only the level of the fine, but also reputation, that is hopefully making a difference in the attitude of companies.
I find it interesting that now quite a number of CEOs of organisations who contact me mention that they are aware that this is real politics from the Commission, and that those who are not behaving and are abusing the rules and regulations are being confronted with a huge fine.
As you are aware, with our new fine level, that is indeed not sweet money anymore.
Having said that, they are taking the initiative within their own organisations to confront their own people, and saying that it should absolutely not be done any more in their companies.
They are confronting them, if they are not taking the right measures, and saying that if something is rotten then they should mention it to the top, and that the fact is that later on they would be fired without any form of package.
They also mention that damage to reputation, in combination with the fines, is a very important part of their attitude and their struggle to clean up the companies.
A couple of them recently mentioned that they loved to be on the front page of the Financial Times but not because of our fines.
That is indeed quite a good step forward.
<D>
in writing. - (NL) Around 20% of work in Europe is undeclared.
That undermines our social security system.
It is admitted in this proposal that the market is to some extent corrupt and that that leads to unfair competition.
We support action against undeclared work, but we have to abstain from voting because this proposal has serious shortcomings.
Unfortunately, it is based on a neo-liberal idea that plays off workers against each other.
The fight against undeclared work is used as an excuse to promote the greater flexibility of labour.
That puts Europeans in a worse position on the labour market because they are forced to compete with cheap labour from elsewhere.
The EU enlargements in 2004 and 2007 are having far-reaching effects.
The differences in welfare within the EU have increased considerably because in many of the new Member States what used to be successful industries have now collapsed.
Those countries now mainly import goods and export labour.
People from Poland and Romania go to other countries to work for wages that are not really allowed there, in unacceptable conditions.
Advantage is then taken of their low wages to bring down the wages of others.
Europe cannot integrate further if we have widely differing levels of income within the EU and those differences are exploited in competition.
<D>
in writing. - (PL) Afghanistan is a country faced with many problems.
It is a country that experiences many terrorist attacks, with worsening internal security, and where human rights are not respected.
The country is a producer of an enormous quantity of opium, which also has a negative impact on security and politics, as an economy based on opium production is a source of corruption, weakening public institutions, particularly the legal system.
Over half of the Afghan population lives below the poverty line, with unemployment reaching 40%, and renouncing Islam is still a punishable offence.
Despite the fact that this country embarked on a complicated and painstaking process of reconstruction, it needs to satisfy its inhabitants' needs much better in areas such as education, health, housing, food and public safety.
Help given to Afghanistan should involve short-term and long-term measures made possible by far-reaching improvements to the system of government.
The support of the European Union should be based on the experience and knowledge of the missions of Member States that are present in Afghan territory, using civilian or military forces as intermediaries.
The presence of NATO forces is also vital to combat terrorism.
The large-scale participation of the population in elections should have a positive effect on the country's future, as this shows a desire to create a democratic state.
It is also extremely important to continue the battle against corruption and to encourage the creation of new structures in Afghan institutions.
Restructuring and the joint international effort can have an enormous impact on pulling Afghanistan out of the difficult situation it is in, caused by the long-running internal conflict.
<D>
author. - Mr President, the international community has been absolutely appalled at the information that we have all heard about the law that is being drafted in Afghanistan on the status of Shia women.
It is appalling to believe that, at the beginning of the 21st century, a country that wants to be a democracy and wants to abide by its international commitments can have a law that limits the rights of women.
However, I believe that in our debate, and in everything that we do with Afghanistan, we have to be very careful how we approach things, because Afghanistan is a country that has come through a violent, repressive religious dictatorship; it has endured years and decades of civil war; it is a society in which people, more than buildings, have been hurt and destroyed.
We have to be very consistent in our messages, but we also have to be very careful in how we phrase those messages.
We should call on the Afghan authorities to take a look at the law, to revise it and make sure that it is entirely in line with the international commitments of that country, as well as its constitution.
We should not use this as an election opportunity here for us in Europe but as something that we can pass on to our colleagues and friends in Afghanistan to make sure that they can fulfil the obligations that they have voluntarily undertaken themselves.
In this case we have to assist President Karzai and the Government of Afghanistan in revisiting this law and making sure that it is in line with international commitments and the constitution.
It is part of our dialogue, and we have to be absolutely firm that no measures should be adopted that impede the rights of women.
I agree entirely with what Ana Maria Gomes has just said.
But let us be very careful because, when we deal with a society that has been so traumatised, it is far more important how our messages are heard there than how our messages are understood here.
Let us be very consistent in that and let us call on the Commission and the Council to pass on this message via all of our assistance programmes to the government and authorities in Afghanistan.
<D>
President-in-Office of the Council. - (CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to be able to participate in today's debate.
I would especially like to thank the European Parliament for the interest it has shown in this question and Angelika Beer for her work as rapporteur in drawing up this interesting report.
The Council will definitely study the recommendations contained in the report carefully.
As the report states clearly, it is important to achieve further progress on non-proliferation.
One of the main priorities is to secure a positive and concrete outcome from next year's Non-Proliferation Treaty review conference.
The forthcoming May meeting of the Non-Proliferation Treaty preparatory committee is an important preparatory step for this conference.
The EU will continue to make a positive contribution to the review process in accordance with its non-proliferation strategy for weapons of mass destruction and in accordance with the recent declaration on strengthening international security adopted by the Council in December 2008.
We have an interest in a balanced review aimed at maintaining the overall equilibrium which is the basis of the nuclear non-proliferation regime, and which gives equal importance to all three pillars of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, i.e. non-proliferation, disarmament and exploitation for peaceful purposes.
We believe the review conference can succeed only through a balanced approach.
The EU is aware of the new opportunities for the Non-Proliferation Treaty, especially in connection with the renewal of dialogue between Russia and the US and the renewed commitment to implement the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and to begin international discussions on a credible treaty restricting the production of fissile materials for nuclear weapons.
The EU is also observing with interest the renewed public debate on how to achieve the objectives outlined in the Non-Proliferation Treaty.
One of the reasons for the importance of the review process is the fact that the NPT regime is facing serious problems.
These problems come mainly from North Korea, Iran and Syria.
We must deal with them and resolve them by strengthening the mechanism for monitoring adherence.
As we all know, the EU is active in this area and together with its partners continues to play a leading role, especially in the effort to find a diplomatic solution to the Iran nuclear issue.
As the report states, in addition to the issue of non-proliferation we must also focus on the issue of nuclear disarmament.
We are determined to play a key role in this important area.
The EU is fully intent on promoting nuclear disarmament and thus achieving the objectives of Article 6 of the NPT.
This topic has particular importance for the EU, two of whose Member States possess nuclear weapons.
We call on the international community to join us in promoting the concrete, realistic disarmament initiatives which the EU submitted to the UN General Assembly in 2008.
At the same time we must deal with the nuclear energy issue.
It is important that the development of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes should carry on under conditions of maximum security, safety and non-proliferation.
The EU is prepared to strengthen international cooperation in this area both in the context of the next NPT Review Conference and also in other forums.
Multilateral approaches to nuclear fuel supplies in particular can offer a reliable alternative to the development of individual national programmes in the area of sensitive nuclear technology.
We must make the multilateral mechanisms for nuclear fuel supply more attractive, especially for developing countries, as an increasing number of these countries are considering launching nuclear energy programmes.
The report correctly emphasises the importance of ratifying the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.
The EU places particular importance on progress over ratification and it will pursue progress in order to achieve this objective.
The Presidency has conducted high level visits to the nine countries whose ratification remains essential in order for the treaty to come into force.
We are working for a successful conference to be held under Article 14 of the treaty in New York in September 2009 in order to support the treaty coming into force.
The EU is an important contributor in the development of a treaty monitoring system and is thereby reinforcing the credibility of the treaty's future verification system.
We also believe that it would be very beneficial to try to commence talks over a credible Fissile Material Cut-Off Treaty.
The positive approach recently taken by the US towards the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and the Fissile Material Cut-Off Treaty and in the area of nuclear disarmament is very encouraging.
We genuinely believe that this approach will lead in the near future to certain very concrete measures.
Generally speaking, this new opportunity may play a significant role in moving the NPT review process in the right direction.
<D>
I would like to congratulate Mr Casini on the excellent work he has done.
I will vote in favour of his proposal to create a register of lobbyists so as to increase transparency in the European institutions.
I hope, however, that representatives of the regions, for instance, will be given due recognition.
in the open, pluralist dialogue on which a democratic system is based, and act as an important source of information for Members in the context of the performance of their duties.
In the light of these developments, against this constitutional background, and in keeping with their commitment to transparency, Parliament and the Commission have agreed to establish and maintain a joint register in order to keep a list of the names of, and exercise scrutiny over, the organisations and individuals who take part in the drafting and implementation of EU policies.
One of the important corrective measures necessary is to improve the rules on lobbying firms' reporting of expenditure incurred for lobbying activities.
The current legislation allows lobbyists to report much less than is actually incurred.
Equally important is transparency with regard to the financial resources from which a lobbying and consulting company draws its revenue.
<D>
(FR) Mr President, although I am speaking after my colleague Mr Hökmark, I do not share the position he has just outlined.
I believe that just as we are on the brink of adopting this energy package we must keep in mind three challenges.
The first is the energy challenge or the climate challenge, which highlights the extent to which we must be mindful of the nature of gas as a resource and treat it in a very specific way.
The second challenge is the one our fellow citizens are bringing to our attention: price.
Their spending power is currently affected by the price of oil; they want to have access to a high-quality, reliable constant resource, and for their interests in particular to be protected.
Then, of course, we have the challenge of companies and the challenge of employees.
There are many fears at present: both among consumers as regards their access to energy, and among employees faced with the prospect of the dismantling of gas companies.
That is why, Mr President, I believe that we must pay very close attention to all the solutions that are suggested.
Since it is important to talk about it, I will mention the issue of the third option.
I would first of all like to thank my colleagues in the ITRE Committee, who in their wisdom adopted the Vidal-Quadras/Laperrouze compromise last month.
I firmly believe that this consensual approach allowing each of our Member States to make the necessary improvements to their gas markets, in accordance with their traditions, will be a useful basis for discussion with the Council, and I would like to call on my colleagues to confirm that basis.
Of course, when prices are higher awareness of the delicate nature of climate change is heightened.
However, we must respond to these three challenges, the ecological dimension and the dimension of security of supply, and we must therefore chose the best option, which is the third.
<D>
The crisis of the Arab world has demonstrated that the direction pursued so far in the Neighbourhood Policy has failed.
Financing instruments must be made more transparent, and a result-oriented approach must be applied during the disbursement of aid.
This also holds true with regard to the Eastern Dimension of the policy.
The European Neighbourhood Policy of the future must be founded on cross-border relations between people; this particularly applies to the Eastern Dimension, as the countries involved in the Eastern Partnership also have the prospect of obtaining candidate status.
The matter of the mutual visa exemption between Ukraine and the EU should be treated pragmatically and should not be used to exert political pressure.
The Ukrainian Government has much work to do in the area of reinforcing human rights and democracy.
However, the last people we should be punishing for this are the Ukrainian citizens.
If the European Council supports the Belarusian citizens while imposing sanctions on Belarus, it should not apply a different standard to Ukraine either.
Granting visa exemption as soon as possible - hopefully still in this year - could lay the foundations of the economic trust required for creating a free trade area.
I trust that the Polish Presidency will treat this matter as a priority.
It is unfortunate that the Eastern Partnership summit could not take place during the Hungarian Presidency.
Hungary could have treated the EU's partners in the eastern neighbourhood far more objectively than the Poles, who, due to their historical experience, have been pursuing biased policies in several relations over the past years.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - The Commission is following closely the recent developments in prices in Member States.
It considers that those increases cannot be easily explained by one single factor, but need to be seen in the broader context of rising world demand for oil and gas.
However, increasing investment activity - and in particular the switch to more sustainable energy production - definitely plays a part too.
Moreover, the point of departure for market opening was, in several Member States, very low prices.
In the medium and long term, this failed to give the necessary signals for much-needed investment, and we are now paying the price.
As to the question of whether such price increases can also be attributed to the exercise of market power, the Commission has studied this issue and it came to the conclusion that electricity prices in certain Member States were higher than one would expect in fully competitive markets.
In this respect, the Commission, the Council and the competition authorities armed regulators to identify anti-competitive behaviour and to take the appropriate action.
The Commission is also itself investigating alleged anti-competitive behaviour by certain operators, and has launched five anti-trust proceedings in the course of this year.
The Commission is very much aware of the structural problems in the sector too.
Therefore, the third energy package makes wide-ranging proposals to remedy those structural problems, in particular by proposing ownership unbundling of the transmission system operators.
The Commission has always been of the opinion that consumers should be the main beneficiaries of liberalisation.
The Commission's proposals for the third energy package therefore contain a number of measures which will strengthen the role and rights of consumers.
In particular, the package proposes to give consumers the right to switch supplier at any time and to have free access to their consumption data.
By increasing consumer awareness and rights with respect to their energy consumption, the Commission is providing the tools for a functioning retail market.

(EL) Madam President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, today's proposal forms part of an overall attempt to find a solution to immigration policy in the European Union which, of course, we must all accept smacks of dishonesty.
Dishonesty because we are trying to correct certain aspects of this policy with the blue card, with the decision to remove illegal workers, with the decision today to punish employers of illegal immigrants, but these are only some aspects of the problem that we are trying to correct.
Of course, we cannot understand how an illegal worker takes on work and the person who takes him on in order to cover his residency and survival costs is ultimately punished.
It is a logical contradiction which we need to cover with the terms imposed by decent work.
The legislation of all 27 Member States prohibits illegal and undeclared work, especially with the dual absurdity we have here of illegal entry to the Member State and illegal exploitation.
The problem is therefore a complicated one and the compromise achieved does, of course, have a lot of gaps.
One such gap is with employees who are used mainly by people, shall we say, for charitable reasons and, of course, they provide work but, at the same time, they find a way to live.
What will become of them?
How will they live the rest of their life within the framework of their forced illegality, given that neighbouring countries have not accepted the return of immigrants?
<D>
Many thanks, Mr Cohn-Bendit.
This can also be proposed to the Conference of Presidents.
As a group chair, you may propose this at any time, Mr Cohn-Bendit.
Thank you for your comment.

No amendments have been proposed.

in writing. - For over 40 years, Libya has been ruled by a dictatorial regime in which power is concentrated in one man, Colonel Gaddafi, the longest serving African and Arab leader.
Libyans enjoy free education and healthcare and subsidised housing, benefiting from some degree of social distribution of the oil income.
Yet, despite the GDP growth rates, development lags behind that of other oil-rich countries and Libya is one of the less diversified economies in the region, foreign investment remaining at the mercy of the unpredictable decisions of the ruler.
The Libyan people do not enjoy basic human rights and freedoms, despite the fact that their state has specific international obligations to respect human rights, having been recently elected to the United Nations Human Rights Council and having ratified a number of legally binding international instruments.
Capital punishment is regularly carried out.
In conclusion, Libya's strategic importance and the many challenges it poses underline the need for a comprehensive EU policy towards Libya.
The EU needs to engage with Libya across a broad range of issues.
This framework agreement must also be a substantive tool to promote the rule of law, respect for human rights, protection of migrants and refugees and sustainable development in Libya.
<D>
(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, the mobile telephone and the Internet have become symbols of mobility and innovation.
Citizens should, therefore, have extensive and easy access to telecommunications services.
Despite the many appeals from the commissioner, prices of SMS roaming services are still on average significantly higher and significantly exceed domestic prices for those services.
We must strive to change this situation.
In this regard I value highly the work of the Commission and the commissioner.
The situation with the Internet is similar.
Why does using the Internet from a mobile phone have to be a luxury?
We are all in favour of ensuring the widest possible access to the Internet.
A reduction in the price of data roaming services would certainly help in this regard.
This is important, because this matter in large measure concerns the youngest group in our society.
<D>
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, many of us at last are beginning to realise that our planet is not indestructible and that it indeed has an expiry date which we humans, through our not so wise actions, are bringing drastically closer.
There are of course still some doubting Thomases, not least in our own House, but the number is fast getting smaller, as they overcome the limitations of self-imposed extreme dogmatism, or free themselves from third-party, sometimes suspect, manipulations.
The EU should be, and is, at the forefront of the fight to save our environment, and the series of pieces of legislation aiming at combating climate change which are currently being debated in Parliament are very welcome proof of this.
But to be truly beneficial such legislatures must be substantive and be implemented effectively and in good time.
As always, some compromises have to be made and this has been the case also with the Corbey report on monitoring and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from fuels.
It has to be said that the rapporteur has put up a very enviable and sustained fight to counteract the watering-down effects of the Council positions and to a large extent, I believe she has been successful.
For this achievement, I congratulate her.
It has to be said also that during the hard negotiations the rapporteur kept all shadows regularly and fully informed and thus the resulting cooperation was such that it gave Mrs Corbey a strong hand at the negotiating table.
The compromise package achieved deals, satisfactorily enough under the circumstances, on most controversial issues involved, such as biofuels, metallic additives and the sulphur content of some fuels, and my group fully supports it.
<D>
(PT) Mr President, I would like to begin my speech by expressing my own sadness, as well as the sadness felt by my group, on the death of our fellow Member, Fausto Correia.
On the subject of reform of the Treaties, the Council Presidency only repeated that it very much hoped to reach a further stage, not the final stage, in the process of recovering the project set forth in the European Constitution.
That is, to take one more step in the process begun at the beginning of June under the leadership of the German Presidency to impose the content of a rejected Treaty by presenting it in another form, trying to move forward by default and against the express wish of the people, which is a real political fraud.
This Treaty is an attempt to pave the way for neo-liberal policies which run counter to social rights and advances gained, serving the interests of the large multinationals.
Federalism is being imposed under the domination of the major powers within a framework which grants legal personality to the Union, where the States are deprived of their powers and the European Union is regarded as a pillar of NATO; that is in order to favour meddling and interventionism in accordance with the interests of the major powers.
It is a Treaty which aims to set up an economic, politico-military bloc with imperialist ambitions.
It is a Treaty which will not overcome the deep and irremediable contradictions of this European integration, but which will, on the contrary, tend to accentuate them.
We, for our part, shall continue to condemn the real objectives of this Treaty, to argue that it needs to be rejected and to demand a broad national debate and consultation of the Portuguese people in favour of a Europe of cooperation on progress and peace between sovereign States which have equal rights.
Finally I would like to express my support for the great demonstration promoted by the CGTP-IN to be held in Lisbon on 18 October next.
<D>
Mr President, we propose to bring a new industry, aviation, into the European emissions trading system (ETS), yet that system is spectacularly failing.
It has not reduced carbon emissions at all, yet it has created a whole new stratum of bureaucracy, administration and expense for industry.
It has transferred large sums of money from countries which have been responsible with initial allocations to those which have been profligate, notably from Britain to France and Germany.
Within Britain it has had the perverse effect of transferring funds from hospitals to big oil companies.
The ETS has created a complex web of politically influential vested interests and rent seekers who have lobbied to manipulate the system for their own ends.
The Commission's plans to get tough over allocations will simply move the problem on.
With lax limits on allocations bought in from outside Europe, EU funds will flow to countries like China, where regulation is minimal and records may not be accurate.
So big foreign polluters will make vast profits for little effort, great damage will be done to European economies and CO2 emissions will continue unchecked.
Mr President, it is quite simply scandalous that we propose to bring a new industry into this failing system.
I say to you that you must put your own house in order before you think of extending it.
<D>
Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner is unable to attend this meeting.
On her behalf and on behalf of the Commission, I would like to say a few things about Burma.
In a couple of weeks, on 10 May, the Burmese people will be asked to approve or reject a constitution.
The European Union and its partners believe that in the preparation of the draft constitution there was insufficient involvement of the various political forces and ethnic groups that exist in the country.
The ruling junta has done exactly as it pleases in this process.
As a consequence, the constitution stipulates that 25% of the members of parliament will be appointed from the military while the remaining 75% will be elected.
It is possible that Aung San Suu Kyi may be able to vote in the elections scheduled for 2010, and perhaps even stand as a candidate, but the regime seems to want to prevent her from becoming President of the Union of Myanmar some day.
China, India and ASEAN have some influence: their main concerns are the country's stability as well as trade relations and investment.
With the assistance of discreet Chinese diplomacy, Mr Gambari, the UN Special Envoy, was unable to open up the political process any further and he stated that he was going to concentrate on economic, social and humanitarian issues.
Given the absence of tangible projects, on 29 April the General Affairs Council will discuss all the possible operations the European Union could carry out to influence the situation in Burma.
I would like to stress that the European Union's aim is to promote a balanced approach to the Burmese issue; above all we want objective results.
On 19 November 2007 the Council adopted a version of the common position which introduced new sanctions.
The EC Regulation entered into force on 10 March and its annual review is due to take place at the end of this month.
The European Union's sanctions reflect our dissatisfaction with the slow rate of progress towards democracy, the persistent detention of numerous political prisoners and the violation of fundamental freedoms.
Nevertheless, the impact of the sanctions must be examined regularly to ensure that they are having a direct impact on the members of the regime and their resources.
The Commission has established assistance programmes under the general cooperation policy and these focus on health and education.
I am pleased to note that the European Parliament has expressed its support for these measures under its right of scrutiny.
This is in addition to ECHO's humanitarian aid to assist neighbouring countries and the Burmese refugees in the region.
We continue to support Mr Gambari's mission.
The European Union is part of the 'Group of Friends', which brings together in New York the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, the ASEAN Chair, India, Japan and Norway, which are all involved in monitoring the situation in Burma.
The EU Special Envoy for Burma, Mr Fassino, plays a key role in supporting Mr Gambari's mission.
That is the information I wanted to pass on to you on behalf of Mrs Ferrero-Waldner.
<D>
Mr President, I welcome the proposals from the Commission.
This time last year I visited my own constituency in Castletownbere.
At that time, in July 2007, fishermen were in a fairly bad state as regards the whole industry.
Twelve months on, we are now facing up to the problems, and I welcome the proposals that are set out by the Commission here today.
However, there is also a need for a response from Member States in other areas in relation to the whole fishing industry.
The whole issue which you have raised in your own memorandum about quantity, quality and supply is a very important one and is about making sure that the people who produce and supply the fish get an adequate reward for the work that they do.
I think at the end of the day, while the consumer may be paying, it is people in-between who are making quite a large part of the profit from it.
I think one of the things that we need to change is the whole area of voluntary labelling.
We need to bring in that mechanism so that we can clearly identify the product that comes from outside the European Union and, in many cases, the product that is not caught in compliance with the regulations that are laid down.
I think there needs to be change in that area.
There is too much product coming into the EU which is not properly caught in accordance with regulations, and we are not doing enough in that area to make sure that we do have a level playing field for all the people within the EU.
I think that is a major area that we need to work on.
While I welcome these regulations and these proposals, I think we also need to implement the regulations that are there for the product that is coming in from outside the European Union.
<D>
The Member States in particular have some catching up to do when it comes to the protection of non-smokers.
Our central concern must be to protect vulnerable groups such as children and pregnant women.
However, the European Union has no direct authority in this area.
Health care is, and remains, a matter for the Member States and the countries must take on responsibility for these issues.
The EU should therefore focus on what it can do to protect non-smokers, which means protecting employees in the workplace.
However, attempting to achieve the fundamental aim of making Europe smoke-free by introducing a large number of regulations to protect workers is not a satisfactory solution to the problem.
In order to protect as many sections of the population as possible and, in particular, children from the harmful effects of tobacco smoke, we need more campaigns to raise public awareness.
This is the only effective means of changing the way in which people in Europe think in the long term and this is the only solution to reducing smoking in the private sphere.
(The sitting was suspended at 19.30 and resumed at 21.00)
<D>
The ECB Annual Report 2008 reflects the causes and circumstances of the crisis well.
The year 2008, which saw the beginning of the acute phase of the biggest economic crisis for several decades, determined the ways in which the world economy and the European economy would develop for a long time to come.
For the European Central Bank, the last two years were, without doubt, the most difficult period in its history.
The ECB had to tackle a crisis which had hit the European economy severely.
Rising budget deficits in Member States combined with growing debt are the primary macro-economic consequences of the crisis.
In accordance with the treaty, the ECB is primarily responsible for 'price stability', which means low inflation.
Has the ECB fulfilled its role?
It is hard to be sure.
It is true that the current level of inflation is below the ceiling fixed by the ECB, but it should be pointed out that in the first months of the crisis it jumped to its highest ever level in the euro area, only to fall, suddenly, later.
I think, however, that this instability can be explained by the surprise which the crisis caused.
From October 2008 onwards, the ECB's monetary policy can be described as active and flexible.
The ECB adopted a different strategy for the crisis than other leading central banks around the world.
We are still waiting for the results of these actions.
Europe is coming out of the crisis, but the situation is still uncertain.
Is the ECB ready for the possibility of another crisis, a possibility which is seen by some economists?
<D>
Madam President, let me first congratulate Mrs Oomen-Ruijten on her report and also her cooperation throughout this time.
The report sends a clear message to Turkey that its path towards Europe and its ultimate entry into the European family will pass through the following stages.
Firstly, it must continue to strengthen reforms in all its sectors and structures.
Secondly, it must show complete and absolute respect for human rights and the rights of minorities.
Thirdly, Turkish troops must withdraw from Cyprus, and there must be a contribution towards a fair and lasting solution to the Cyprus issue.
Now is the time for all of us to lend our support to President Christofias's initiatives in this direction.
Fourthly, Turkey must maintain good neighbourly relations in general, and with Greece in particular.
This means that violations of the Flight Information Region must stop, as must provocations of all kinds.
Of course, there are forces in Turkey wanting destabilisation, whereas some Turkish citizens hope for a more democratic, progressive, developed, environmentally conscious, socially aware, peace-loving and Europe-oriented Turkey.
These citizens need to be given the message that their struggles are not in vain, and this is what Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's report achieves, as does the discussion we are holding here today.
<D>
(LT) I would like to congratulate France for presiding so splendidly in the last six months.
The world financial crisis, the conflict between Russia and Georgia, and relations between the EU and China have been just a few of the challenges.
This has been the context of these six months and we must recognise that France has performed the role of EU President effectively and impressively.
I would like to express a few thoughts on the European Neighbourhood Policy, in particular the Eastern Partnership, which was discussed at the EU Council in October and last week in Brussels.
The events in Georgia are a clear example of how the European Union can act at the epicentre of events and how it can influence them positively.
Most importantly, it also shows how the European Union can be united and show solidarity.
Another example is Belarus, which for many years now has not been able to take advantage of the opportunities of the European Neighbourhood Policy.
I would like to stress that this autumn changes have also been observed in Belarus which offer hope that relations between the EU and Belarus can be qualitatively different; they can be truly neighbourly relations.
The opportunities to cooperate are very real if the Belarus leadership realises its obligations regarding freedom of the press, elections, the Internet and other issues mentioned to us.
Today President Sarkozy said, and I quote: 'I have tried to make Europe move, but over the last six months Europe has actually changed me.
I have become more tolerant and open' (end of quote).
Ladies and gentlemen, it seems to me that Europe helps many people change, ourselves included and, as for Belarus, even the leader of that country, Alexander Lukashenko.
This is great.
<D>
Under the guise of combating mafia organisations and organised crime in general, the Eurocrats of Brussels wish to further impose their federalist views, which destroy nations, peoples and identities.
Indeed, while everyone knows that each EU Member State has its own laws, legal traditions, and codes, here we have yet another assault by these fanatical Euro-federalists, in the shape of their desire to create a 'European judicial culture'.
In order to establish this culture, the following should accordingly be created: a European Judicial School, an academy of European law for judges, prosecutors, defence lawyers, and all others involved in the administration of justice.
What about national judicial schools?
What about the inextricable differences between the legislations deriving from common law and those from written law?
No answer is given, obviously.
In practice, it will be the entire judicial and penal systems of the Member States that will disappear in the face of this forced harmonisation - downwards harmonisation, that is.
These sorcerer's apprentices of Europe's have not understood a thing; only the nation states, Europe's main components, will be able to enrich it and to restore it to its rightful place in the world.
Europe must not be built at the expense of its nations and its peoples.
<D>
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development. - Mr President, I would like to congratulate my colleague, Mr Szymański, on his very good report.
On behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, I welcome the inclusion of cross-border cooperation within the scope of the ENPI Regulation as an instrument to develop common projects and to strengthen relations between ENP countries and EU Member States.
At the same time, I would like to highlight the necessity of regularly monitoring the management and implementation of joint operational programmes on both sides of EU borders.
Cross-border cooperation should contribute to integrated sustainable development between neighbouring regions.
We ask the Commission to prepare a detailed overview of all joint operational programmes approved for the current financial period, with an assessment of how the principles of transparency, efficiency and partnership have been respected.
Such an assessment, together with an inventory of the most frequent problems faced by the managing authorities, should contribute to finding more appropriate solutions for the next programming period.
I would also encourage the Commission to facilitate the exchange of experiences and best practices in cross-border cooperation between ENP programmes and projects, on the one hand, and actions taken under the European Territorial Cooperation objective and under the already completed Interreg IIIA Community Initiative, on the other.
Finally, the Regional Development Committee considers that ENPI should focus on a balanced strategy between the east and the south, with specific approaches for both areas.
<D>
(FR) Mr President, the rationale behind the European Institute of Technology is a fair one: namely that research is central to any economic progress.
Research depends on scientists educated at leading universities.
Universities must be able to count on significant and foreseeable public and private funding.
The European Union is lagging behind in all of these areas.
Our funds for research are, on average across the EU, way below the public - and especially private - research budgets of Japan and the US.
The EU - population 500 million - employs 1.2 million scientists.
The US - population 300 million - has 1.3 million.
On average in Europe, public and private funding for higher education represents 1.3% of GDP, compared with 3.3% in the US.
Europe spends less than EUR 10 000 per student, the US more than EUR 35 000.
However, all is not a bed of roses on the other side of the Atlantic.
Out of 2 500 universities, only around 100 are truly excellent and these share EUR 32 billion each year of research funding.
This figure should be compared with the paltry funds proposed for the EIT.
If our governments do not set aside more money for research, the EIT and other schemes will fall by the wayside.
Each year, the US produces some 40 000 doctors.
One third come from the rest of the world.
In physical and life sciences, the proportion of non-Americans is more than 50%.
Why is this the case?
Because the US still believes in scientific progress.
Where Europeans are quick to see risks and hide fearfully behind the precautionary principle, Americans see new opportunities.
This applies to biotechnologies, nanotechnologies, even when it comes to tackling climate change.
While Europe focuses on regrets, the US extols technological and scientific progress.
Fear of the future and fear of progress are at the root of Europe's failings.
Without a change in attitude, Mr President, the EIT will not make any difference.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, let me first thank Mr Remek and the ITRE Committee for having worked so much on a topic which is of utmost importance, because it is true that through ICT we can make a major contribution towards combating climate issues and achieving a 20% reduction in both consumption and carbon emissions.
It is a huge challenge, we know, but it is not insurmountable and can only be achieved if we know how to use ICT.
That is why the Commission is not talking but acting in the following way.
Firstly, we have been working on a communication on a comprehensive strategy for ICT to address our energy and climate problems.
This strategy will be accompanied by a recommendation in which we set the tasks, the targets and the timeline for actions in the ICT sector, actions by stakeholders and by Member States.
These actions aim to accelerate the adoption of ICT as an enabler so that we can master the energy demands of our homes, of our businesses, and of our society at large.
Now, at what level?
Firstly, of course, at the level of ICT products themselves.
Their carbon footprint is of absolute importance and I know that the industry is working on this.
We hope this work will be achieved by investing in research.
The second level is ICT as an enabler across the board and in all sectors of economic activity.
We need incentives here in order to change behaviour - as the rapporteur said, 'penser autrement' - but this will only happen in governments, in administrations, in businesses, and for citizens, if they understand what potential there is for making savings.
That means we have to measure what we have now and what we do better.
If we do not measure, we will not have results, and that is why we need a baseline against which improvements can be measured.
The challenge of measurement and of quantification will be at the heart of our proposal.
Also at the heart of this proposal is how we proceed from research results to innovation and practical achievements.
Of course, we started with research.
The Commission's R&TD funding programmes aim to exploit this potential in the systems and infrastructures for services too.
The most significant results are expected in areas such as electricity distribution, buildings, transport logistics and lighting.
The rapporteur is right: you need to have cross-sectoral participation in those projects.
That is also why we established cross-sectoral research projects and worked very closely together with the industry to reduce the time between research and development and innovation.
That is also the reason why, in our innovation programmes, we supported the demonstration and validation of new solutions and technologies in real world settings in order to maximise their set-up.
Reducing the footprint of ICT products also forms part of this research.
As regards funding, we have so far invested more than EUR 4 000 million in this initiative.
In the recovery plan proposed by the Commission, public/private partnerships for R&D are high on the agenda, with one of the three initiatives we propose being energy efficient buildings, a domain where ICT will of course play a predominant role.
One of the pilot projects being put into action now is the intelligent transport system.
We have already invested a lot in in-car intelligent systems and we are now moving to the next step, which is the relationship between the car and the road and traffic signs.
I agree with the rapporteur here that it will be very important to have our own satellite programme to become more efficient in that respect.
<D>
in writing. - (PL) 2008 is the year of ratification of the Lisbon Treaty, which is to come into force in 2009.
It will give the European Union new powers and will have a significant impact on the Community budget.
The newly constituted Parliament and Commission will have to deal with a completely new budget procedure, to which the 2010 budget will be subject.
For this reason it is exceptionally important to have clear agreement on changes to the relevant budgetary and legislative instruments by the end of this year in order to ensure a transparent framework for 2010.
In addition, we need to intensify preparations for a wide-ranging review of all aspects of EU expenditure to enable the Commission to submit a report by the end of this year.
The solidarity principle must be a priority for next year, but finances have to be guaranteed to ensure its implementation.
What worries me is that, given the room for manoeuvre available within the ceilings fixed by the multiannual financial frameworks, the Commission's already existing priorities and the new priorities it has set cannot in practice be achieved simultaneously without the former suffering.
For this reason the initial budget proposal should give a realistic picture of all the requirements for next year, taking into account Parliament's demand that all amounts allocated to pilot projects that are of general benefit to Europe's citizens should be spent.
<D>
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) Mr President, when I was discussing the original version of the strategy with an expert in the Czech Republic, he made just one comment: 'too little, too late'.
I would like to congratulate and thank the rapporteur for improving this outlook and for managing to give the text of this strategy a very positive direction.
I would like to stress the following points in particular.
Firstly, the amended text takes a positive attitude to the fact that it is necessary to spend more money on information and prevention programs to combat alcoholism.
Secondly, the strategy focuses on young people, who represent a category that is particularly at risk.
In this context, I welcome and support in particular Article 7 on university students and Article 16, which makes it obligatory to include warnings on labels.
Thirdly, I believe that the text of Article 21, which draws attention to the relationship between sick leave and alcohol consumption, is very important.
We must not forget that if the European workforce is affected by alcohol, it will not be very competitive in a global world.
I have a few doubts about the text of Article 2, which refers to a study by the World Health Organisation about the usefulness of alcohol in prevention of some diseases.
With due respect to the WHO, I would like to point out that there are expert analyses available on this topic, such as the study by the team lead by Mrs Fillmore that was published in 2006: these studies show that analysis of the benefits of alcohol was based on the wrong data and that it also included, for example, older people who have stopped drinking and casual drinkers.
The findings of this study are therefore fairly problematic.
There is also the question of the message we want to convey to citizens with this text in Article 2.
I hope that the message is not that if alcohol is drunk in small quantities, no amount will prove harmful.
Although I have made this one criticism, I very much support the strategy, that is, the text that was amended in mutual cooperation with the rapporteur, and I believe that it will be beneficial for our fellow citizens.
<D>
(SK) Madam Chairman, thank you for giving me the floor.
The common position adopted by the Council does not include the amendments concerning free postal services for blind people in spite of the fact that at first reading the European Parliament voted to maintain free postal services for blind people following liberalisation of the European postal market.
I intended to vote in favour of Amendment 3 tabled by Eva Lichtenberger, in which Parliament's position at first reading is reiterated.
Following today's discussion with the rapporteur, Marcus Ferber, I was informed that approval of any of the amendments would jeopardise a previously agreed compromise on the adoption of the Directive on accomplishment of the internal market in Community postal services at second reading, which could mean having to enter into conciliation.
I realise the importance of adopting this Directive.
When transposed into national law, the Member States will be able to solve this issue in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity.
I would therefore urge all of the Member States to provide free postal services for blind and partially sighted people in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity and universal service obligations.
<D>
This is my interpretation having, believe me, listened to you very carefully.
The way in which the request from the forty petitioners is worded does not mention the issue of Kashmir, but all the urgencies, all the urgencies this afternoon, including the death penalty.
This is an important matter.
We can have the debates without any problem, Mrs Gill is right.
The issue solely concerns the vote, but I wanted to have this debate from the start so that there would not be ambiguity all afternoon.
I think that the reason why Parliament took the trouble to write Rule 149(4), stating that the Members who have asked for the quorum to be checked shall be counted, in accordance with paragraph 2, even if they are not in the Chamber, as Mr Posselt said, I think that this Rule was written solely to prevent Members from leaving the Chamber at the time of the count, which implies that they were present at the start of the count.
As I cannot see that the forty petitioners are present at the start of the count - unless, as Mrs Gill says, they are all present later at voting time, which we will check, in which case there will be a quorum request - I will follow the precedents set by the other presidents of sittings who, like me, have been faced with this problem, by saying that the quorum request cannot be validated because the forty petitioners are not present.
Having said that, Mr Leinen was right to draw our attention to the fact that the way in which paragraph 4 is written could cause confusion.
This is why I think that this is a very good time - and it is not up to me to decide this, but to the competent bodies - for the Committee that you chair, Jo, to clarify very quickly whether or not paragraph 3 states that the Members have to be present when they submit their quorum request, and whether or not the Members have to be present when the count is done, at the start of the count.
I think that the interpretation of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs will get us out of a tricky situation.
However, as far as today is concerned, given the importance of the debates, and given the opinions that you have given me, which clearly largely support what I have just said, and on the basis of the previous decisions, we are going to have our debates, and when it comes to the vote, if the forty petitioners are not present, I will not ask for the quorum to be checked.
The debates will therefore begin.
<D>
author. - Mr President, Commissioner, two years ago, following the removal of the quotas, the textile sector experienced a veritable big bang.
To try to cope with the crisis, Commissioner, you were recommending temporary palliative measures with the aim of controlling and restricting imports of some Chinese textiles.
In a few days time, these safeguards will no longer exist and trade in textiles will be subject to joint European Union/Chinese surveillance, which I hope will be attentive and vigilant.
Today, our concern is about the way this system of joint surveillance will be set up.
What guarantees do we have that this twin checking system will be both adequate and effective?
The textiles sector is one that has always been globalist, both in terms of production and consumption, but it is one that has paid the price for globalisation.
However, globalisation can be anticipated and regulated.
For this to happen there needs to be the political will to set up a competitive framework for our European textile industries.
We need to work towards fair and reciprocal conditions of market access.
We need to continue to be fearless in using the instruments at the EU's disposal to defend our trade; being protective is not the same thing as being protectionist.
We need to prioritise the fight against counterfeiting.
The Europe of tomorrow will no longer have any industry if we do not stand up for its intellectual copyrights and expertise.
Having the same rules applied by everyone for everyone is the only way of offering all of the parties concerned a win-win scenario.
I therefore wish for 2008, Mr Mandelson, that together we can consider the textile sector's bright future in a more peaceful climate.
<D>
(PL) Mr President, it is not so long ago that the European Union's main concern was the overproduction of food, and our debates were mainly concentrated on how to produce less.
Separating subsidies off from production, eliminating export premiums and maintaining production quotas all helped to restrict the potential of European agriculture.
Reality verified this policy.
The first signs of a food crisis have appeared more rapidly than anyone could have expected.
Foodstuffs are becoming more expensive, we have less and less food of our own, and imports are becoming increasingly expensive and increasingly less secure.
These are in large measure the consequences of that policy, which is based on persuading agriculture to produce less.
We must radically alter our approach to agricultural policy.
We must recognise that agriculture is one of the pillars of European security.
Alongside physical security and energy security, food security is a fundamental security pillar that is important for both peoples and states and for every individual.
Let us stop playing around with agriculture.
Let us recognise it as a pillar of our security, and let us follow that up by supporting it so that Europe's food security is assured, and so that food is accessible to all.
<D>
Let me point out that the increasing stir this issue is causing and the warnings given through the RASFF prove that the system is really working.
In the case of Greece and the Ukrainian sunflower oil, a general warning was indeed issued 23 April 2008 that this contaminated sunflower oil was on the EU market.
On 5 May 2008, when the Swiss authorities issued a specific warning to our centre here that this sunflower oil was on its way to Greece, Italy and Turkey, among other places, the Greek authorities made the necessary investigations and began to give us the information and withdraw the products.
I wish to stress, however, that we should not confuse the measures the European Commission has the authority to take, and is taking, with the obligations of the Member States, as these are internal affairs.
Of course, you will ask me whether any checks are carried out.
Yes, they are.
The FVO service, which makes periodic visits to various Member States, checks that the departments are operating, identifies any shortcomings and points them out to the Member States.
Naturally, this happens both in Greece and in other countries.
<D>
Madam President, first of all I would like to congratulate the Commission and its President on the presentation and the proposal here and to welcome it.
I come from a country where we have proved those goals are achievable - although we do not have very much sun anyway - but it is possible to achieve those goals.
And now we are, as has been said today, making the overall goals into concrete actions and measures - that is good.
I have three points.
First, competitiveness needs sustainability - but sustainability needs competitiveness.
If we are to be a competitive economy in the future, we need to have competitive energy sources, and that also goes for the renewables.
We need to have competition between different renewables, not a regulated economy with subsidies for different renewables.
We need to have fair and open competition, because then we will see the second and third generation of renewables emerge, and we will have good use of them.
The second point is that high charges for some countries must not lead to less responsibility for other countries.
I must say on that point I feel a little bit uncomfortable because, maybe, some countries are getting away a little bit too easily.
We need to underline this because everyone needs to make those efforts.
Thirdly, this is about renewables, but I would still like to underline the importance of nuclear power, not because I look upon nuclear power as one of the renewables, but it is my belief that, if we are to take full advantage and make full use of renewables, we must not get into a situation where the phasing-out of nuclear power consumes the achievements we can make in the fight against carbon dioxide emissions.
We need both of them, and they will support each other.
Those are my three points today.
I welcome the proposal and presentation, and wish us all good luck.
<D>
Europe will not succeed in combating the increasing poverty and global warming - the major challenges of globalisation - if it constantly puts the emphasis on liberalisation.
Indeed, it is free trade that causes these problems.
Globalisation creates the illusion that the general level of prosperity in the world is gradually increasing, but at the same time I note a steady increase in the gap between rich and poor in the Member States.
Liberalisation is also the cause of the great environmental disaster that lies ahead unless we hasten to take decisive, enforceable measures to combat global warming.
Lacking a vigorous policy in this field is criminally irresponsible.
Investing in an energy-efficient economy and creating jobs in that area is nevertheless a promising course of action.
The 'polluter pays' principle is disregarded all too frequently.
As a Member of the Group of the Greens/ European Free Alliance I regret the absence of this input.
If Europe wants a single market with free movement of people, goods, services and capital, it should also lay down high social and environmental standards that offer protection and set an example to the rest of the world.
The proposed text remains vague and superficial and once again typifies the Commission's policy.
<D>
on behalf of the EFD Group. - I speak tonight because, as has been mentioned, two constituents - Michael Turner and Jason McGoldrick - are imprisoned in Unit 2 of the Central Budapest jail in Hungary.
They have been imprisoned since 3 November and they are yet to be tried.
There is, in fact, no trial date.
The terms of imprisonment are burdensome.
They are separated and have no contact with each other.
They share a small cell with three other prisoners.
They are confined to their cells 23 hours a day.
They are permitted three telephone calls and one shower a week.
They are allowed one family visit per month.
In short, they are isolated.
The language barrier makes the isolation worse.
They are accused of a white-collar crime.
They are not murderers or terrorists.
And they are imprisoned only because of the European Arrest Warrant.
The European Arrest Warrant swept away, at a stroke, the safeguards against arrest established in Britain over a thousand years.
Well may you shake your head, Mr Watson: it would be better if you apologised.
Mistaken identity and identity theft mean that what has happened to Jason and Michael can now also happen to any British citizen at any time.
The Labour Party, the Liberal Democrats and the Conservative Party all voted in favour of a European arrest warrant.
To restate Zola, 'J'accuse' - I accuse - the parties of the British political establishment: their support for the European Arrest Warrant has put everyone in Britain at risk of random arrest.
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Mr Topolánek, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, after leading our US partners and the rest of the world from the start of the crisis in an ambitious, but truly necessary, reform of the financial markets, last Friday Europe established a road map for the G20 of 2 April.
During yesterday's debate on the G20, some Members said that this was not enough; others said that it was too much.
The reality is that, in the successive crises that we have just experienced, Europe has been there, has coordinated itself, has worked as a team.
I repeat: in the crisis situation that we are experiencing, as with all the global issues - energy, climate change, foreign affairs, security and defence - national solutions are no longer suitable.
If even the UK Prime Minister, whom we heard yesterday, extols the virtues of the European Union, declaring himself, I quote, 'proud to be British and proud to be European', I feel secure in my belief.
The decision taken by the European Council last week to put in place a EUR 50 billion fund to help Member States outside the euro zone in this difficult period is a good thing, since what affects one of us affects us all.
This is the meaning of European integration.
When added to the EUR 400 billion of the European economic recovery plan, these appropriations will help to re-establish growth conditions and to create wealth and, ultimately, jobs.
The same is true of the EUR 5 billion package that we have decided to invest in order to support projects in the area of energy and measures linked to the Internet and other issues.
I call on the Council to do its utmost to ensure that an agreement is reached by the end of this parliamentary term on the three major issues currently on the table: credit rating agencies, directives on regulatory capital requirements and the Solvency II Directive.
On this last text, the Council must step up a gear to ensure that it can be adopted at first reading, in April.
Ladies and gentlemen, we do not need any more socialist economic measures.
We need more jobs, and this package of measures will allow this.
Furthermore, I note with interest that not one European leader on the left or on the right backed socialist measures in Brussels last week.
That also confirms my feeling that there is not always a great deal of consistency between what is being said currently by the Chairman of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and what is being done by socialist-led governments, and, Mr Schulz, you still have a lot of work to do to convince your political friend, Mr Steinbrück, to become more social.
I should also like to mention the preparation for the Copenhagen Conference in December and to ask the Czech Presidency to draft some proposals on international finance mechanisms by June.
With regard to the energy and climate change package, Europe has set the tone and must not lose its advantage.
Climate change will not wait for the end of the crisis.
It is therefore our responsibility to convince our partners to take our lead in combating climate change and to adopt the objective of a 30% reduction in CO2 emissions.
Barack Obama seems to have decided to accept the helping hand we were offering him by deciding to implement an emissions quota exchange system in the United States.
To conclude, I wish to express my satisfaction that Europe is finally taking our neighbours in the East seriously by adopting a strategic partnership with Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine.
This partnership will be a useful addition to the work of the EURONEST Assembly, the initiative for which came from my group and which will come into existence with the agreement of all the parliamentary groups, from the next parliamentary term.
On the other hand, it is high time the Union for the Mediterranean, which was set up last summer, got its secretariat moving in Barcelona and worked on concrete projects.
The 27 requested this last week; we expect to have a road map in June.
<D>
in writing. - (PL) Illegal immigration is a somewhat paradoxical notion.
I grew up under a political system in which certain terms were deemed to be a priori positive or negative by those in power and their propaganda.
For instance, international was classed as positive but cosmopolitan as negative.
We must guard against falling into a similar semantic trap.
Since xenophobia is bad, one can hardly consider that it is a very good thing for a country or the European Union to protect itself against illegal immigration.
It is surely more of a necessary evil.
I saw the words 'Nobody is illegal' painted on a wall in my home town of Poznań.
It is sometimes worth pausing to consider whether a human being can actually be illegal.
It is not only on the Atlantic and the Mediterranean that people put their lives at risk attempting to cross the Union's borders.
Last week a Chechen woman and her three young daughters died on the border between Ukraine and Poland.
They were fleeing from the tragedy that has befallen their homeland.
It is hardly surprising that people are trying to escape from Chechnya, and are even prepared to risk their lives to do so.
The presence of several million immigrants in Europe, who entered the Union illegally, is a very real problem.
As we strive to resolve it, however, we must keep in mind the universal values that underpin European integration.
We must also remember that immigration itself is not a negative phenomenon, for the very simple reason that no human being is a negative phenomenon.
<D>
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the outcome of the last European Council will be written in the history of the EU.
It is rare for a European Council to have to take so many decisions on such basic political issues.
Rarely has Europe been able to express its satisfaction at so many positive results, and even a threefold success.
In a difficult and even urgent crisis situation, we have managed to make considerable progress for the future of Europe and Europeans.
That is the Europe to which we are all so attached: a Europe that is capable of the best.
In addition to other important conclusions, particularly relating to security and defence policy, the Union for the Mediterranean and the new Eastern Partnership, I would like to emphasise three particular fields: the Treaty of Lisbon, economic recovery, and energy and climate change.
The 27 Member States have worked together to find a common path to continue the political process towards the Treaty of Lisbon.
We in the European Commission have always supported this Treaty, and we had reason to think that, by taking the time to listen to the concerns of our Irish friends, together we would be able to find the elements for a solution.
In a positive response to the Commission's initiative of 26 November, 27 Member States decided to coordinate their economic recovery plans to weather an unusually severe storm.
Today, we have an agreement on a boost to the economy of around 1.5% of the EU's GDP, as the Commission recommended.
This coordinated plan will tackle the recession, in particular with more help for the most vulnerable people in society.
At the same time, it will enable us to invest in our economies to adapt them to future challenges.
This means that this crisis will give us the opportunity to increase investment in social Europe and in a Europe of reform.
Following on from the legislative proposals presented by the Commission on 23 January 2008, and on the basis of a strong contribution from the European Parliament, 27 Member States unanimously agreed to make a commitment to transform Europe into a green, low-energy economy for future generations.
The agreement on our energy and climate policy sticks to the objective of achieving '3 times 20%' by 2020.
This historic breakthrough, if it is confirmed in this House tomorrow, signals a victory for Europe as a partner, in other words for European institutions that have worked hand in hand with the Member States in a spirit of cooperation and with a strong common will to succeed.
I would like, at this point, to reiterate our gratitude to the French Presidency of the Council for the success of Europe as a partner.
Mr President, your Presidency has seen some exceptionally intense political circumstances, as you reminded us just now: the unprecedented financial crisis, and the war between Russia and Georgia.
Your Presidency faced these problems effectively, calmly and, dare I say it, with flair and panache.
France is back in Europe, you said on the evening of your election, and we do not doubt it for a minute: I would even say that we have not had a moment to doubt it, about which we are delighted.
I would therefore like to congratulate most sincerely President Sarkozy and the French Presidency's entire team: the members of his government, the diplomats and the experts.
You have done an outstanding job.
On behalf of Europe, thank you.
(Applause)
Staying with the success of Europe as a partner, I would also like to say that I am very proud of the central role played by the Commission, of its ability to take the political initiative based on solid technical preparation, and of the relevance of its proposals.
The Commission has proven that it is still the indispensable lever in transforming political dreams into real action.
It was on the basis of the Commission's proposals on energy and climate change, starting at Hampton Court in the autumn of 2005, via the political agreement on the objectives in March 2007 and under the German Presidency, and ending up with the legislative proposals in January 2008, that the Member States were able to reach a unanimous agreement.
It was also on the basis of proposals made by the Commission on 29 October and 26 November that the Member States managed to reach agreement on a joint recovery plan.
The strong support for these proposals has enabled us to begin a new era in Europe, and I would stress that, without the Presidency's commitment to a more political Europe, it would have been very difficult, if not impossible, to achieve these commitments.
Bear in mind that I have worked with nine Presidents of the European Council and I can tell you how difficult it is, these days, to reach a consensus between 27 Member States who, quite naturally, sometimes have differing priorities.
That is why we need this spirit of partnership in Europe.
Finally, still on the success of Europe as a partner, I would also like to pay real tribute to the fantastic work that the European Parliament has done over recent months, particularly on the climate change package.
Nothing would have been possible without Parliament's commitment and without the tireless work of your rapporteurs, committee chairmen and coordinators of political groups.
The final compromise that emerged from the trialogues this weekend evidently bears the hallmark of this commitment, be it on the emissions trading scheme, the division of labour, renewable energy or carbon capture and storage, in which connection the arguments put forward by Parliament have made it possible to increase the quota volume available for this funding to 300 million tonnes.
Since the beginning, the European Parliament has shown that it understands the global context: it is a project for Europe, yes, but it also involves a contribution to global efforts and the cornerstone of our strategy with a view to the Copenhagen negotiations next year.
I therefore hope that tomorrow's plenary sitting will approve, by a large majority, the result of this work.
You, the European Parliament, hold the final key to the final door that will allow a Europe of the 21st century to take flight.
Europe will be the first global player to accept legally binding rules to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020, whilst making clear commitment to aim for 30% as part of an international agreement.
By adopting this agreement by a very large majority, Parliament will be sending a very strong message to our partners.
We also need the commitment of our partners, particularly our US partners, which is why, as I said at the end of the European Council, now that we Europeans are taking the lead on this matter, we can say to our US friends: 'Yes you can!
We can; yes, you can!'
That is the message we need to send to the United States so that, with us, they can work to achieve a real global agreement.
The world around us is changing and so is Europe.
Together we have taken a number of crucial decisions in order to give the European Union the means to succeed in the age of globalisation, to protect citizens from the fallout of an economic and financial crisis, to create the conditions for a return to sustainable growth and also to lead the efforts for a reform of the financial system and for global governance.
We have come a long way over the last few months in addressing these challenges but - let us be clear - a lot still remains to be done in the weeks and months to come.
On climate change, we now need to turn our attention to the road to Copenhagen.
On global governance, and especially on the reform of the financial system, we need to prepare the G20 summit in London.
On the economic recovery plan, we need to translate political agreement into concrete action.
In all these areas, continued close cooperation between the Community institutions will remain key to success.
In particular, with regard to the financial and economic crisis, we will need the backing of Parliament and Council as co-legislators and budgetary authority.
I will have the opportunity to discuss this in more detail with the European Parliament's Conference of Presidents tomorrow morning, but let me now give you a brief glimpse of what lies ahead.
With regard to the Community budget, we will step up advance payments from early 2009 so that Member States have earlier access to up to EUR 1.8 billion.
Today the Commission will adopt a proposal to adapt the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund to the current situation and to facilitate access.
With regard to the use of unspent money from the Community budget, the European Council has given the Commission the green light to propose a reallocation for trans-European energy interconnection and broadband infrastructure projects and to promote energy efficiency.
We envisage an amount of EUR 5 billion for 2009 and 2010.
An important sum will be reserved for the demonstration projects in carbon capture and storage, complementing financing under the emissions trading system.
I rely on this Parliament's support to convince all those who still resist the use of these unspent funds.
I trust the French presidency to turn the clear political conclusions of the European Council into reality.
Let us be clear about this.
It is important that the ambition that was shown by the European Council is now accepted at all levels of the decision-making process.
In order to accelerate investments by Member States, the Commission will also this week propose a temporary exemption of two years beyond the de minimis threshold for state aid, up to EUR 500 000.
I would also like to mention the use for 2009 and 2010 of accelerated procedures in the public procurement directives, given the current exceptional circumstances.
But let me be clear.
While the current crisis calls for an acceleration of procedures, it can under no circumstances serve as a pretext for suspending competition or state aid rules, which are the backbone of our single market.
We need to keep the integrity of our internal market.
This is one of the most important European achievements - as is, by the way, the euro.
That is why we need to keep the Stability and Growth Pact and the internal market rules if we want to have a European response that is really European.
The Commission will also make sure that Member States respect their commitment to pursue their national efforts in a coordinated manner.
We will do so via our well-tested instruments - the Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs, and the Stability and Growth Pact.
We are living in extraordinary times which require extraordinary measures.
The French presidency has played a crucial role in short-term crisis management, as well as in putting Europe on the path towards long-term recovery and a return to sustainable growth, but a lot remains to be done over the coming months.
I trust that, by maintaining a Europe of partnership between the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Council, we will succeed, to the benefit of all Europeans.
<D>
The current situation is that young people tend to be more adept at the use of new technologies than the older generation.
The Internet holds no secrets for children and young people, who are generally better informed than their parents about how it works.
At the same time, however, it is children and young people who are most at risk from psychological violence on the Internet.
According to data gathered in a campaign on children's use of the Internet, half of all Poles using the Internet have been the victims of insults, humiliation and threats on the Internet.
The situation is even more serious where children are concerned.
More than 70% of young Internet users have accessed pornographic or erotic material, and more than half of them have viewed cruel and violent scenes.
It should be emphasised, however, that a large majority of these young people came across this material by chance, and did not access it deliberately.
Only 12% of children admitted to searching for sites of this sort.
I am quoting these statistics in the Chamber to impress upon Members the gravity of the danger to which our youngest citizens are exposed, using my country as an example.
I therefore believe that the planned programme for the protection of children absolutely must be implemented.
<D>
(EL) Madam President, the report and the initiative in general which we are debating today is necessary, but I am afraid that it is of dubious efficacy.
It is more of a shot in the arm than a therapy.
Europe had to do something, because this is a serious crisis and it had to do something, but I think that this is not up to the challenge.
Firstly, it is not much money for the crisis we are going through and there is no guarantee that it will reach those who need it most.
Both energy and broadband Internet are important sectors, but we cannot be sure that they are the top priority sectors and, more importantly, the sectors that will generate the additional jobs and growth that we need.
Secondly, as all my fellow Members have said, we still do not know if, when and where a large part, almost half of the money, some 2.4 billion, will come from.
The other day we were talking in the Committee on Budgets to Commissioner Kallas, who is unable at present to give us an answer as to where the appropriations will come from.
Thirdly and perhaps most importantly, we are providing solutions which will not help us to address the problems in the long term.
It is no solution to keep taking the money left over from agricultural policy; it is no solution to shift the balances underground between agricultural and regional policy and the Union's other needs.
Europe needs a global plan in the face of the crisis, which it does not appear to have at present.
I am afraid that this opportunity has been lost for the European Union and I am afraid that it has been lost mainly by the Commission itself.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - In relation to border controls, customs controls must balance the protection of a range of EU financial, safety and security interests with the interests of legitimate traders.
For this reason, a Community risk management framework was developed enabling customs controls for security and safety to be carried out on the basis of common risk criteria and standards.
In the EU, 1.5 million tonnes of sea cargo and 12 million tonnes of air cargo are checked each year.
Under Article 209(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Member States' customs services are responsible for the application of the EU legislation concerned.
Therefore, they are in charge of organising customs controls at physical frontiers and elsewhere on the basis of risk management techniques as specified in the EU's Customs Code.
With regard to cigarette smuggling, the Commission plays an active role in helping Member States to tackle the phenomenon of international cigarette smuggling and to dismantle the criminal gangs responsible for this trade.
In particular, the European Anti-Fraud Office assists law enforcement authorities throughout the European Union with their operational cases and coordinates major customs and criminal investigations with the Member States and third countries.
Using the provisions of European mutual assistance in customs matters and a number of agreements concluded between the EU and third countries, OLAF organises joint customs operations between EU Member States and with third countries aimed at targeting specific problems, such as Operation Matthew II, targeting road traffic on the eastern border, or Operation Sirocco, focused on deep-sea container transports from China to the Union.
Finally, OLAF provides financial support to Member States from the Hercule II programme for measures specifically targeting cigarette smuggling, such as the purchase of specialist x-ray scanning equipment to be used at border points and the organisation of regional actions.
Moreover, cooperation agreements were signed with British American Tobacco and Imperial Tobacco Limited in 2010, and agreements were signed with Philip Morris International and Japan Tobacco International in 2004 and 2007 respectively.
These legally binding agreements provide a comprehensive set of measures designed to limit the presence of the products of these companies on the illicit tobacco market.
<D>
in writing. - As a co-author of this resolution, I am in support of the realistic intentions of the TEC process.
It is necessary for the EU and the USA to undertake this search for barrier-reducing initiatives.
In particular I welcome the steady progress that has been made on financial services, IFRS and the broker/dealer agreement.
More has to be done and other avenues should be explored, including the multilateral approach.
I am concerned, however, that both sides should not wait for remedies which may or may not close differences between us.
This will take hard work instead, and this is no more apparent than in the area of insurance and, in particular, the collateral issue.
The TEC is not a trade issue per se.
It is about a deepening of our relationship at the regulatory level which improves the openness and efficiency of our industrial performances and which does away with the weak excuses of the past.
We now face a mounting challenge in the world where the interest for the EU and the USA is in having systems which promote growth rather than protectionism and isolationism.
TEC helps to bring the EU and USA closer together, but it will not do to rely on the outcomes of TEC by themselves.
More needs to be done to fold this kind of approach into our day-to-day considerations at this level.
Failure is all too easy to predict based on our political economies - hard work is needed to overcome this fear.
<D>
Mr President, the number of non attached Members may be increased at any time, owing to unforeseen events.
This is in line with the political cohesion of existing political groups and with the possibility of achieving consensus among the non-attached Members, provided there are enough to form a political group.
In terms of legislative policy, the provisions of the Rules of Procedure concerning the composition of the Conference of Presidents should thus not be confined to cases where the number of non-attached Members is small.
The Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament contain provisions of primarily long-term validity.
They should produce useful results, not only at the time of legislation or amendment, but also under changing circumstances in the future.
For this reason, ad hoc situations, which may change at any moment and indeed may change back to the previous status quo, should not result each time in the adoption of new regulations.
This issue touches on parliamentary sovereignty, parliamentary autonomy and Parliament's ability to organise itself, and I would ask you to vote in favour.
<D>
- Mr President, I am one of those people who would like to ensure the continuity of Internet freedom.
The creators of the Internet had great faith in the basic goodness of humankind, and I tend to share that faith.
Unfortunately, very often with the Internet, just as in any human society, we have to face the sad fact that regulations are needed to make sure that those who cannot protect themselves are protected too.
The safety of an individual is a fundamental right, just as much as the right to free speech and to self-expression.
Abominations such as child pornography and paedophilia, as well as Internet fraud, must be stopped.
We cannot tolerate Internet predators of any kind, and while we are discussing this topic of great interest I would like to draw your attention to a much less discussed fact: the Internet is also full of sites that incite hatred, violence and intolerance towards all kinds of minorities, among them ethnic minorities.
It is an aspect of the Internet that needs our attention.
We have to make sure that minorities also feel protected.
It is unacceptable that many extremist groups use the Internet to instigate hatred and xenophobia.
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my Group awaited today's statement by Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner with great interest.
I should like to thank her again and say that the Commission's communication, adopted on 20 May, made very interesting reading.
We applaud President Sarkozy for having started the ball rolling, for having aroused the interest of the European Council and for having prompted a renewal of our Mediterranean policy, which my Group supports and hopes will prove tangible and rapid.
We know how difficult it is to pursue the ambitious goals of the Barcelona Process.
On the one hand there is the unresolved Middle East conflict and tension in the Western Sahara.
There is also the gap that sometimes separates us from the democratic, economic and social models of our partner countries, hampering attainment of the goals we have set ourselves.
All of this is serious and makes matters difficult, but should not constitute a pretext to justify delays or changes of mind.
We believe that President Sarkozy's political initiative and the backing provided by the European Commission go in the right direction, namely that of lending substance and reality to our political aspirations.
To this end the Commission has identified four projects, recalled by our Commissioner this morning, in addition to the activities already planned: motorways of the seas, depollution of the Mediterranean, environmental management, civil protection cooperation to tackle natural disasters and, lastly, a solar energy programme for the Mediterranean.
Each of these projects is important, and rather than dwelling on them now we shall do so once the Commission has provided more details.
These are projects which, if carried out, will act as an incredibly important driving force, both to give the Barcelona Process a new lease of life and to complement measures already under way but not yet completed.
I would recall the free trade area planned for 2010: we should like to know more about this, Commissioner, as well as about the state of play on the objectives set out in the association agreements and other ongoing projects.
To conclude, as concerns tangible projects to be completed within a reasonable time frame, I would also recall that, as well as the infrastructure of the seas and the North-South link, fresh impetus is also needed for a South-South motorway corridor connecting the countries on the southern shore of the Mediterranean; this system must in addition be interconnected with Europe.
Lastly, there needs to be a loan scheme providing help on issues such as water and infrastructure in the Middle East.
Finally, I wish to draw the attention of the Council and the Commission to two issues.
The first concerns the administration and operation of the Euro-Mediterranean Assembly.
The European Union has also made major commitments in the Middle East, and we expect these commitments to be followed up with political action.
Can the Council tell us what real, practical prospects there are of such action?
<D>
The report by Mrs Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou recommends rejecting the Commission's proposal for amending a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the organisation of the working time of persons performing mobile road transport activities.
I voted in favour of this report, which seeks to reject a proposal by the European Commission that will not make it possible to remedy the failings identified in the implementation and monitoring of the rules in relation to driving times and rest periods directly linked to safety and social rights.
Furthermore, there is no clarification as to the scope of this directive and possible ways of monitoring.
In any case, Member States must assume sole responsibility in this area.
Finally, this proposal does not define any better the notion of 'mobile workers' or 'self-employed drivers', and with good reason, since this is where the real challenge of this directive lies.
Should we exclude all self-employed drivers from this directive?
The question remains open, because the problem is complex.
Indeed, there exists a widespread practice of drivers working as 'false' self-employed drivers, when they are in fact employed by companies which, for reasons of profitability, bypass the rules in relation to driving times and rest periods.
<D>
Many thanks to the President of the European Commission.
I would now like to welcome Hans Joachim Opitz, who is also here with us today and is representing all the former Secretaries-General.
We now have the pleasure of listening once again to the European Union Youth Orchestra.
(Short performance by the European Union Youth Orchestra)
(Loud applause)
(The House rose and listened to the European anthem)
(The sitting was suspended at 4.15 p.m. and resumed at 4.20 p.m.)
<D>
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs, as others have done.
However, in my remarks, instead of the three 'L's used by Mr Martinez, which if I remember correctly were 'litany', 'liturgy' and 'lethargy', I would rather use three 'I's, which are 'implementation', 'initiation' and 'imagination'.
Firstly, I should like to thank the rapporteurs, particularly Mr Virrankoski, for including a couple of paragraphs about the monitoring of the budget.
It is extremely important that we think about the question of value for money.
Even if that particular term is not included in the resolution, it is, no doubt, in the hearts of everybody that we need to be able to justify, with our specialised committees, the monies we are actually spending, not just in the current period, but also in the fact of having the national management declarations, which it seems many Member States are still reluctant to put together.
Secondly, I would like to thank both the rapporteurs and the Commissioner, in this regard, for having, in my own budget for the year 2007, implemented those pilot projects and preparatory projects which were included.
There are quite a few of them, and it is nice to have a certain continuity as we go through into 2008, particularly picking up on the pilot information networks, but also on the projects with the EU, China and India.
That brings me to my last point, which is the question of imagination.
Einstein said that imagination is more important than knowledge.
We have seen in this debate that many colleagues - Mr Mantovani, Ms Guy-Quint and others - and myself always deplore the fact that we have too little money in category four, the external actions.
We know perfectly well there is too little, so I would put in a particular plea at this stage, as we look towards the budget review, that maybe we should actually use a little imagination to see how the European Union will be called upon in the future to meet the global challenges of the future and to play its part in global assistance and the functioning of the global economy, and then make sure we have the means to be able to implement what we wish to take on as our policies.

(HU) The time has come for us to have a serious and worthwhile debate on genetic technology in Europe, for up to now we have only heard religious polemics, in many cases only whipping up hysteria.
Science cannot and must not be stopped.
With an explosion in population and food prices, we cannot dismiss the opportunities offered us by biotechnology and genetic engineering.
We cannot have the green revolution without them.
My report on biogas, approved in March, shows that the European Parliament expressed consensus on licensing GM plants to be grown for bio-energy.
While there was consensus among the parliamentary parties in Hungary on the preservation of GM-free agriculture, we have to see that this is an illusion.
Eighty-five per cent of the soya imported as animal feed is now genetically modified.
It is obvious that genetic modification is not a game, the risks are huge.
It is imperative that a credible, science-based specialist supervisory agency at Union level, independent of big business, is set up, able to inspect GM products, able to provide protection against hazards and quell groundless anxieties.
On the one hand, the multinational companies concerned with GMOs are somewhat reluctant to issue detailed documentation about their products, and are not partners in scientific trials although, for consumer protection, this would be an essential requirement.
On the other hand, there is also a lot of confusing information and unscientific scare stories put about by GM opponents.
That is why this debate is so important.
Thank you for your attention.
<D>
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) As the honourable Member knows, the Council does not comment on speeches by Heads of State of European Union Member States.
Naturally, however, I have noted President Sarkozy's opinion, which is that of the Head of State of a very important EU Member State.
If we are to progress in that direction or not, towards a Europe with an enhanced defence, it will be the Council that will have to decide, and as you can imagine, I cannot anticipate the Council's decision.
If that is the Council's decision - and as you know, defence is a specific area that requires very strong consensus - then naturally we will be able to go forward along that route, but the decision is obviously in the Council's hands.
I do not have a crystal ball and therefore cannot tell you how far this idea will go.
We shall see, but since it is a proposal from President Sarkozy, it will obviously be listened to very attentively, like all his proposals.
Subject: Accession negotiations with Macedonia
What is the Council's assessment of the stage reached in bringing Macedonia closer to the EU, and when does it consider that it will be possible or desirable to set a date for starting accession negotiations?
<D>
The South Caucasus is a very interesting area which has been a constant topic of discussion in Europe for two hundred years now.
There has been a conflict of interests in these places between Russia, Iran and Turkey throughout this period.
The rugged contours of the landscape and the rich history provide a hint of the enormous ethnic and religious complexities.
Now the EU has also discovered this region.
It is truly wonderful how Mrs Tagliavini has obtained a perfect knowledge of the entire area, including the historical and present-day contexts, on the basis of the negotiations in Georgia.
In fact, I bow down deeply before her.
It is excellent that the authors of a report on the need to develop a new EU strategy for the South Caucasus have taken notice of an organisation such as the OSCE.
It is a pity that they apparently failed to spot the relationships between the states in the area and Iran, and also the specific intentions of Turkey in the region.
The authors have clearly forgotten the 'glorious' declaration of the independent state of Kosovo, and their unconcealed attacks on Russia and repudiation of local elections in Abkhazia and South Ossetia include the formulation 'de facto organs of the occupied territories'.
This strongly reminds me of the findings of the mission of a certain Lord Runciman in the pre-war Czechoslovak Republic.
Despite this, I believe it will be possible in the near future for the Members concerned to improve their knowledge of this part of Europe and for the next session to be more balanced.
For the aforementioned reasons, the GUE/NGL Group will abstain from the final vote on the resolution.
<D>
Mr President, when the regulation on security features and the inclusion of biometric details in European passports was adopted in 2004, the Member States did not envisage any derogation from the obligation to provide fingerprints.
Current experience shows that the existing technology still does not ensure that the fingerprints of children under the age of 12 are reliable enough to allow them to be used as a security feature in passports.
I therefore welcome the compromise found with the Member States to set 12 as the age limit for the collection of biometric data, and which includes a clause for revision in three years.
On our side, we have accepted this derogation for those Member States that have already adopted legislation for children over the age of six.
The use of this type of data would only be acceptable if it truly offered protection to our children.
That is not yet the case.
We remain, however, open to any positive changes in the technology in this field.
Our priority is to ensure the safety of children travelling alone to avoid kidnapping and trafficking of children.
The inclusion of this data in passports gives a false sense of security as it does not prevent a child from crossing a border without parental consent.
The compromise found with the Member States will allow the Commission to present a report on the requirements for minors travelling alone across external borders.
This report will thus allow initiatives to be proposed that will guarantee a European approach to the rules protecting minors when they cross external borders of the Member States.
Finally, the biometric data in passports must only be used to verify the authenticity of the document and the use of sensitive personal data such as biometric details is only acceptable in conjunction with strict data protection rules.
<D>
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FR) Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the European Council would be well-advised to refrain from displaying any sort of arrogance towards the people of Ireland, who merely exercised a democratic right recognised by their Constitution.
Rather than calling for the continuation of the ratification process in an attempt to isolate this new black sheep, it would be better to knuckle down to a clear analysis of the situation.
The Irish 'no' vote was particularly strong among the working classes and I would remind you that turnout was much higher than in the past; according to my Group, this reveals that the crisis surrounding the legitimacy of the current European model is growing ever deeper.
This crisis was already at the heart of the French and Dutch 'no' votes; it is expressed differently elsewhere but it is always an underlying element.
Remember the large-scale protests against the Bolkestein Directive; think of the debate that arose after the Laval and Viking affairs, particularly in Scandinavian countries, or in Germany after the Rüffert judgment.
In this respect, I want to say to my friend Martin Schulz that I agree completely with what he said about Mr McCreevy.
The problem is that those decisions - the ones I have just mentioned - were taken not by Mr McCreevy but by the Court of Justice on the basis of specific articles (Articles 43 and 49 of the current Treaties incorporated in the Lisbon Treaty).
Think, too, of the political impact of the powerful strike in Dacia, Romania against 'low-cost Europe'.
Look at the anger of farmers or small-scale fishermen who are in dire straits.
What lies at the root of all these situations is first and foremost the current European economic and social model: instead of providing security, it leads to greater insecurity.
That is the number one problem.
Another factor is the way in which the Union functions.
Decisions are taken far from the people and without the people.
We are content with explaining them to them rather then consulting them.
The deliberate decision to present the Lisbon Treaty in a form that is totally illegible to a lay person is, in this respect, a spectacular illustration of what I would call 'the ivory tower syndrome'.
This has devastating effects on our citizens, especially the less populated nations, which feel as though they are being bandied about to satisfy the interests of the more powerful nations.
Finally, there are more and more questions in many countries, including Ireland, about the role Europe plays in the world, where it is expected to ensure that there is a much stronger emphasis on the force of politics rather than the politics of force.
Running away from these debates means exacerbating the crisis in Europe; conducting them in complete transparency would be a first step on the road to finding a solution.
<D>
in writing. - (PT) The sustainability of fish stocks is fundamental to guaranteeing the long-term existence of fishing activity and the socioeconomic viability of the fishing sector.
Illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing threatens this sustainability and calls into question the viability of the sector and fishing communities dependent on it.
As such, it is vital that measures are adopted to reinforce the fight against these illegal activities, in particular by reinforcing control mechanisms in each Member State.
This proposal, which complements measures already laid down within the common fisheries policy, introduces various provisions which aim to curb these practices carried out by vessels flying the flag of a Member State or by vessels from third countries.
The measures proposed therefore include greater control by the Member States at their ports, the requirement for a certificate issued by the flag State indicating that the catch is legal and the creation of a list of vessels involved in IUU fishing.
However, we would reiterate that any future harmonisation of these proposals with a future revision of the Community legislation on control must safeguard the competences of the Member States, particularly for inspections.
We would also reiterate that all the issues relating to penalties come under the competence of each Member State.
<D>
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I would like to speak first and mainly about Croatia.
Croatia has made progress in a number of areas.
I am very grateful for the efforts which have been made in Croatia itself, in particular, with regard to judicial reform.
A number of steps were needed and, as a result of the appointment of two new ministers, some things have been put in motion.
I know that ministers cannot do everything, but significant progress has been made on combating corruption and cross-border crime.
Secondly, as far as the question of cooperation with the International Criminal Court is concerned, I would like to state clearly that I expect Croatia to take all the necessary steps in this respect.
There have been disputes about different chains of command and the corresponding documents.
I hope that these issues will be resolved in the near future so that they do not cause interruptions or delays in the negotiations.
Thirdly, Croatia has also made some moves towards economic reform.
I am very pleased about the plans in this area, particularly relating to the shipping industry.
It has not been easy, but the important foundations have been laid.
I am also happy that agreements could be reached with workers in the shipping industry.
These reforms will be painful, but they are necessary and they can be made in a sensible form.
I come now to the main question, which is always controversial, concerning border disputes.
Commissioner, unfortunately I must tell you that I am rather disappointed that you have addressed this issue without making contact with Parliament.
I have sent you the documents and you have failed to respond.
We would probably have made more progress if you had handled these issues with more sensitivity.
In order to ensure that no misunderstandings arise, I fully support your proposal for mediation.
However, we could have moved further forward if a clear statement had been made in advance on the question of the importance of international law rather than afterwards.
We are in a difficult situation.
It is clear that movement is needed on both sides.
The wording of your original proposal was not ideal.
I would have preferred you to be in closer contact with Parliament and with the rapporteur.
This would perhaps have allowed us to achieve more by working together.
Unfortunately that was not the case, but that is not what lies at the heart of this debate.
The key issue of the debate is how we can make progress.
We will make progress.
This is likely to be the wording which I will propose to Parliament tomorrow.
We will say that the mediation that you have proposed - that is how it is and I fully support it - should be based on international law, including the principles of equity.
The two sides must agree to move in this direction.
Both Croatia and Slovenia must recognise that international law is necessary but, of course, also that the principles of equity, fairness and a just solution - a political solution, if you want to describe it in that way - are essential.
Both sides must acknowledge this and it is actually rather sad that we are in a situation where we cannot progress.
Given the other problems which there are in the world and, in particular, in Europe, it should be possible to solve these problems by mutual agreement.
Despite all the criticism, I do, of course, wish you every success in your efforts to convince both sides.
Unfortunately, yesterday's discussion was not as positive as it should have been, but I hope that will soon change.
I would like to make one more general remark which also applies to Macedonia.
There are bilateral problems, but they should not be allowed to block the negotiations on enlargement.
As regards our amendment, which is often misunderstood, it is, of course, the case that bilateral problems should not form part of the negotiation framework.
They must remain outside the framework.
This is all about the negotiations between the European Union and the individual countries.
The bilateral problems must be resolved in parallel, if both sides - in this case Macedonia and Greece - are prepared to consider the issues.
This Parliament must give a clear signal that both sides in all these disputes must be prepared to move.
It is not possible for one side to compromise and the other to remain in the same position.
We must make it clear in all these cases that the bilateral problems must not be allowed to block the accession negotiations.
They can be resolved in parallel with the negotiations and this Parliament will help to ensure that both sides make a move in the two disputes which we are discussing here.
I hope that we will then achieve positive results.
<D>
(RO) The Council of Europe is the institution which deals with respect for human rights.
The rights and protection of minorities come under the remit of Member States, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity.
Traditional and ethnic minorities, migrant minorities and immigrants must comply with the national legislation of the Member State where they reside.
I believe that the integration of new migrant minorities should not be part of the common policy on immigration which the EU is currently drafting.
This policy can be defined only when the current barriers to the free movement of workers from the Member States which joined the European Union after 2004 disappear within the EU.
The protection of migrant minorities is part of the principles promoted by social Europe.
Providing fair working conditions for all European citizens, no matter what their Member State of origin is, guarantees them a decent living.
As a European socialist, I support the development of a European framework for legal immigration, but I actively advocate, first and foremost, observance of the European Union's basic principles for all European citizens.
<D>
First of all, I would like to express my thanks for the excellent spirit of cooperation that we all experienced during our work on this very important matter.
Baroness Ashton certainly does not have an easy task ahead of her now that our common European External Action Service is to be established.
However, together with the Council and the Commission, Parliament has laid the foundation for an effective representative organisation that will truly be able to represent Europe and European values and interests around the world.
The EU's strength is diversity.
The European Union is made up of people with different backgrounds, skills and experience.
By creating an External Action Service that utilises men and women recruited from all of our Member States, we are also utilising Europe's greatest strength and resource.
At the same time, there must be absolutely no doubt that it is skills and qualifications that are decisive when it comes to making appointments to posts within the new External Action Service.
The European Parliament has a fine motto: united in diversity.
These are words that carry obligations and they have a deep meaning.
I hope that, under Baroness Ashton, the External Action Service will develop into a genuine European service that will represent citizens from all of our Member States, women as well as men.
Those who are to work in our common External Action Service must be clearly trained to represent the whole of the Union.
I wholeheartedly wish Baroness Ashton success in this important work.
<D>
(ES) Madam President, I would like to refer to three aspects of this magnificent report.
Firstly, the role of Parliament in the democratic scrutiny of strategic documents relating to financial instruments on external assistance.
In the last plenary sitting we once again discussed and criticised the failure by the Commission to fulfil its commitment on transparency and parliamentary scrutiny in the context of the financing instrument for development cooperation.
I hope that this is not going to be repeated in this area.
Secondly, I would like the Commission to be asked to inform Parliament as soon as possible as to when and how it proposes to put in place the post-electoral protocol mechanism in the framework of Election Observation Missions, proposed by this report.
Thirdly and finally, the report calls on the Council and the Commission to analyse, support and coordinate the setting of benchmarks for EU dialogues with actions of other donors and international organisations, especially the UN mechanisms in place.
Tomorrow an urgent resolution will be debated in this House on the financing of the special court to judge war crimes in Sierra Leone, set up by the United Nations.
I consider this to be an example of the lack of coordination that currently exists between the EU and international organisations and a good example of the work that is still to be done.
I therefore hope that this report will be a step forward towards achieving this coordination.
<D>
(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to take a few moments to express my support, our support, for Commissioner Frattini and to say emphatically to him that the attacks made on him in connection with the issue of Romanies in Italy are absolutely intolerable.
We all know the values that the Commissioner is defending, the values associated with the defence of human rights, the values that are those of the European Union, and on these values, Commissioner, you are irreproachable.
To return to Euromed, I welcome the convening of the Euro-Mediterranean Ministerial Conference on migration, which is to be held in the Algarve, for it will be the first of its kind, the first to be uniquely devoted to the question of migratory movements in the Euro-Mediterranean area.
The subject of migratory movements is a key issue that must be placed at the centre of our dialogue, our partnership and our cooperation with the countries of the Euro-Mediterranean region, continuing on from the conferences of Rabat and Tripoli.
This is an area in which the Member States cannot act alone.
We need support and cooperation from our partner nations, which are themselves often source countries or transit countries, if our migration policy is to be made more effective.
We need to work with them to reach a consensus on the returns policy, to increase the number of agreements on readmission and together to implement a policy of intelligent codevelopment so that nationals from these countries are able to remain in their homeland and contribute towards its growth.
The question of migratory movements has a security dimension, but it also has a human dimension that should not be ignored.
This is why I would like to see respect for fundamental human rights made one of the themes of the conference.
I hope that this meeting will provide an opportunity for open and realistic exchanges, so that together we can find the most appropriate solutions for everyone concerned.
<D>
author. - Mr President, in short, I am disappointed with the Commission's response to our oral question.
I appreciate that a world agreement would be ideal and I appreciate that we need to involve the IMO, but the IMO has got to be one of the slowest international organisations the world has ever come across.
It works at the pace of a tortoise, and we want action now.
Commissioner, if I drop 2 000 heavy metal boxes into the sea, deliberately, with a load of materials in, then I would be prosecuted.
Yet we allow this to happen every year in EU waters.
I make a plea: you cannot play Pontius Pilot with this and wash your hands of the problem.
It is a problem that is increasing.
It is a serious problem and it is a problem that you have to address.
It is not a problem you can hide behind, saying 'well, we need to assess this' and 'we need to assess that', or whatever.
You have heard what the Members have said.
Please now get on with trying to sort it out.
<D>
As we have all observed, because it has been the main topic of news, since early April, Thailand has experienced an atmosphere of political violence that it had not seen in the last decade.
I would first of all like to express my solidarity with the families of the victims of the violence on the streets.
I think that we have here what I would describe as a conventional confrontation between the freedom of expression and association, on the one hand, and the need for the government to maintain public order, on the other.
The train of events has passed very quickly over recent days and hours.
Relative calm seems to have returned to Bangkok, although the capital was ablaze last night following intervention by government forces.
Let us hope that a new spiral of violence can be avoided.
However, to ensure this happens, we need moderation because democracy cannot prevail through violence.
I think that the government will have to implement the roadmap which it presented on 3 May.
I also believe that investigation of the recent events and punishment of the guilty are measures required to ensure reconciliation.
<D>
Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteur for their constructive cooperation.
I think we have achieved a very good result.
Last autumn, the World Wide Fund for Nature published a report revealing that, if we continue to use the Earth's resources as we are doing right now, by the mid 2030s we will need two planets.
The simple fact of the matter is that we use too much on our planet.
We use resources quicker than they are able to replenish themselves.
This has to change if we want to prevent an environmental crisis.
The way that we use the resources has to change, and it is not only the politicians who have a responsibility here; producers and consumers do, too.
The Ecolabel that is currently being revised is a tool intended to encourage the production and sale of goods produced in a sustainable manner.
One of the weaknesses of the label is that consumers are not very aware of it - and in this regard I agree with Mr Wijkman - and therefore it is not particularly attractive to producers either.
If producers cannot use the label to market a good product, why would they then attempt to produce the most sustainable product within a particular product group?
This is also one of the problems we have tried to rectify with our new ideas.
There is now a clear requirement for Member States and the Commission to produce an action plan to promote awareness of the Ecolabel through various campaigns.
We have had a long discussion about foodstuffs and I think that we have arrived at a sensible solution.
The Commission's proposal to consider only processed foods and only transport, packaging and processing is not the end of the matter.
Instead, we have asked for a detailed examination of how we can best include foodstuffs in the ecolabelling scheme so as to ensure that we have done everything correctly from the outset and do not cause confusion with other forms of ecological labelling.
Finally, I would like to point out that the label now also benefits goods produced to last a long time and goods that can be re-used.
In other words, we need to change the way we produce and consume goods if we want our economies to be sustainable.
It requires us to look at the whole of a product's lifecycle, so that we can improve the way raw materials are treated during the production of a product and, in particular, the way we dispose of a product after use.
I hope that the tool that we have improved here will be a good one for promoting a more sustainable planet.
<D>
We agree with various aspects highlighted by the report, in particular:
the fact that the policy shift has resulted in a loss of potential market opportunities for EU producers and has led to increased reliance on imported food from outside the European Union, produced to very different production standards, thereby placing EU agricultural products at a disadvantage;
the concern that dramatic increases in agricultural production costs may result in less usage and reduced output, which will exacerbate the food crisis in Europe and the world;
the need for policy instruments aimed at averting such large and damaging price fluctuations;
the concern about increasing market concentration in the food retail sector, which has led to the development of monopolies, and the need for alternative solutions in negotiations with retailers, in favour of small farmers.
However, there are also aspects with which we cannot agree:
the increased orientation of the common agricultural policy towards the market and the devaluation of food sovereignty, with the emphasis solely being placed on food security, forgetting that this is difficult without food sovereignty.
That is why we abstained.
<D>
in writing. - (FR) It is a highly controversial directive, 'on ice' for almost six years, that the European Parliament passed today.
Yet, it is a text very close to the hearts of Europeans because it provides for the harmonisation of the consumer credit market.
This market is worth 800 billion euros (two out of three Europeans use credit to buy furniture, a television or a car), and interest rates currently vary from 6% (in Finland) to more than 12% (in Portugal), and yet transactions have so far been mainly national; less than 1% of credits are currently cross-border.
The directive opens up European borders to consumers looking for the best credit deals: they can choose the best offer and be guaranteed the same rights and the same standards of information, comparison and, above all, protection against getting into too much debt.
Assessing the creditworthiness of the borrower, free and fast information in the event of refusal and the 14-days right of withdrawal in principle are some of the main objectives of the directive.
However, one regret, and it is a big one, is the lack of clarity surrounding early repayment terms.
Heavily penalising consumers who repay early would make the other advantages of harmonisation completely pointless!
<D>
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I would like to start by underlining that my group has a strong interest in good partnership-based relations with India, a country which is regarded as the world's largest democracy.
However - and this also needs to be emphasised - equal partnership means addressing problems honestly.
That is still not happening with India, and nor is it evident in the resolution before us.
That is why we are unfortunately unable to support this compromise.
How can we claim that India provides a model for handling cultural and religious pluralism, as stated in the resolution, when yet again, there have been countless deaths in the violent excesses perpetrated by extremist Hindus against Christians in Orissa and Muslims in Kashmir?
Those responsible for the pogroms in Gujarat have still not been brought to justice.
Around 200 cases are still caught up in India's sluggish judicial system.
Is resolute action genuinely being taken to deal with the radical factions' excesses and the massacres of Christians and Muslims?
How much equality do the Dalits really enjoy?
Is there genuine universality of human rights?
Are children being protected from labour and exploitation at last?
These are questions which we should be discussing frankly with our Indian partners.
In the last five years, the Indian National Human Rights Commission has recorded more than 14 000 deaths in police and military custody.
I appeal to India to reform the Armed Forces Special Powers Act.
It is this arbitrary justice which is fuelling the rebel movements in many Indian states.
Poverty in India is still a cause for serious concern, and even good-quality programmes are not enough.
Much more needs to be done, given that 40% of the world's most undernourished children live in India.
With knowledge and technology transfer, Europe can make a very substantial contribution to genuinely sustainable development in India.
<D>
(NL) Mr President, when Venezuela voted recently in a referendum, rejecting Chavez's plans for a radical change to the constitution by a very narrow majority, the would-be dictator of Venezuela bowed to the will of the people, as leaders ought to in a more or less free country.
I think that we in Europe might learn a lot from his example.
We are seeing a 'European Constitution', democratically rejected in two Member States by a large majority of the electorate, dished up to us afresh.
Virtually unaltered, apart from a few cosmetic changes.
There is no room for any more real debate and certainly not for a referendum in countries likely to be critical of it or to vote no.
The European Constitution - sorry, the Reform Treaty - is being signed in Lisbon amid much pomp and ceremony and will then be rushed through the parliaments that support it with indecent haste.
Europe is a sham democracy.
And the way in which the Eurocrats treat the voice of the people was again apparent very recently in what Commissioner Rehn told us about the possibility of Turkish accession.
He is on record as saying that national agreements or specific election pledges must not stand in the way of Turkish accession.
The European mandarins don't give two hoots about the election promises made to voters about Turkey's accession.
In Venezuela there is still democracy for the time being, but sadly a lot less of it in Europe.
<D>
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, the Horn of Africa is a dreadful region where internal and regional conflicts continue to undermine peace and security.
They create humanitarian disasters and paralyse the development of this strategically significant region.
Each war, each conflict accentuates the fragility of the states.
At the heart of most of these conflicts is the lack of leadership and democratic governments rightly put forward in the report of the EP delegation.
What this region needs is home-grown democratisation, respect for national and international rule of law and above all national reconciliation.
About Somalia, I would like to emphasise that the resignation of former president Yusuf and the withdrawal of Ethiopian forces creates a huge window of opportunity.
The time has come to pick up the pieces and bring about intra-Somali peace.
The Somali Parliament is a crucial factor for confidence-building and can make the peace process all-inclusive.
Furthermore, it is imperative that the EU supports the renewal and strengthening of an African Union Peace Force.
This force needs a decent UN mandate.
If not, Ugandan and Burundian forces will pull away from Mogadishu leaving a security gap behind.
I entirely agree with Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner.
There is a momentum for change now in Somalia that should be taken advantage of.
The power as well as the security vacuum must be filled.
If not, the stateless chaos known as Somalia will remain.
<D>
Mr Siekierski's report on the distribution of food to the most deprived persons raises issues covered in Council regulations which refer to financing of the common agricultural policy and to specific provisions in that material.
We have here a situation which proves that there are also large areas of poverty and want inside the European Union.
Those affected are most often people living in villages and small towns, and this includes many children.
According to official statistics around 80 million Europeans live below the poverty line.
It is to be feared that the present crisis and rising unemployment will increase that alarming number.
The fact that the amount allocated to the programme of food aid for the poorest inhabitants of the EU will rise from EUR 305 million to EUR 500 million is in itself a positive sign.
However, I think that it is necessary to make changes to the systems in Member States in order to eliminate or at least significantly limit this shameful situation.
The main cause of this deprivation is unemployment and excessively high food prices (let us only compare the remuneration received by farmers for their products with the retail price in the shops).
Our system of social care is also far from perfect.
Finally I would like to emphasise very clearly that it is essential that the food used for the purposes of the aid programme should be of good quality, and should ideally be fresh and come from local farms.
<D>
(NL) Madam President, Commissioner, I am filled with sadness.
At Mrs Gräßle's proposal, OLAF is unwittingly being accorded additional powers, while OLAF itself is not subject to adequate supervision.
In 1999, the then Committee of Wise Men predicted that, as an internal Commission office, OLAF would refuse to work with a powerless supervisory committee.
The effects are clear for everyone to see.
Unhindered by accountability and control, OLAF's management, and particularly its Director-General, has slipped up time and again.
Staged staff selection, violation of the rights of the defence, concealment of evidence and submission of criminal dossiers with lapsed prosecution deadlines.
The pièce de résistance is OLAF's own dreamed up charge of bribery against a journalist who was too well informed for OLAF's liking.
In fact, OLAF even managed to secure a house search, at which point the journalist's belongings were confiscated.
OLAF subsequently lied about the full facts to the Commission, Parliament, the law courts, the ombudsman and the public prosecutors in Belgium and Germany for years.
In fact, OLAF has sent its own researchers out with false information.
How far can they take this?
The Commission is aware of this, and says this has to stop, but claims it is not authorised to act.
This is precisely why the Commission has withdrawn this proposal.
As you already indicated, it was made with the best of intentions.
Our increasing insight into current abuses, though, make it necessary for a different supervisory body to monitor OLAF, and one of the options indicated by yourself is coming to an end.
The solution is an independent OLAF which operates independently of the Commission and under competent supervision, that is not appointed by politicians but by public prosecutors of the Member States, until such time as a European public prosecution is formed.
<D>
Ladies and gentlemen, the joint programme for growth and jobs, also known as the Lisbon strategy, came into being in 2005.
It is now 2009 and, despite everything, we are faced with increasing poverty and an economic and financial crisis without parallel in history.
Furthermore, the latest forecasts predict that the number of people unemployed in the EU will rise by almost 3.5 million in 2009.
Despite all of the measures adopted to date, unemployment is rising.
I am not the only one who thinks that something is wrong.
The current situation shows the failure of the policies to date which have mainly supported the accumulation of large profits by large commercial and financial groupings, the creation of huge monopolies and a deterioration in the living standards of workers and ordinary people.
Europe must take a different route.
At its spring meeting, the Council should adopt a European strategy for solidarity and sustainable development and a new set of economic, social and environmental policies for supporting investment especially in the quality of work, improving qualifications, infrastructure support programmes, policies of cohesion, environmental protection and improved health and safety protection at work.
A major problem confronting Member States, including the Czech Republic, is company relocations.
The EU should set up a regulatory framework which would penalise firms for relocating, for example, by making EU financial support conditional on the fulfilment of obligations involving job protection and local development.
Especially now, at a time of financial and economic crisis, we need not only solidarity but also strict and fast-operating rules and instruments as a common defence against the crisis.
In this way, we would also be making a dignified link to the inheritance of Jean Monet, whom we are commemorating today.
<D>
Madam President, I have here a letter, written by 28 women from Darfur who managed to escape from the conflict zone, which is addressed to the African Union and the League of Arab States.
The women of Darfur, in the letter dated 4 March 2009, express their support for the warrant issued by the International Criminal Court for the arrest of the Sudanese leader Omar al-Bashir.
For the first time in the seven years that the Court has been in operation, a warrant has been issued for a sitting head of state.
In their letter, the women of Darfur describe the horrifying scenes of violence and rape which are part of daily life in the province, where rape is intentionally used as a weapon, in order to cause women suffering and to stigmatise them, as well as to destroy unity and demoralise the whole of society.
Omar al-Bashir responded to the international arrest warrant by expelling 13 foreign charitable organisations from Sudan.
This means that, in the coming weeks, over a million people living in refugee camps in Sudan will have no access to basic aid, such as clean water, food or medical care.
The shortage of clean water, which will begin to be felt in the coming days, will promote the spread of communicable diseases, especially in western Darfur.
Witnesses have reported cases of diarrhoea in the Zam-Zam camp and cases of meningitis in the Kalma camp.
The first, and the main, victims of the decision taken by the Sudanese Government will be the children.
Omar al-Bashir's decision to expel charitable organisations from Darfur will result in further crimes.
The European Parliament resolution calls on the UN and the International Criminal Court to investigate whether the Sudanese President's latest decision constitutes a war crime under international law.
Omar al-Bashir's Government does not guarantee Sudanese citizens the right to protection, and must be held to account by the international community for violating this right.
<D>
(IT) Mr President, Mr Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament's Committee on Transport and Tourism could not, and cannot, avoid the task of providing a holistic response to the need to improve shipping safety and also to lay down the measures to be taken in the event of accidents.
The third maritime package also deals effectively with issues of the liability of carriers in relation to their passengers and the goods they carry.
It was about time, always assuming that the matter is not disregarded, as I have the impression is happening in the case of airline passengers' rights.
I actually believe that the goals for category A ships to come into line by 2016 and the even later deadline set for category B, C and D ships are too lenient and give the carriers too much leeway.
I hope that this largesse by the European Union is repaid by the carriers' prompt compliance with the new regulations.
We needed, and still need, common standards for classification companies which are responsible for monitoring ships and granting shipping permits, and also very clear rules governing inspections and the addition of ships to the blacklist.
I therefore welcome the proposals and also the measures for managing accidents and shipping and environmental disaster risks and the relevant responsibilities, which I call on the Commission to make a greater commitment to uphold.
The far-ranging package also considers measures on investigations, on competences and on just sovereignty in the event of maritime accidents, a compendium which, I hope, will help clarify issues of liability and compensation.
I therefore voted for the set of reports.
<D>
SOLVIT was created in order to resolve the problems faced by citizens and businesses as a result of the poor application of legislation on the internal market.
All the Member States, as well as Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, have established a national SOLVIT centre.
They cooperate directly in order to devise rapid and pragmatic solutions to the problems submitted by citizens and businesses.
The centres need sound legal advice on the legal merits of the problems submitted and the solutions proposed.
They have access to legal advice both within their centre and within the competent administration.
Where there are differences of legal opinion on cases being handled jointly, complex legal issues or simply no proper access to legal advice in their country, SOLVIT centres often turn to the Commission for advice.
Member States should ensure that the centres have proper access to legal expertise within their administration.
The Commission should speed up the provision of informal legal assessments to the centres on request.
I welcome the Member States' commitment to monitoring European legislation and its application.
It is not good enough that the European colegislators should implement laws that create more problems than they solve.
<D>
Mr President, I hope that nobody in the EU leadership was happy in Khanty-Mansiysk when the new Russian President was mocking European solidarity.
Now we have the present challenge: are the legitimate existential concerns of smaller littoral states respected or neglected?
If those 'limitrophe' tribes are not respected and their destiny remains marginal, we are all drawn into a swamp of neo-colonialism inside the new Europe.
If Parliament votes against a truly independent environmental impact assessment and dislikes the prevention of real dangers because big money says bluntly 'there is no risk of a disaster' after such positions are proposed as a matter of urgency by one national team, the EU itself as a European idea risks being dumped to a poisoned bottom.
Colleagues who are listening, go to the tombs of Adenauer, Schuman and De Gasperi and ask how you should vote, especially on the first five Gazprom amendments.
As for me, I will shake hands with every esteemed German parliamentarian in this House who votes against these amendments by 41 Members.
Those who were misguided may remedy the mistake by abstaining.
Let Europe remain our priority.
(Applause)
<D>
in writing. - (PL) The proposal to mobilise the Solidarity Fund once again is contained in amending budget No 3/2008.
The previous application benefiting the United Kingdom (EUR 162 million) together with the application currently under consideration to benefit Greece and Slovenia (totalling EUR 98 million) leaves considerable scope for manoeuvre in the second half of 2008, bearing in mind that the annual ceiling for Solidarity Fund resources is approximately EUR 1 billion.
Furthermore, other formal requirements contained in the interinstitutional agreement of 17 May 2006 have been met.
The Committee on Budgets was able to obtain all necessary additional clarification at the meeting in May attended by representatives of the countries that suffered natural disasters in 2007.
The countries concerned were Greece, which was affected by forest fires, and Slovenia, which was affected by floods.
As is customary in such cases, the only concerns relate to the time it takes for the Union's institutions to react.
This issue has been raised ad nauseam.
The applications by Greece and Slovenia were received in October and November of 2007.
The amending budget was submitted by the European Commission on 14 April 2008.
Although this does indeed indicate that the process was swifter than in the past, the pace remains unsatisfactory.
There is therefore all the more reason to highlight the swift response by the European Parliament, and the good cooperation between the Committee on Regional Development and the Committee on Budgets, regarding favourable consideration of the proposal concerning aid for the affected countries.
<D>
- (LT) The discussion on the common energy policy and energy security started in 2006 in the wake of the Russian-Ukrainian gas crisis, the consequences of which had an unfavourable impact on Europe.
Regrettably, we still have neither a clearly defined common energy policy, nor an external energy policy.
I hope the European Council will hold a thorough discussion on the issues of EU energy security, including that of Lithuania, in view of the plans to close the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant in 2009.
With the closure of this power plant, Lithuania would become fully dependent on the only source - gas imported from Russia.
The rise in oil and gas prices will result in the electricity price in Lithuania more than doubling.
Consequently, it will be disastrous for the country's households and general economy.
Furthermore, Russia is prone to manipulating energy supplies to pursue its political ambitions.
Lithuania has already experienced this.
On the basis of Article 37 and Protocol No 4 of the Treaty of Accession, I urge the Commission to help find a solution; one possibility would be to postpone the closure of the safe Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant.
<D>
author. - (ES) Mr President, we have a new episode today in this tragic serial set in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
In this case the scene is North Kivu, but the plot and the victims are the same, as covered by an emergency resolution in the January part-session.
Almost five and a half million people have died in the war since 1998, and forty-five thousand more die every month, directly or indirectly due to the war.
The upshot of this is that one thousand five hundred people die every day: in other words, since we started this part-session on Monday, six thousand people have died already in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
The last few months, moreover, particularly in the east of the country, have seen an increase in massacres, rape of little girls and women, and forced recruitment of girls and boys.
Both Laurent Nkunda's rebel troops and the soldiers fighting in the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda are responsible for all this.
We also ought to remember that the MONUC mandate is based on Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, giving it the authority to use all necessary means to dissuade any attempt to use force that jeopardises the life or integrity of civilians or constitutes a threat to the political process.
To date, however, the MONUC presence has proved totally insufficient to bring an end to these barbaric acts.
We must therefore again appeal to the Security Council to react and provide all available means to curtail these massacres.
Moreover, although we must welcome the Goma Conference paving the way towards political negotiation, its agreements, especially agreements concerning demobilisation, remain ambiguous, and their application is unclear.
Lastly, this is another chance, as Mr Posselt has already said, to again call for control mechanisms to be activated and implemented such as the Kimberley Process for diamonds producing certificates of origin for natural resources imported by the EU.
<D>
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Mr President, for 10 years Europe's leaders have taken part in the Olympic Games of Indifference: running the fastest after contracts, jumping as high as possible over human rights and flying as fast as possible over the oppression in Tibet.
That has been going on for 10 years!
Olympic Games in a dictatorship are a political act, whether we like it or not, whether the law likes it or not.
What do we do in this situation?
When the Olympics were held in Germany in 1936, that was a political act that we all regret.
What do we do in this situation?
Firstly, the European Union and all its leaders must in this situation refuse to attend the opening of the Olympic Games.
That is a political sign, a political act that we must support.
(Applause)
Secondly, these Olympic Games are going to take place.
Forty years ago, African Americans gave the clenched-fist salute and if today an African American is perhaps going to become the President of the United States it is partly thanks to these actions at the Olympic Games.
That has to be recognised.
(Applause)
I therefore say 'yes' to civic sportsmen and sportswomen: they should be allowed to say what they want at the Olympic Games.
I say 'yes' to civic journalists: they should watch the athletes jumping, running, swimming, but also, with white, red, black and any other banners, they should make Tiananmen Square a place of freedom, where people can say what they choose.
Thirdly, the spectators must be civic spectators: they must go to the Olympic Games to watch their countries' athletes running, jumping and swimming, but at the same time without wanting to see gold medals hanging round their necks and blood on their shoes.
That is the reality of Beijing today!
Today it is Tibet's turn and not just human rights activists, but also environmental activists.
Tomorrow or the day after there will be the ruling on Hu Jia, and who knows what sentence he will receive.
Why?
Because he was a human rights activist and an environmental activist.
Because order reigns in Beijing.
There are hundreds and hundreds of arrests there.
As Greens, what we want is for everyone who goes to Beijing - I am saying this as it was said 40 years ago - to create havoc there, to speak, to say 'yes' to the Olympics but also 'yes' to freedom, and to say that the Chinese must understand or they will regret ever wanting to host the Olympics.
If order reigns in Beijing, if everyone stays silent, if the whole world acts like the International Olympic Committees, that will be a victory for the dictatorship in Beijing and in Tibet.
If the people speak, if we allow uncensored access to the Internet, I can tell you that it will be a great moment for the Olympic Games, for sport and for democracy, because sport and democracy must go hand in hand; otherwise, there is no point jumping, running or swimming.
(Applause)
<D>
I remember the sense of hope that came with the Orange Revolution, and the break with the Soviet-influenced past that it brought about for the Ukrainian people.
I remember the promises of success, progress, democracy and cooperation that were made at that time to the Ukrainians, both within the country and from abroad.
At the time, the European Union seemed the likely destination for a people who were clearly turning towards the West.
Now that the euphoria is gone, today it seems clear that the protagonists of the Orange Revolution were not up to the challenge.
The disillusionment of the people with the way in which the country is being run is also plain to see.
The election of the candidate beaten by Mr Yushchenko in December 2004 shows either a major split within the country, or a shift in popular feeling, with people now more favourable to the Russian influence.
I believe it is important that the European Union should maintain its ability to be seen as attractive to the Ukraine, and that it should use the various means at its disposal to do so.
I hope that the Ukraine will persist and persevere with internal democratisation, and that, in terms of its past and its history, it will move towards convergence with the EU, a process that will end in its accession as a full member of the EU.
<D>
(DA) Madam President, I want to say that I find this matter unreasonable, and when I speak now it is solely on behalf of Greenland, which is part of the Kingdom of Denmark.
There are a few tiny, remote settlements in the far north with a population of just 10-20 people who live from hunting seals.
If we take away their livelihood, they will have no chance of economic survival.
Neither can we find them alternative employment.
It is hundreds of kilometres to the next settlement, and we should be grateful that they are there, because it enables us to maintain Greenland as part of the Kingdom of Denmark.
The Greenlanders shoot the seals.
Who has anything against that?
No one!
If they are unable to shoot enough seals, then there will be no fish for them to catch.
Consequently, what is being done here is a disaster for Greenland.
This matter has not been discussed thoroughly enough and no account has been taken of the poor people whose livelihood this will take away without offering them anything else in its place.
Treating poor people like this is beneath us.
<D>
(NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in my view the biggest challenge facing the European Union at the moment is the total lack of democratic participation in the decision making process.
The European institutions are increasingly distrusted - quite rightly in my opinion, as it happens - by our citizens who do not accept that many very important decisions which directly affect their lives are made in ivory towers which are no longer monitored by any means or person.
No democratic basis, moreover, exists for these decisions.
I will give two examples.
First example: the text of the new European treaties will soon be signed in Lisbon.
Everyone knows that it is a barely-altered version of the European Constitution.
Mr Zapatero himself has said of it that not one substantial component has been changed.
Well now, that text was voted down by democratic referendum in France and in the Netherlands, but that has all been laughed off now.
The best-case scenario, as it happens, is that we may perhaps get another vote from time to time to keep the Eurocrats happy, but actual democratic statements made by means of referendum are being thrown out with the trash.
In this way, I fear that Europe is increasingly heading towards becoming a small club of the type which, if it governs a super-state, will tolerate no participation and consequently can no longer really be called a democracy.
The same applies, as a matter of fact, to the way in which the possible accession of Turkey to the European Union is being handled.
Our citizens do not want it, quite the reverse, as Turkey is not a European country - not culturally, not geographically, not religiously, not in any way at all - but, nevertheless, the Commission and the Council are taking no account of the opinion of the majority of our citizens on the matter.
Instead of a debate about the future of the Union, we should have a debate about the convalescence of democracy in the institutions of the European Union.
<D>
in writing. - (PL) The subject of innovative medicines is particularly close to my heart, because I am actively involved in Poland with helping children suffering from rare genetic diseases.
Unfortunately, these children are not covered by any health insurance programmes, and the medicines they require are too expensive.
In most European countries, the cost of the medicines needed to keep such children alive and give them the opportunity to live near-normal lives is refunded.
As a Member of the European Parliament, I realise how important a European approach to the whole issue of medicines is.
I refer to innovation, Union support for research and for scientists, and also to Union encouragement of pharmaceutical concerns, urging them to develop new medicines.
In my opinion, the report by Mrs Grossetête is very important indeed.
I agree that the Union must change to a new and more effective method of managing research and innovation aimed at promoting the economic development of our continent, bringing relief to our citizens and even saving their lives in some cases.
The European Commission's proposal to create joint technology initiatives will harmonise and simplify project financing.
With regard to research programmes on innovative medicines, it is important to involve SMEs, universities, patients, hospitals and the pharmaceutical industry, to ensure that medicines are safer, cheaper and more readily available.
The public-private partnerships proposed by the Commission are therefore an excellent solution.
They represent a new option for the pharmaceutical research sector.
<D>
Vice-President of the Commission. - You asked about a breakdown by Member State, for staff.
That is available in our statistics.
All the figures are available, so please contact our people and they will give you detailed numbers.
Subject: Impact of the growing number of EU officials on pension costs
In the last seven years the number of permanent employees in the Commission has apparently risen by some 16% to almost 20 000 officials.
At the start of this year, following the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, more than 700 officials were recruited with the task of strengthening the internal market.
Clearly, the growing number of EU officials has implications for the budget, and above all an alarming increase in pension costs may be expected.
In 2008 pension costs apparently rose by more than 10%, at the expense, of course, of European taxpayers.
How does the Commission see growth in the number of Commission officials in the near future?
Has a form of freeze on the number of officials already been considered?
Is the Commission aware of the financial implications, above all as far as pension costs are concerned?
<D>
(HU) Mr Tarabella will surely forgive me if I do not start by thanking him now, but direct my thanks first of all to Commissioner Špidla, since he is here with us probably for the last time in his capacity as commissioner.
I would like to emphasise his dedication in dealing with gender equality, women's employment and similar problems.
Several questions came up in connection with the report.
I wish to draw attention to at least two points: one is the wage gap between men and women.
The most recent statistics indicate a difference of more than 17%.
Improvement is not only slow but also ambiguous, since this figure is higher than it was two years ago.
And we do not really know yet what the consequences of the crisis will be.
Daily experience suggests that improvement in the short term is not likely.
What is fundamentally unacceptable, however, is the fact that wage differences show up not in the case of those who are at the start of their careers, but when mothers return to the labour market after maternity or parental leaves.
In a Europe struggling with a demographic crisis, this in itself is disturbing and totally unacceptable.
Such discrimination is obviously forbidden by EU regulations.
As has already been mentioned, the pertinent legal standard dates back to 1975, and it is obvious that this directive, like many others, is completely ineffective.
I am very glad Commissioner Špidla announced that we can expect a report in 2010 on steps the Commission intends to take in order to make legislation more effective.
I would like to add just one more sentence concerning the Charter of Women's Rights.
It is probably more important and urgent to improve the effectiveness and accessibility of existing laws than to create a new legal standard which will be just as ineffective as the previous ones.
<D>
(RO) Madam President, terrorism is a complex phenomenon with a long history, embodied in various forms, from subversive movements aiming at suppressing the sovereignity of states and internal order, triggering civil wars, to attempts, murders and pogroms.
This is the reason why this issue should be approached realistically, with responsibility, and specialists from various fields of expertise should take part in the related debates.
The 9/11 terrorist attacks, the tens of thousands victims and the huge damage urge society, the European states and institutions, to take concerted, systematic and permanent action on several axes some of which I would like to remind you of:
1. objectively searching for the causes of this phenomenon and the permanent amelioration thereof.
2. discovering the financing sources for terrorist acts and transnational political and financial networks.
3. determining the relationship between terrorism per se, weapons policy and wars for capturing strategic raw material sources, on the pretence of the fight against terrorism.
Any unilateral approach to the issue of terrorism does not contribute to finding out the truth about it and stamping out this dangerous transnational phenomenon.
<D>
rapporteur. - (FI) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Diamandouros, ladies and gentlemen, first I wish to thank all parties for their excellent levels of cooperation whilst this report was being produced.
It was not easy finding a solution that would satisfy everyone, and I understand that some people are still hoping for some changes, but we have achieved a unanimous result in committee.
It seems appropriate to move forward from here.
There were four issues relating to the role of Ombudsman.
These were access to documents, the testimonials of officials, information on criminal cases, and cooperation in the field of human rights.
There was also a fifth issue in the European Ombudsman's original proposal, his or her power to intervene, but this was contentious and right at the end of the discussion the Ombudsman said that he wanted to withdraw it.
The most important amendment concerns the obligation of the EU institutions and bodies also to grant the Ombudsman access to classified information and sensitive documents, if deemed necessary for the Ombudsman to do his or her job.
Up till now the institutions have had the right to refuse to disclose information.
This will now be the subject of objective, and no longer subjective or arbitrary, consideration.
This is an important, albeit small, step in the right direction.
The institutions supplying classified information or documents to the Ombudsman must inform the Ombudsman of their classified status.
Furthermore, for the rules to be implemented, the Ombudsman may agree with the relevant institutions the operational conditions for access to classified information or other information covered by the obligation of professional secrecy.
The role of the European Ombudsman has become more important over the years for the European Union institutions and the citizens of Europe.
With the Lisbon Treaty, the Charter of the Fundamental Rights of the European Union will become legally binding, which will make the job of the Ombudsman even more important.
In the future we will need to do more to ensure that the Ombudsman has sufficient resources, that his or her Statute reflects the current times, that he or she obtains the information needed and that officials give him or her the right information.
Under the Charter of Fundamental Rights, every person has the right to have his or her affairs handled impartially, fairly and within a reasonable time by the institutions and bodies of the Union.
The resources therefore have to be in place so that citizens do not have to wait years for decisions and can also have confidence in the fact that the Ombudsman will be in possession of all the necessary information and that officials will tell him or her what they know instead of what they want to say.
Otherwise there is no rule of law, something we are so fond of talking about, even if the EU is not a state as such.
We ourselves should also comply with the rule of law; only then can we expect others to.
<D>
President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I must say that it is to be expected, given the nature of the Union, that we should hear a variety of positions in this House.
This debate - and I am delighted to say this - was of a high quality, apart from the remarks by Mr Batten, which I personally found shocking.
That speech apart, however, the others have been perfectly legitimate.
I would also like to thank Mrs Neyts and Mr Couteaux for their recommendations for reading, which will enable us to enrich our perspective on the relations between Napoleon and Russia, and allow Benita and I to become better acquainted with those between Austria and Russia.
With regard, more fundamentally, to the origin and development of the conflict, I will make three remarks in relation to the EU Presidency: the first is that, obviously, the use of force was an error; the second is that there was a disproportionate reaction by Russia, but, as was emphasised this morning, in order for there to be a reaction, there had to have been some action, even if the reaction remains disproportionate; and the third is that the European Union would like an independent international enquiry on the origin and development of the conflict.
On the extent of the Russian withdrawal and the stability of the Caucasus, I would also like to say that we must not behave as though nothing happened, either.
We have been told: 'The Presidency is acting as though relations were normal'.
No, I mean, certain things have happened since August, after all.
Two months ago, we were confronted with an armed conflict; on 10 October we were able to observe the Russian withdrawal from the adjacent zones.
As I said, this is a vital additional step.
This does not mean that Russia has fulfilled all of its obligations, of this we are fully aware - and I am responding here to the speakers who stressed the problems that are present in the region of Akhalgori - but, at this stage, the most important thing is to embark, now, on a political process.
This is the goal of the talks currently under way in Geneva.
The message of the European Union is that there must no longer be zones of influence on this continent.
The European Union and Russia belong to the same neighbourhood, for the benefit of which we need to cooperate, not to oppose one another.
As regards the resumption of negotiations on the partnership, I would say that the negotiation of the future agreement has been postponed, not suspended, for the legal reasons also referred to during this morning's debate, and, as the European Council said on 15 October, the continuation of these negotiations will incorporate the assessment that the Commission and the Council have been asked to carry out.
This is entirely logical, as Mrs Neyts has moreover emphasised.
I would point out that we need to distinguish clearly between the resumption of negotiations and the holding of the European Union-Russia Summit of 14 November.
That summit will take place, and, as this debate has shown, it is more important than ever.
The summit in itself is not intended to be an exercise in negotiating the future partnership agreement.
I would also like to return to what several speakers said regarding the notion of interdependence.
It is true that such interdependence must be seen in a broad sense.
It exists in all fields: it exists in the field of energy, obviously, and I would even say that, for certain EU Member States, it is a dependence that we need to solve by diversifying the sources of supply.
Moreover, we are also dependent in the field of international security, and it is for this reason that the European Union must not leave unanswered the proposals of the Russian President, Mr Medvedev, in favour of a new European security framework, even if the European Union's point of view is not necessarily the same as that of Russia.
I would like in this regard to point out, as a number of you have done, our adherence to the Helsinki Final Act and to the Charter of Paris, documents to which Russia is also a signatory, as Mr Onyszkiewicz rightly emphasised.
In this context, we clearly need, as several of you have stressed, a sober analysis of our relations with Russia.
There is no question of our returning to the Cold War, nor of our compromising our values and our principles.
In order to ensure this, however, it is more necessary than ever for us to establish a dialogue with Russia.
I would like to thank all those who have congratulated the French Presidency of the European Union on its work, and especially Mr Wielowieyski and Mr Tannock.
The French Presidency acted all the more effectively - and I wish to conclude with this - because it was able to rely on the support of all the Member States, of the European Commission and of this House.
Division within the European Union would no doubt be the best way for Russia to weaken the EU.
In light of the very sharp polarisation of the debate between the States that have joined us most recently and the older members of the EU, it should be stressed that, now more than ever, what we need, and this debate has shown it, is unity in our handling of the Georgian crisis, and unity in our dialogue with Russia: unity on the part of the European Union in condemning the use of force by the parties and the violation of territorial integrity; unity of the European Union in its action, that is, in the deployment of civilian observers on the ground; and, finally, unity of the European Union in defining its interests, in particular in the area of energy and in the more global area of international security.
It is on the basis of such unity that, when the time comes, negotiations of a future agreement with Russia will resume.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, a number of key elements have been included in the overall compromise package that is now proposed.
Most importantly, it contains the following elements:
the time extension option for PM10 is kept at the level of the common position; there can be no delay in taking the measures and a single step approach will reduce the administrative burden;
standards for particulate matter PM10 are unchanged in accordance with the original Commission proposal;
a realistic and timely annual PM2.5 target and a limit value set at 25 µg per cubic metre to be achieved at 2010 and 2015 respectively;
an indicative limit value for 2020 that adds to the ambitious PM2.5 agenda for the mandatory review in 2013;
a legally binding exposure concentration obligation in 2015 that complements the exposure reduction target in triggering prompt measures that are expected to provide the maximum public health benefit; and
a Commission declaration on the progress in developing the Community measures at source.
The new recital 15 also strengthens the determination of the two co-legislators to consider as a matter of priority the legislative proposals put forward by the Commission to address emission at source at Community level.
I know that these elements were all-important to Parliament at first reading and in the committee this time round.
I believe that the proposed current compromise will satisfy Parliament as important ground was won on the key principle of the ambitious yet realistic ambient air quality standard setting, with a clear roadmap including the adoption of the necessary Community measures and a well-defined review in 2013.
I am also particularly pleased to note the importance given by both Parliament and the Council to finding a compromise in this directive.
The resulting compromise, as well as the demonstrated resolve, enables the European Union to take the effective next steps in ensuring healthier air for its citizens.
To conclude, the Commission is very pleased with the outcome of the negotiations.
It can accept the proposed compromise amendments in full.
I wish to thank and to congratulate, once more, the rapporteur, Mr Krahmer, for all his efforts to reach an agreement at second reading.
<D>
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it seems as though the peace of Christmas is upon us - everything is passing off so peacefully.
Unfortunately, I have to add a sour note to the proceedings.
The Council, which is not represented here today, has taken months to revise and reconsider the proposals presented by the Commission and to come up with a solution in a situation where we have huge, rising unemployment.
It is therefore not the fault of Parliament.
In this case the people responsible for the budget were even ahead of us in the energy field.
That certainly did not make our life very easy.
Normally, they are the blockers.
But then we tried to find a solution, and the Commissioner was very helpful, but the Council was obdurate.
Our concern - and this really ought to be self-evident - is that all the budget appropriations that cannot be disbursed should be allocated to projects to create jobs, especially in projects aimed at energy security, energy efficiency and energy conservation.
This really ought to be self-evident.
Were we to ask the citizens of Europe whether they would be in favour of allocating money that is not spent to this particular area, the vast majority would say yes.
Only the Council has not yet acknowledged that this is actually what is needed.
In this context, all of us - including the members of the new Parliament - should insist that this is exactly what is implemented.
I do not know whether Mr Piebalgs will still be a Commissioner and will still be responsible for this area, but I hope that the Commission is also of the opinion that we must ensure that all budget appropriations that cannot be disbursed are transferred in other areas to employment-related projects concerned with energy efficiency and energy security.
Finally, I would like to thank both Commissioners for their cooperation both personally and on behalf of my Group.
Whether it was always a pleasure is another matter, but you were always prepared to engage in dialogue, and I hope you can say that of us too.
We are in the middle of an election campaign but things are a bit calmer for you now.
I do think, however, that you can live without us parliamentarians.
<D>
Commissioner, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, against the backdrop of an economic and financial crisis, we must support the European Union in its efforts to achieve a more efficiently run and effective tax system.
The Commission's proposal to amend the directive on taxation of savings in other Member States offers an opportunity to improve the existing scheme.
Those of us in the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs support extending its application to new financial instruments and geographical areas.
Europe's Liberal Democrats proposed the inclusion of territories with particularly lightly regulated tax regimes, such as the states of Delaware and Nevada in the US, as well as an assurance of equal treatment between Member States and a reduction in the administrative burden involved with implementing the directive.
However, Commissioner, the basic debate remains whether to abolish the system of tax calculation at source in favour of the automated exchange of information.
From a Liberal viewpoint, the issue here is how we will manage to increase tax revenue collection and how enforcement only of the exchange of information will not result - a fact which is confirmed according to the research already carried out - in preventing tax abuses or in increasing revenue collection, but it will only deprive some Member States of their competitive advantage.
Taxation at source is not only more efficient, but also offers greater transparency during collection.
I firmly believe that Member States must retain their autonomy when it comes to selecting a taxation system.
The ALDE Group made the suggestion for a comparative analysis to be carried out of the two systems.
We hope that we will have the results from the Commission at least by December 2010.
We also hope that these results will provide the basis for future Commission proposals on amending the savings taxation system within the European Union.
Tomorrow we are voting on another important text concerning VAT fraud relating to imports.
The objective of this directive is to ensure the rapid exchange of adequate, good-quality information.
In this case, five years is a fairly long period for the business sector.
It also aims to introduce a shared liability mechanism.
While protecting every Member State's tax revenue, it is important however for us to ensure that joint liability only comes into play when the information supplied contains serious irregularities or there is an unjustified delay in providing it.
Otherwise, we risk imposing a further harmful burden on business.
I hope that we will vote in favour of these reports tomorrow.
<D>
(PL) Mr President, the draft resolution once more draws attention to the demographic threat facing Europe.
Responsibility for the future of our continent, and for its social and economic development, demands that special attention be given to this issue.
A birth rate of about 1.5 on average is too low.
In order to guarantee a simple replacement of generations, this figure must exceed 2.15.
Promotion of model families with a small number of children or none, conditions of family life that do not guarantee a decent and stable economic situation (as a result of the impact of unemployment and lowered employment standards, particularly as regards the duration of employment) and punishment of women for motherhood through pension systems have undoubtedly contributed to the threats that have arisen.
The ageing of society, which stems to a significant extent from the otherwise positive phenomenon of longer human life, but also from the deteriorating ratio between the number of people who are gainfully employed and the number of pensioners, is causing major financial problems for pension systems.
In this situation, action must be taken to bring about change.
I am, however, going to dissent from the conviction to be found in the report that this problem will be resolved for us by migration movements.
Studies carried out in Poland by the Institute for Market Economics indicate that the boost to population numbers achieved by this method will be barely 2-3%, in other words far too small.
This method also gives rise to social problems, as can currently be seen in Denmark, France and Germany.
Integration processes take a long time.
I would like to draw your attention at this point to the report's suggestions regarding rights for the families of economic migrants.
The amendments that I have proposed result from a lack of precision regarding whether this means family in the sense of the law of the emigrant's country of birth, or of the country that is accepting the emigrant.
I am particularly concerned about potential polygamy and the legal and economic consequences arising therefrom in the case of social services being made available to these families.
I would also like...
(The President cut off the speaker.)
<D>
(HU) It is perhaps no coincidence that the preparation of the 2010 budget is attracting this much attention.
All this attention is fully justified in view of the worsening unemployment and the difficulties caused by the economic crisis.
As the rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I wish to express my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Surján, for the professional way in which he has handled the relevant dossiers.
We specified earlier the following priorities in the opinion recorded by me in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
We obviously gave number one priority to instruments aimed at alleviating the effects of the financial and economic crisis on Europe's citizens.
We supported every proposal, including the 8.4% increase intended to boost competitiveness, that we hope will retain jobs or create new ones and contribute to the economic recovery plan, the renewed Lisbon strategy, as well as the lifelong learning programme.
We also highlighted the tasks associated with the Social Fund, vocational training, obtaining technical qualifications and lifelong learning.
I feel that it is particularly important that we managed to earmark EUR 25 million in funding for the future microfinance facility in 2010.
Yesterday, we debated this new facility.
Hopefully, we will be able to agree quickly on the other funding details as well.
I believe that it is important for the budget to emphasise the significance of the funding for the activities and policies under budget line 1a.
They will contribute to sustainable development and job creation.
I would especially welcome the items intended to improve the situation of small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as the support given to the Progress programme, the EURES consultancy and information network and pilot projects such as the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund.
Taking all these together, I feel that the objectives defined by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs can play a major role in the budget, for which we owe a debt of gratitude to the rapporteurs.
<D>
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I would very much like to congratulate the Court of Auditors for the work which it is submitting to Parliament in the form of the Annual Report for 2007.
In a series of constantly improving annual reports, in my opinion this is the best report that the Court of Auditors has so far presented.
It is more informative, more colourful, so to speak, and clearer.
Members of the Court of Auditors, I have noted with satisfaction that you have resisted the temptation to add a touch of populism to this year's report.
On the basis of a number of different special reports and, in particular, this report, we will now have to evaluate whether the work done by the Commission in 2007 using European taxpayer's money was satisfactory or not.
So far there have been a number of encouraging presentations, in particular from the Commissioner for the Cohesion Fund.
The Commissioner for Research has also indicated that the criticism from this House and from the Court of Auditors in last year's report has fallen on fertile ground.
One area where things are still not working well is the cooperative effort to control the European budget which Member States are withdrawing from.
Four Member States - Denmark, the Netherlands, the UK and Sweden - are giving an encouraging example of active cooperation.
It is satisfying to see that a national court of auditors, such as that in Germany, is beginning to concern itself at a national level with the European money being spent in Germany and we hope that there will be a political debate on this subject.
Since the Wynn and Mulder reports we have been attempting to bridge the gap in the treaty between Article 274 and Article 5 by means of this requirement for national statements of assurance.
While we are discussing this subject, Commissioner Kallas, I would be happy for the Commission to take a more helpful and active role in standardising these reports.
This is something which your positive approach should help to bring about one of these days.
When we pass judgment on the quality of the Commission's work in our discharge, we will inform the taxpayers whether or not it is acceptable in overall terms.
If we expect professionalism from other institutions, we must also take a more professional approach ourselves.
I believe that it is both intolerable and ludicrous to hold debates in this House about whether this committee can continue to be a so-called neutral committee or not.
It is not acceptable for a control committee to be regarded simply as a sort of add-on committee, because that is not professional.
The times have long gone when the budget came under consideration in one place for six months or so and then for the rest of the year another committee was responsible for budget control.
We have not even looked at all the agencies yet and we are supposed to assure our taxpayers that everything is functioning correctly.
We need professionalism from the other institutions, but we as a Parliament must also make an effort, otherwise we will not be able to stand up in front of the taxpayers.
<D>
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the beekeeping sector is not only a productive operation with age-old origins in the history of our agricultural activities, but currently it is one of the systems that is vital in maintaining the level of productivity of tree and herbaceous crops, thanks to cross-pollination.
I would like to point out that 80% of plants grown produce fruit because of the pollen carried by bees, also ensuring genetic variation of species in reproduction.
It is clear that, at the moment, the beekeeping sector and its operations cannot be replaced and are the only way of maintaining biodiversity on target.
The products of the hives must increasingly frequently compete on the global market under competition conditions that lack transparency and through the mass importation of products, including those from outside the EU, which are not guaranteed.
It is not always possible to guarantee their quality, partly because of pesticides which are banned in Europe but are used outside.
For this reason, it is necessary to carry out labelling and to place the origin of the product on it.
I also believe it is important to point to the serious consequences for beekeeping operations of the virus, as a result of which over 50% of the European beekeeping sector has been destroyed.
I ask the European Commission to make further efforts in terms of scientific research to find a way of dealing with this serious disease, by banning any type of phytosanitary treatment during flowering periods.
<D>
(NL) Mr President, I too should like to thank Mrs Lucas and also Mr Zaleski sincerely for their efforts in bringing about this resolution.
After all, regrettably, trade in illegally or unsustainably harvested timber is still taking place on a large scale in Europe.
The European Commission's 2003 FLEGT Action Plan, specifically intended to prevent trading in illegally harvested timber in Europe, has had only a very limited effect.
For this reason, it is regrettable that the European Commission has yet to present the new proposals.
After all, misconduct on the part of importers still seems to pay, as action is hardly ever taken against the illegal trade and there are no sanctions.
Responsibly minded timber importers therefore pay a high price, both literally and figuratively, for compliance with environmental and safety standards, since trade in the much cheaper illegal timber is still taking place on a large scale.
The timber industry itself has already undertaken some sound initiatives, such as certification.
We must underpin these with binding legislation, in accordance with the WTO framework.
For this reason, I also advocate the recognition of existing certification systems that have been set up partly by the sector itself and partly by NGOs.
What Mrs Lucas wants, namely the creation of a new European body too, would entail a great deal of red tape and is in our view unnecessary.
Of course, measures must be taken locally in the regions to combat illegal logging, but we also expect the European Commission to present a proposal for the introduction of sanctions, which should also have a preventive effect on timber importers.
After all, if we do not impose sanctions on businesses engaging in illegal trade, the danger is that this illegal behaviour will continue to pay, and that is what we must eliminate.
<D>
(PT) This revised version of the Cotonou Agreement introduces key issues for sustainable development and the gradual integration of ACP countries into the global economy.
Issues such as climate change, energy security, training and education are essential for development in these countries.
At the same time, global warming may present an opportunity.
The costs of renewable energy that these countries have at their disposal are essential for their economic and social development, and allow them to move towards a state of independence in terms of energy, so that they can face up to the global crisis.
Investment in education and training is equally important in combating poverty, unemployment, emigration and the brain drain, and will help to build the economy in these countries.
To conclude, I would like to make special mention of the small island countries that are particularly vulnerable and fragile.
In view of this, the implementation of the Cotonou Agreement should take account of the Mauritius Strategy and the Barbados Action Plan, which identify a number of measures to assist developing island countries in bringing about sustainable development.
<D>
(PL) Mr President, the universal nature of European art shows the need to give schools back their roles as the main centres for spreading culture.
This is an opportunity to democratise access to culture.
Art education develops sensitivity and opens up creative potential.
It should be an obligatory element of the school curriculum at all levels of development.
The European Year of Art and Innovation is an excellent occasion to restore art to its rightful place - in education as well - so that its integrational role can be appreciated.
Protecting the traditional cultural identity of individual regions and the ability to find out about them thanks to mobility, including in the field of cultural education, is a further chance for creative development.
That is why setting up a community mobility framework for Europeans engaged in artistic and creative activity is so important.
That is the reason for my vote in favour of the report, although I would also protest against the fast-track procedure of the debate on this document, and its adoption with practically no debate.
<D>
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs. - (PL) Mr President, the idea that was floated in 2005, of setting up a European Institute of Technology, is in every way deserving of support.
The proposed structure of the network of Knowledge and Innovation Communities has a chance to become an excellent stimulator of innovation throughout the EU.
Providing a proper legal basis and consequently enabling permanent funding of the Institute was my priority as draftsman of the committee asked for an opinion under the Committee on Legal Affairs.
In this context, conferring on the Institute the status of an agency on the basis of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006, and specifically part C of it and Article 47, is of immeasurable importance, as is the Committee's proposal concerning the increase in the margin in section 1A in the budget for 2007-2013, guaranteeing the Institute EUR 309 million.
The birth of the EIT is especially important for the scientific milieu in the new part of the united Europe, which has an inherent vast and so far unexploited potential.
I therefore warmly support the decision of the authorities in Wrocław who are seeking to get the Governing Board or one of the knowledge communities to set up their offices in the city, where as many as 140 000 students are studying.
Finally may I convey my warmest congratulations and thanks to Reino Paasilinna for excellent cooperation, and my congratulations on a superb report.
<D>
(SV) Thank you, Mr President.
The report is good throughout.
It is well balanced and gives an objective description of developments in Macedonia; commending what has been achieved and appealing for a little more time to be devoted to what remains to be done.
But, as so often before, the debate is reduced to discussing our various views of the dispute over the country's name rather than working out how we can get Macedonia into the EU as soon as possible.
We all know what happened at the summit in Bucharest.
I will not go into who was right or wrong or who had greater national interests to defend, but I have to say that foreign policy is not just a matter of who is right and who is wrong.
Foreign policy is about getting solutions which best serve peace and security in one's own country or region and, in our case, Europe.
This is achieved by a mixture of goodwill, compromise, good diplomacy and clear leadership.
To prevent a country in southern Europe from becoming a member of NATO when the possibility arose is, to my mind, not a particularly wise move, given the complexity of the situation in the Balkans right now and all the challenges we face: independence in Kosovo, which is a fait accompli, the departure of the government and new elections in Serbia and still-ongoing police reforms in Bosnia.
But to block the EU membership of a Balkan country, or even just to think of doing so, is not just unwise but downright dangerous!
Only three hours ago I spoke with a colleague here in the European Parliament who said: 'If they don't do as we want, we can block them, not just in NATO, but in the EU.
The law entitles us to do so'.
My reaction is to say: then we must change the law!
Surely laws are not there for us to block, disrupt or blackmail one another?
Surely they are there so that we can all get along together as best we can in a peaceful and secure Europe?
It is my firm opinion that, the sooner all the Balkan countries are in the EU, the sooner we shall have a secure Europe.
There is absolutely no doubt that Macedonia belongs to Europe and that Macedonia should be brought into the EU as quickly as possible.
I urge you to support the report.
<D>
(EL) Madam President, I listened very carefully to the speeches by the President of the Central Bank and by Jean-Claude Juncker, for whom I have considerable respect.
We are undoubtedly facing a major economic crisis, unparalleled in recent decades.
The frightening increase in the price of oil and of many other products, the high unemployment rate, the widespread poverty and the low rates of growth all contribute to this stark image.
There has been extended discussion of the criticism that has been voiced.
I believe that this criticism, which also came from official sources, has all had the same goal of highlighting the gravity of the situation.
Besides, as politicians, we must seek criticism, because it is only through criticism that we can improve, see the issues more clearly and thus reach solutions that benefit the community.
Finally, I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on his truly exceptional report.
<D>
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate Mr Hegyi on his wonderful report which I am sure will make a vital contribution to initiating civil dialogue in the European Union.
The successful achievement of the European institutions' overall communication priorities in partnership with Member States will be an important step towards making the European Union's citizens better informed.
Only well-informed Europeans can make use of the opportunities offered to them and take part in an active dialogue on Europe.
We have all witnessed the consequences resulting from the problems with ensuring people are kept informed: 'No' votes in referendums and the blocking of European development.
As chairwoman of a citizens association in Bulgaria, I strongly believe that getting citizens involved in the decision-making processes will give them the opportunity to contribute directly to the political process at EU level.
I believe that this is one of the important areas which must be quickly reformed and improved.
I believe that this report will enable the European Parliament to give the necessary guidelines and recommendations to the other institutions, but also to the civil organisations because citizens are the key element in Europe's future development.
Without their cooperation and involvement, it will be impossible for us to achieve the objective which we have set ourselves.
<D>
in writing. - I broadly welcome the rapporteur's report and agree that the development of the single market has delivered a range of benefits for Europe's citizens, notably by providing consumers with a wider choice and lower prices, creating a dynamic business environment and enabling the free exchange of goods, services and ideas.
This in turn has facilitated European integration across a range of areas and continues to underpin the EU's ability to achieve its broad objectives.
However, I have reservations about particular elements of this report:
I do not agree that the introduction of a common consolidated tax base is either necessary or desirable, as suggested in this report.
I believe that such a proposal, were it to be tabled by the Commission, would be a first step towards tax harmonisation, which I would find unacceptable.
I believe that Member States are best placed to determine the nature and scope of their respective tax systems.
Finally, I believe that the report's reference to nuclear power as an essential part of the EU's energy mix is misplaced and I will not be supporting this element of the report.
<D>
in writing. - (FR) Mrs Castex voted for the Mantovani report on the establishment of a European Qualifications Framework.
This French Member of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament welcomes the future introduction of the European Qualifications Framework, which will facilitate transnational mobility for workers and learners, while at the same time meeting the requirements of the labour market by way of a common reference point for the transposition of qualification levels.
According to the proposal all qualifications, from the end of compulsory education to the highest levels of university teaching and professional training (the Commission's initial document only concerned general educational qualifications), should be classified according to one of eight reference levels based on knowledge, ability and acquired skills.
Mrs Castex believes that the EQF, as a tool for comparing, translating and converting the qualifications of one Member State to those of another, will respect the diversity of the certification systems and the richness of the qualifications that exist in the European Union.
It is a tool that will also facilitate greater mobility for the citizens of Europe.
It is now up to the Member States to set about the massive task of classifying the reference levels required for the EQF, otherwise the European Qualifications Framework will be destined to remain an empty shell.
<D>
The final draft agenda drawn up on Thursday, 4 February 2010 by the Conference of Presidents pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed.
The following amendments have been proposed:
Monday:
No changes.
Tuesday:
The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) has submitted a request to add to the agenda Council and Commission statements on the difficult monetary and economic situation of euro area countries.
This concerns Member States which are experiencing financial difficulties.
<D>
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Mr President, the timing of the Commission Green Paper and the report by Mr Florenz is excellent.
It is really high time the European Union returned to the issue of tobacco, as silence has surrounded the subject for too long.
The Florenz report rightly focuses on smoking among young people and the harmful effects of passive smoking in workplaces, public buildings and catering and drinking establishments.
On the subject of young people, research has shown that 90% of smokers start smoking as children, as under 18s.
I am very pleased with the ambitious objectives of the Florenz report to significantly reduce smoking among this age group.
After all, young people are susceptible to peer pressure and, in addition, the harmful effects on health are greater in this group.
It is my hope, therefore, that the Member States - who think, of course, that they themselves can do everything best and that we must on no account become too involved - will respond to this House's appeal to commit themselves to halving the harmful effects of smoking among young people by 2025, so that they actually take action by agreeing with each other to do so.
With regard to passive smoking and the general smoking ban, a sound liberal principle is that one's personal freedom ends where another's begins - and what clearer illustration of this principle can there be than unwilling passive smoking?
Passive smoking inflicts great harm on public health and entails costs for the European economy.
Each year more than 79 000 adults die in the EU Member States as a result of passive smoking, and there is proof that passive smoking in the workplace accounted for 7 000 deaths in the European Union in 2002, whilst exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke at home was responsible for a further 72 000 deaths.
Of course, ample experience of this kind of smoking ban has been gained already in countries such as Ireland, Scotland and Italy, and this experience is actually all positive.
The comments from these countries - including from people who had been very sceptical about this kind of measure - are ultimately positive.
Thus, it is tempting to issue a smoking ban at European level, too.
Recently, in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, this House decided against imposing a European smoking ban at this time, instead opting to leave such measures to Member States.
I think this is the right decision, as such a controversial decision should be taken as closely as possible to the citizen for the time being - that is, at Member State or regional level.
Therefore, the call on the part of those Member States who already have a smoking ban for the voluntary signing of a European charter in order to bring greater clarity for consumers strikes me as the most that can be achieved at present.
What is extremely good - and in this respect I commend the Commissioner on his Green Paper - is the promotion of this discussion that has indisputably taken place.
The issue is on the agenda in all Member States.
Mr President, I should like to make some concluding remarks about the Directive on tobacco products.
The Florenz report also looks towards the revision of this Directive.
I support everything the report says about picture warnings on cigarette packets.
It is tragic that so few Member States have made use of these, and personally I would be in favour of legislating in this regard.
Moreover, it should be possible to use these warnings in other ways, too, for example on the kind of information leaflets on how to stop smoking that they have in Canada; the experience with this has been positive, and it also strikes me as an excellent idea.
<D>
- Madam President, as you can see, my colleagues are jealous of our relationship, which is why they have acted as our chaperones here this afternoon.
I hope my words meet with your seal of approval.
We all know that the car industry is having some serious financial problems.
They are documented on a daily basis in all our national newspapers.
In the region I represent, there is a large Toyota plant at Burnaston in Derby, where various measures to cut costs have already been enacted to meet the new financial environment.
In the excellent new UK parliamentary constituency of Daventry, the McClaren Formula 1 precision engine plant is based, employing over 600 people.
So all of us here know or represent some part of the car industry and we know of the financial problems that there are.
But we have actually managed to compound them in this place by passing regulation after regulation after regulation in the good times, not looking forward to when times might be slightly leaner.
The car industry cannot cope with the regulations that we have enforced.
Thank you for my extra time.
I know the bit at the beginning perhaps cost me some seconds.
<D>
(PL) Mr President, matters relating to health fall within the competence of individual Member States.
This should not, however, represent an obstacle when it comes to taking joint action aimed at protecting the health of Europeans.
The key objectives are laid down in the White Paper.
They include promoting health in an ageing Europe, protecting citizens against dangers to their health and supporting dynamic health systems.
These objectives cannot be achieved without substantial involvement by local and regional authorities.
The latter must therefore be fully involved in implementation of this strategy.
The White Paper raises the important issue of health inequalities and of the variations in health levels between individual countries and social groups.
The provision of certain healthcare services in most of the new Member States is low.
This gap must be bridged.
It is therefore necessary to strengthen action aimed at doing away with inequality and to make this a priority objective.
Another task identified in the White Paper relates to the need to emphasise and enhance the importance of programmes involving health awareness, notably those concerning nutrition.
Sound nutrition and a healthy lifestyle can prevent many chronic diseases.
That is why educational programmes on how to watch one's diet and engage in physical activity from a very early age are so very important.
<D>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the 2011 budget guidelines are the first step towards the next European budget, a very definite step.
In the Committee on Budgets, we have made a great effort to establish the main identifiable priorities that highlight European action.
The first priority is young people, not only because they are the resource on which to focus for innovation, research and development, but also because they are the basic starting point for farsighted social policies.
However, the 2020 strategy is also a main priority: tackling unemployment, climate change and, above all, the need to genuinely and practically implement this new strategy for the future, allocating sufficient resources to it, without compromises and without cuts.
However, these guidelines are also a very realistic first step.
There is much less leeway in the financial perspective and this means that there are insufficient resources to carry out what is most important: new actions.
This is particularly sensitive with regard to the first heading, the heading on competitiveness, growth and employment.
There is, however, another important issue: the budget also needs to be highly flexible and to be able to respond quickly to citizens' needs, to people's needs and to changing needs.
So there are priorities, but there are also essential conditions in order for the budget to really be a useful instrument to help Europe grow.
These include sufficient resources, clear-cut implementation of future strategies, above all, the 2020 strategy, and lastly a definitive solution for a flexible instrument that - alone - can enable us to face future challenges.
<D>
in writing. - (FR) Cooperation between Member States and the exchange of information are certainly necessary when it comes to immigration policies.
This is particularly important since the Schengen Agreement doing away with all controls at the Union's internal borders means that the decisions taken in one Member State, especially those concerning the regularisation of illegal immigrants, have consequences for, and in, neighbouring countries.
If there is one area in which Europe excels, it is in the creation of agencies, bodies and all kinds of structures, provided with staff and a budget, which justify the Union's action and give the appearance of wanting to resolve the problems.
That is not the case at all, however.
This is particularly true when it comes migration, for which the plethora of existing structures, be they governmental, non-governmental or intergovernmental, sit side by side without any conclusive results.
Research centres, professional bodies, the European migration observatory, Eurostat, Europol, the Fundamental Rights Agency, the Centre for Information, Discussion and Exchange on the Crossing of Frontiers and Immigration (Cirefi), and so on: the list is never-ending.
This report seeks to add an umpteenth: a European Migration Network, the supposed first stage before the creation of a new European observatory or agency.
It is time to curb this Europe of excess and pretence.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - (CS) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, 10 years after the inclusion of Article 13 in the EC Treaty we have made important progress in making sure that all citizens of the European Union are protected from discrimination based on racial or ethnic origin or sexual orientation, among other things.
However, this protection is not yet complete, nor have we yet the real 'equality' mentioned by the honourable Member.
All the Member States must abide by the so-called Racial Equality Directive and Employment Equality Directive and it is the task of the European Union to monitor the correct transposition of both Directives into national legislation and their effective application.
Consequently, on 27 June 2007 the Commission issued Reasoned Opinions to 14 Member States that have not transposed Directive 2000/43/EC correctly.
I want to state that the factual grounds that gave rise to these reasoned opinions vary of course from country to country as does their gravity.
In any event, 14 states have received these reasoned opinions.
2007 is the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All and it has given the public authorities and civil society an incentive to organise actions and campaigns focusing on the benefits of diversity and non-discrimination.
The fight against discrimination must constantly be at the forefront of our mind.
In 2008 the Commission will submit proposals for the European Year of Equal Opportunities follow-up programmes: these may contain measures for finalising the framework of anti-discrimination legislation.
An on-line consultation that was launched in July and will last until mid-October forms part of preparations for assessing the corresponding impact.
I would also like to state that the Commission rejects all forms of homophobia and promotes a society based on tolerance and respect.
It welcomed the European Parliament resolution of 26 April 2007 on homophobia in Europe.
In this context the Commission regrets that local authorities did not grant the necessary permissions for the truck promoting diversity in Europe to visit Vilnius on 25 May as had been planned, and banned the accompanying gay parade.
The Commission also regrets that the participants in the march for diversity during the Romanian GayFest 2007 festival on 11 June (which received moral support and used the European Year logo) were intimidated by extremist groups and needed police protection.
The Racial Equality Directive I mentioned earlier prevents discrimination based on racial or ethnic origin.
I would like to stress that this applies in full to the Roma as well.
Furthermore, the Commission is of the opinion that in order to be applied properly, the EU legislation must be complemented by information campaigns that would inform the Roma of their rights, and by events that will inform the general public about the rights and duties resulting from the anti-discrimination law.
In 2007, the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All, events focusing on the Roma are taking place in Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Greece, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Finland and Slovakia.
Actions aimed at combating discrimination against the Roma are also financed under the auspices of the European Social Fund and PROGRESS 2007-2013, a programme for employment and social solidarity, which supports capacity-building among the Roma.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - (EL) Madam President, I welcome the opportunity that we have this evening of debating the proposal to revise the directive on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes.
I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Parish, and the three parliamentary committees that examined the report for their efforts and their comments.
I am certain that the dialogue which ensues will be constructive.
Numerous Member States have long since adopted their own national legislation on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes.
As a result, there are different levels of protection in Europe.
The review will achieve a harmonised level of protection within the Community and will safeguard the smooth operation of the internal market.
The Commission's aim is to improve the legislation of the European Union governing animal experiments.
On the one hand, this will both limit the number of experimental animals and, on the other hand, it will provide suitable care and treatment of animals subjected to experiments, as required under the Protocol on protection and welfare of animals added to the Treaty establishing the European Community.
Our aim is for this review to considerably improve the welfare of experimental animals within the European Union.
The welfare requirements of animals are now officially included in the Treaty on European Union and must be taken into account when laying down policies in sectors such as the internal market.
Experts and specialists in the animal testing sector, the research community, the industry directly interested and citizens were involved in formulating the proposal with transparent procedures and without exclusions.
The proposal is also based on a carefully substantiated impact assessment.
Moreover, numerous scientific agencies made a significant contribution to this procedure.
A comparative analysis of the possible benefits and the costs of taking action against not taking action was carried out in order to draw up the proposal.
This proposal strikes the necessary balance; on the one hand, it promotes competitiveness and research in Europe and, on the other hand, it takes full account of the welfare requirements of animals.
The Commission has carefully examined the concerns expressed by various sides that the proposal would expel European research from Europe, due to the supposed administrative burden or the cost involved in specific animal welfare requirements.
However, there is no evidence that there will be any such drain to non-EU countries.
Several of the welfare standards contained in our proposal and many of the stricter licensing procedures are already being applied by Member States who lead the way in research globally.
Furthermore, our proposal makes provision for measures to minimise the administrative burden.
There is, in fact, no contradiction between the adoption of strict animal welfare standards and the promotion of a high level of scientific research.
On the contrary, the two concepts are interconnected.
Under the Commission proposal, the licensing of research on animals who are still conscious will be accompanied by systematic independent ethical evaluation.
This will put the principles of restoring, restricting and improving the use of animals into practice.
These provisions are the fundamental objectives of the review.
We shall be unable to achieve our objectives if we replace licensing by tacit agreement to every type of research or if we allow the ethical evaluation to be carried out by those with a direct interest in the research project.
Finally, the Commission wishes to avoid any possible interruption to scientific projects under way and to minimise the administrative burden.
That is why it allows for flexible application and encourages the use of existing infrastructures in the Member States wherever possible.
Ladies and gentlemen, the recast proposal will restore the smooth operation of the internal market, improve animal welfare standards and promote research.
The current legislation urgently needs to be strengthened and improved in a properly balanced manner and that is precisely what the Commission proposal achieves.
<D>
rapporteur. - (EL) Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteurs on their reports, which have given us an opportunity today to debate basic dimensions of future cohesion policy and to express our main positions on them.
However, I should like to comment on Mr Pieper's report, for which I was the shadow rapporteur, because it sets out the detailed positions of the European Parliament on the post-2013 architecture needed for cohesion policy.
I should like to point out that the European Parliament's main positions have already been formulated and approved by plenary in a special chapter of the resolution on the future financial perspective of the European Union as regards cohesion policy.
We shall not be making concessions on those positions.
Future cohesion policy must have an appropriate budget, so that it can effectively meet the new challenges, support all the regions of the European Union, with particular emphasis as always on the regions with the most development problems, include thematic objectives and, at the same time, a degree of flexibility, rely on simplified rules which have been unified to the maximum possible extent between its funds and ensure that all citizens of the Union will be able to enjoy its benefits, even if they are living in the most remote parts of the European Union, on islands and in mountain areas.
Finally, as regards, in particular, the proposal to create an intermediate support category, which both I and my political group and a large majority in Parliament have always supported, I should like to stress that I absolutely agree with the opinion expressed today by Commissioner Hahn.
Its creation is absolutely justified and we want the future regional support system to address regions at the same development level in a fair, simplified and transparent manner.
I believe that we must send out a clear message that the European Union looks behind the statistics, especially in the present economic crisis.
<D>
The global economic crisis has taken us all by surprise, whether we are talking about banks, multinational companies or even transnational institutional structures.
The global economy is badly affected, and the survival of the global financial system is actually at stake.
I do not think anyone will contradict me when I say that the magnitude of the current problems requires a concentrated effort at European level.
Indeed, solidarity is an absolute must to get through this crisis.
I represent Romania in the European Parliament, a country in south-eastern Europe.
All I can say is that the impact of economic growth of more than 7% in 2008 seems about to vanish in the face of the turbulent economic conditions which are starting to hit hard.
The economic recovery plan drawn up by the European Commission must have an impact in every corner of the old continent.
Certain parts of Europe must not feel abandoned and helpless against a hostile situation which they have not provoked.
I think that this is the most important test for the European Union, the boldest political project over the last few hundred years.
The countries on this entire continent must show that they are a single force.
According to José Manuel Durão Barroso, President of the European Commission, Europe will be judged primarily by its results.
I totally concur with this statement.
<D>
Preparing a budget is never an easy process, even less so during an economic crisis.
However, this is all the more reason why this task is even more important.
Managing a crisis of the magnitude of the current one also depends at EU level on the balance that exists in the negotiations between the authorised European institutions.
The European Parliament has undoubtedly a crucial role to play in this debate.
The main issues at the heart of the discussions on the 2010 budget have been the Economic Recovery Plan and the European Milk Fund.
These issues have, in a sense, highlighted how rigid the 2007-2013 financial framework is, as they are new financial projects and therefore new money.
The EU budget needs to make full use of the financial margins to respond to the economic crisis.
However, this budget is likely to have a limited impact if Member States are not going to adopt an active approach to accessing the available resources.
We must send out a strong message to the capitals of Europe, and especially to Bucharest, in my case.
Our efforts here to obtain as much money as possible for the European funds are in vain if, in our home countries, the powers that be do not take the measures required to access and use the funds efficiently.
<D>
(NL) Madam President, the Council wants to see more ambition so that we can strengthen competitiveness and increase convergence.
That is only to be applauded, of course.
I would like to join in the tributes paid to President Barroso for the way in which he has picked up the gauntlet and come here to give us an explanation about the competitiveness pact, something which has even managed to keep Mr Martin Schulz sweet today.
That should not go unmentioned.
You have picked up that gauntlet, together with President Van Rompuy.
However, the pact seems to be having some difficulties getting off the ground, because Parliament, in particular, is having to deal with a sizeable legislative package.
This is the first time Parliament has found itself in the role of colegislator when it comes to economic governance.
That is why it is so important to link things together, because there is some overlap.
In this House, ladies and gentlemen, we have tabled 2 000 amendments and, if we look at this, we will find almost all the matters covered by the competitiveness pact reflected in those amendments.
This Parliament also wants to see more ambition and that is the very thing that worries me.
How are we going to link the competitiveness pact with the EU 2020 strategy?
Moreover, President Barroso, are you going to use our right of initiative actively, to establish a link between the competitiveness pact and the legislative package?
If you fail to do that, then this House will pick up that gauntlet itself, in its role as colegislator.
<D>
I am pleased to say that, as a Portuguese and a Member of the European Parliament, I voted in favour of the re-election of José Manuel Durão Barroso as President of the European Commission.
I believe his performance during the previous mandate, which was beset by so many political, financial and social difficulties, and the experience he acquired in this post, justified the support of the governments and the renewed confidence of this House.
I deplore the many attempts - not all of them open or serious - to prevent his candidacy from succeeding, and I note that they were frustrated not only by a lack of any credible alternative but also by the foolishness of the arguments on which they were based.
I regret that Members from my own country could not resist taking that path, which is as easy as it is inconsequential.
I hope the second Barroso Commission can combine technical competence with that 'something extra'.
I also hope it will effectively respect and make use of the principle of subsidiarity, and will choose the safety and solidity of taking small steps, as recommended by Jean Monnet, rather than adopting the fast-track approach that has promised much but contributed little to the real progress of the European project and dream.
However much we aim for the horizon, we only get there by putting one foot in front of the other.
Let us go the right way.
<D>
(RO) At a time when we need new instruments to kick-start economic growth, I believe that it is important for us to provide small and medium-sized enterprises with easier access to research and development.
Many of these companies suffer due to their difficulty in accessing funding, which means that they are unable to design and develop new products or redesign existing products, thereby encountering a loss of competitiveness.
What would be desirable is for universities, especially those receiving public funding, to be more receptive to the needs of the SME sector.
Cutting red tape combined with an increase in public funding for research and development programmes which can generate technologies or products that can be transferred to SMEs could facilitate access to funding for these programmes under the Structural Funds.
Universities can also contribute to training the SMEs' staff as part of the lifelong learning process.
The launch of a single European network of business and innovation centres is encouraging.
I, too, wish to congratulate the rapporteur.
<D>
The European Commission adopted the 'Renewable Energy and Climate Change' package on 23 January 2008.
This package shares among the Member States, based on criteria and targets, the EU objectives adopted by the European Council in spring 2007.
These are a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of at least 20% at EU level by 2020, along with, during the same period, a 20% increase in the share of renewable energy resources in overall energy consumption, and a 20% increase in energy efficiency.
We can negotiate in every area, but we cannot negotiate with nature.
For this reason, to be able to meet these commitments in terms of reducing GHG emissions and increasing the share of renewable energy sources, major structural reforms are required in every area of the economy.
Romania will adopt the national obligations arising from this legislative package, which will have a significant impact at economic and social level.
The completion of the negotiations on the 'Renewable Energy and Climate Change' package provides an opportunity to strike a balance between combating climate change, increasing suppliers' security and promoting competitiveness and economic growth, as well as creating jobs.
<D>
in writing. - (PT) The establishment of a 'network of contact points' in a framework of cooperation between the various Member States, with the aim of sharing experiences and good practices, could form another asset in the fight against corruption in each country.
According to the EC Treaty, the Community and the Member States are responsible for adopting measures to combat fraud and protect the Community's financial interests.
At Community level there is, for example, a need to guarantee more autonomy and resources for the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).
However, we dislike the fact that this measure is regarded as an embryo and will be used to promote or will be part of the more general objective of developing the so-called 'area of freedom, security and justice', in line with the 2005 Hague Programme, in particular by bringing justice and home affairs within the Community system.
This communitisation process is encouraged and ensured by the Treaty now known as the 'Lisbon' Treaty, by removing from the Member States' sovereignty (from their parliaments and other national institutions) those responsibilities which are at the heart of this sovereignty.
We therefore repeat our reservations about the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor, which is a stage in the process of establishing a future 'European Public Prosecutor's Office' based around Europol, Eurojust and OLAF.
<D>
(NL) Madam President, as you are aware, I am less than enthusiastic about all the health check proposals.
If I was a farmer, and I had calculated in 2005 what to expect up until 2013, then I could expect - if you will bear with me - an 8% cut due to modulation, a 10% cut due to the national reserve and potentially a 9% cut due to capping high bonuses, so a total cut of 27%.
How can an average farmer in future rely on a European government that delivers on its promise?
Mrs Buitenweg said the 27% was inconsequential, but I think it is a fair chunk out of what was promised.
I am also opposed to this modulation, therefore, and I would prefer the capping of these total bonuses to be much more limited.
As for this national reserve, I think we should seize the one opportunity that we have, namely we should develop an insurance scheme that provides cover against animal and plant diseases as soon as possible across the whole of Europe.
Sooner or later, as a result of people travelling so much, Europe will face another contagious animal disease, and our budgets are not prepared for this.
If this were to happen again, I would not know where the Commission would get the money from.
This is where an insurance scheme would come in.
With regard to milk quotas, we can only note that an increasing number of markets are developing internationally.
It is not a good thing for Europe, I think, if we were to say to the Americans or the Brazilians, for example, that that market would be theirs if they wanted it.
We should take part in it too, which is why a soft landing of the milk quotas is necessary.
We could take three measures: reduce the superlevy, gradually increase the quotas and settlement, every year, of what has not reached full milking capacity among the farmers that have milked to full capacity and have even exceeded capacity.
<D>
Today the EU adopted Mr Romagnoli's report on creating a Critical Infrastructure Warning Information Network in the EU, which was not discussed during the plenary session.
I think that the protection of the EU's citizens is of the highest priority in this institution and citizens must know about it.
The creation of this information network will make it possible, based on the exchange of experience and good practice between EU countries, to achieve a better understanding of and higher standards for protecting critical sites and activities which are crucially important to countries and their population.
I would like to mention that, as shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I am pleased with the unanimous adoption by all the political groups in Parliament of the requirement stipulated for Member States' compulsory participation in the new system, which guarantees the importance of this initiative from a European perspective.
I also express my confidence that even after the first few years of the system's successful operation, the European Commission will take the necessary measures to build on this system with additional functions, enabling the rapid distribution of urgent information about threats which have arisen affecting critical infrastructure sites in any region of the EU.
We will then end up with a complete information system which will provide greater security and protection for Europe's citizens.
<D>
First of all, I must commend Mr Mantovani on preparing this very significant document.
The principal aim of this document is to find a way of determining and comparing different qualifications within the labour market and education system.
Without doubt, the European Qualifications Framework (EQF) will have a beneficial impact on the efficiency and flexibility of the EU labour market.
More importantly, the EQF would help to reduce discrimination against both immigrants and EU citizens in the workplace.
Unfortunately, both Lithuanians and citizens of other EU countries have difficulty in using their qualifications in other Member States.
Very often their qualifications are not recognised by employers or institutions.
People feel discriminated against, because they do not have equal opportunities to compete in the labour market.
They often have to accept jobs which pay less and for which they are overqualified.
At a meeting with Lithuanian nationals living and working in London, I was made aware of quite a few complaints regarding discrimination in the workplace and difficulties in obtaining the work for which these people are qualified.
It makes them feel like 'second-class' citizens, yet their qualifications and skills are often much higher than those of the citizens of those countries doing the same kind of work.
They cannot get the job they want or an adequate salary, simply because their qualifications are not recognised.
To sum up, this document is of great importance to most people.
Regretfully, neither the Commission, nor we Members of Parliament, have been able to solve this problem in 22 years.
In 1985 the Council decided to introduce a system to match different countries' professional qualifications.
It has not yet yielded any results.
Unfortunately, once again, we are in no hurry and are proposing not to introduce it until 2012.
Moreover, it is being left to the Member States' discretion.
It is a shame that we are so inefficient.
We should learn from our experience.
<D>
Mr Schmitt's own-initiative report on an agenda for European cooperation for European schools attempts to point out common challenges and threats faced by the schools systems of Member States.
In many places it is right.
This common diagnosis is necessary, if only because of the huge migration taking place within the Community.
The report deserves to be endorsed, but one cannot help feeling that the common values which the rapporteur sees as the foundation of educational reform do not exhaust all the factors which have shaped Europe over the centuries.
Subparagraph 17 refers to the full and multi-faceted development of the individual, cultivating respect for human rights and social justice, lifelong learning for the purposes of personal development and professional advancement, the protection of the environment and personal and collective wellbeing.
These values are desirable, but there are some details missing - I am thinking about the fact that those common values have a source, and that source is the Christian roots of Europe.
Briefly, it is my conviction that unity in the spirit of Christianity is probably the only lasting and fruitful bond.
It is a solid foundation.
Of course, the lack of a reference to this is a flaw not only of this report, but of the entire legislation of the Community.
This leaves doubts as to the direction of the changes.
Today we are saying 'yes' to good values, but we are also asking what those values will be tomorrow.
<D>
The vision shaping this motion for a resolution is made very clear in its preamble.
It takes the view that the multilateral trade system put in place by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) represents the most suitable framework for regulating and promoting open and fair trade and, at the same time, it is working towards the successful conclusion of the Doha Development Agenda.
It is a vision of so-called 'free' trade as a class weapon in the service of big financial institutions and companies, promoting increased exploitation of workers and peoples.
It involves both social dumping, the destruction of productive strength, and environmental dumping, the degradation of the environment.
This trade policy and the agreements giving it concrete expression are increasingly lacking in democratic legitimacy.
They are almost always negotiated in secret, behind the public's backs, seeking to cover up their economic, social and environmental impact, and avoiding clear, informed debate.
This approach, which is for the profit of big business, is damaging to the needs of the peoples and workers, as well as being disadvantageous for the industries of the EU countries with the weakest economies.
As such, our only option is to condemn and stridently oppose it.
<D>
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - Mr President, it gives me the greatest of pleasure to welcome every word that the Commissioner spoke this evening and also to congratulate Mrs Thomsen, who has done a wonderful job as rapporteur on this most important subject.
It is a delight for me on the centre-right of the Chamber to be applauding a Socialist from the other side and from another country than my own and to wish her well because she has balanced the whole approach; she has highlighted the most important factors relating to the fact that ladies come to their teenage years ahead of males.
They are more intelligent; they are more hard-working; they can apply themselves and yet, even when they go into higher education, into the start of a research career, they sometimes fall away.
This is often because of pressures at home, in their personal lives.
Mrs Thomsen is right in her report and this evening to concentrate and focus on those problems.
The report has constructive ideas.
The only thing I hold back from is setting specific objectives for the percentage of women that should reach this grade or that grade or that position or another position.
That is too prescriptive.
But, on the other hand, this report has my total support.
I was honoured to produce the opinion from the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy.
I thank those shadow rapporteurs on the main report and on my opinion for their full cooperation.
This is an example of a piece of legislation and a report here in the European Parliament ensuring that we are seen at our best, in cooperation, focusing on the needs of the research industry.
I close by saying that last Thursday evening I went with one of my colleagues, Lambert van Nistelrooij from Holland, to Oxford University.
All of the scientists, the researchers, there were female.
I greatly welcome that.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, let me start by responding to Ms Thyssen on what we are doing to enhance our positive influence on the Chinese market.
If we are to achieve success, Europe should develop its role as a standard-bearer, and that is exactly what we are trying to do.
RAPEX-China gives the Chinese authorities access to details of risks found in Chinese products sold in Europe, and this is a very valuable source of information for them.
China is currently setting up its own national rapid-warning system, copying the European one.
This really represents a great success for product safety at world level.
It ensures that information is spread swiftly to local offices for action, and this should start by the end of the year.
If this continues to develop as envisaged, Europe will be able to congratulate itself, by the end of the year, on a major success, as it has established the pattern for the Chinese authorities.
I would like also to highlight that next year will be a very intensive one for me in respect of elaborating a new memorandum of understanding with China, owing to the fact that the current memorandum, which has been in effect since 2006, will expire at the beginning of 2009.
This will be a matter for very concrete work by the Commission.
Many of you have referred to the Toys Directive.
I cannot comment on something which comes under the responsibility of Vice-President Verheugen, as the Toys Directive is part of his portfolio, although we enjoy excellent cooperation.
However, you should be aware that a revision of the Toys Directive is in the pipeline and will be presented very soon.
Before my meeting with you, I checked with the services of Commissioner Verheugen, and with him in person, and know that this directive will soon be discussed by the Commission.
I am sure that his services are working flat out.
There is no mixing of our two approaches - the industry approach, which includes the Toys Directive and the approach on which I base my activities, which includes a general product safety directive.
I can assure you that the distinction within the Commission is really very clear.
That is exactly what we are trying to do through the new approach - to keep these two sets of checks parallel to each other.
One set concerns requirements on toys as industrial goods, and the other one, over and above those efforts, concerns checks at any given point on how safe the toys are for our children.
One good example is the magnets used in toys.
These now come under the General Product Safety Directive, and we are able to carry out checks, ban dangerous products and ask for a new standard, with the toys in the mean time being covered by a warning, and then we will come up with a proposal.
There will most probably be standardisation, and a ban on certain uses for magnets.
This approach is based precisely on filling the gap on safety, through a true General Product Safety Directive.
This is an excellent example of why we need to keep the two approaches together.
I started to respond to Ms Rühle concerning magnets.
The College will consider my proposal to adopt a targeted measure to require specific warnings on magnetic toys, and this would fill the gap until the relevant standards properly address this risk.
As you know, this process is a little long, but that is not up to the Commission.
This is legislation which we are simply executing concerning the way we implement on our standards.
I would like to dwell for a second on the opinion expressed by Mr Matsakis.
My line is quite simple, because I believe that Mr Harbour answered in a very consistent manner.
I do not think that dangerous toys have a passport, and we should address the danger from wherever the danger comes.
Let me just remind you that although 50% of the dangerous toys in Europe come from China, I am surprised that we have not discussed at all where the other 50% comes from.
I have to tell you that 30% of dangerous toys come precisely from Europe.
That is why I really insist on safety, regardless of passports.
We must consider again how important confidence is to our markets.
I am not going to outsource that responsibility.
Article 1 of the General Product Safety Directive states that all producers should only produce safe goods, and that whoever places a good on the market for the first time - be it the importer, the retailer or the producer - should check the safety of toys, for which he is liable.
With reference to Ms Iotova, I would like to answer in Bulgarian because it was in that language that she put her question.
(BG) My answer was very specific according to the standards of the Commission.
What we have done over the last year is intended to improve legislation.
Yes, part of this legislation relates to industrial goods and it is within the portfolio of another Commissioner but we work together on a number of issues.
Some of the questions asked relate also to the REACH Directive that is not in my portfolio either but, again, we are doing what is necessary to ensure the safety on the basis of the existing legislation.
Many meetings have been held with all stakeholders in the process - manufacturers, competent national authorities, retailers, and numerous non-governmental organisations.
Besides, I would like to tell you that we make no judgments and do not divide countries into old and new Member States.
The safety of goods is equally important for new and old members alike.
I would like to reassure you that there are some old Member States, prior to the accession of the twelve new countries, which have their serious problems and I have no intention to abandon them.
Of course, the responsibility of the Commission with regard to the implementation of the legislation, especially in the new Member States, is something which, undoubtedly, stands very close to my heart.
Therefore what I am doing in the new Member States is talk more to the authorities, insist more on a national budget for the development of market surveillance authorities.
I can tell you, Mme Iotova, that the Bulgarian market has 180 inspectors.
Yeasterday, actually it was earlier this morning, I had further talks with all participants in the safety chain and we concluded "the Christmas Pact”, involving manufacturers at the European level, as well as traders and government authorities in Bulgaria.
After the insistent talks I had with the Ministry of the Economy in Bulgaria, inspections increased four times.
Therefore I shall continue to work along these lines and, as I had the pleasure of doing it last time, I would like to renew my invitation from this plenary hall to do it together.
I am confident that we shall be more successful in this way.
I would like to end where I started, which is to say that all our actions should be proportional and based on solidarity and subsidiarity, which will give us additional strength to tackle this very important problem.
I have listened carefully to all of you, to your kind words and to your calls to step up our work.
If at any point there are specific cases which you would like to discuss with me, I would be more than happy to continue doing this.
<D>
President of the European Commission. - The Member States unanimously agreed that Gaddafi should go.
There is no contradiction in engaging in dialogue with the people we think we should talk to.
That was probably what Lady Ashton was referring to.
For instance, we have received here representatives of the opposition to Colonel Gaddafi.
Having said that, the military action was not a decision of the European Union as such.
Some Member States on the United Nations Security Council decided, based on a consensus reached in the European Council, to implement a no-fly zone.
But it was not a decision of the European Union as such because there were some differences in the approach to the situation.
We have to recognise this.
The reality is that there were differences over the way in which we should handle the Libyan issue.
However, I also agree with what President Van Rompuy said: without this position taken by the European Council, the decisions of the Security Council could not have been made.
These were historic decisions in the sense that they implement the responsibility to protect.
<D>
(PL) Maritime transport and ports and shipyards are rather forgotten sectors, although they have considerable growth potential.
A suitable conception is required for the development of competitive and safe maritime transport, ports and related sectors that would guarantee a high level of maritime safety.
Haulage by sea is a far more energy-efficient means of transport than road haulage.
Let us therefore give shipyards a chance to develop, including those in Gdynia, Gdańsk and Szczecin.
Let us remember that 90% of the EU's external trade and almost 40% of its internal trade passes through ports.
Europe has been linked to the sea since the dawn of its existence.
It had to be that way, since our coastline is 70 000 kilometres long, or three times the length of Africa's coastline.
For years the sea provided for our forefathers and was a source of considerable income.
The situation remains the same today.
Only an integrated and coordinated approach and appropriate action will enable us to benefit from the potential that our seas have to offer.
<D>
Ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the resolution on the situation in Georgia.
I did so not because this is an ideal resolution; there is no doubt in my mind that our resolution could be better.
I wavered on whether to support the draft resolution.
My doubts were stirred up by Mr Schulz just before the vote.
He expressed his regret that the resolution failed to criticise the Georgian President.
This remarkable statement convinced me that the resolution could have been a lot worse and could have been wrecked by the pro-Russian lobby in the European Parliament.
In what he said, Mr Schulz underestimated Parliament's unity over the crisis in the Caucasus.
It is now clear that it would have been better if the European Parliament had held an extraordinary session earlier on the subject of Georgia.
It is a shame that we did not present our position during a Council sitting.
It is a shame that we did not put forward our prescriptions and our views before the leaders of the Member States got together.
<D>
in writing. - In recent years, general and business aviation has been the fastest growing branch of the aviation sector.
Airports in my constituency of North-East England, such as Newcastle and Durham Tees Valley, are popular with amateur pilots and, increasingly, business people.
It is therefore a sub-sector that needs support and sensible regulation.
I am impressed with the Commission's commitment to proportionality in the regulation of general and business aviation.
This approach marks a significant departure from many previous transport-related proposals and is to be welcomed, although we must remain vigilant to ensure that the sector can continue to grow in a sustainable way without the kind of onerous red tape that, far too often, has characterised the Commission's proposals.
Inevitably, this sector will decline somewhat in the short term as the economic crisis continues to set in.
However, general and business aviation contributes significantly to economic growth, especially at a regional level as we in north-east England can attest.
I voted in favour of this report.
<D>
in writing. - (NL) The large majority of all nations in the former Yugoslavia wish to join the EU.
This wish has been expressed not only by the Albanians and Macedonians in Macedonia, who only recently found a solution to their differences of opinion regarding the government of that country, but also by the Serbs, Montenegrins and Albanian Kosovars, who recently bade farewell to a common state, along with the Serbs, Croats and Bosnians in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
The EU would do well not to overestimate the significance of this.
The fact that they wish to work together within the EU says nothing at all about the state structure where they live.
This is in the hands of the people themselves, not the EU.
If they have to choose between regional self-governance and a transfer of powers to a central government, because that is what the EU wants, then they will opt for the former.
The war in Bosnia between 1992 and 1995 came about because the majority of residents did not want a central government, but a loose partnership at most.
Yesterday's debate clearly demonstrated that a large majority of this Parliament would opt for more central government in Bosnia-Herzegovina rather than decentralisation.
Since this goal is unattainable, the EU condemns itself to an indefinite presence in that country.
This is why I will be voting against.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - I am glad to hear in the discussion confirmation of the Commission's objectives in this exercise to bring the EGF into the next financial perspective as a stronger and more effective instrument to support workers who have been made redundant.
This case is also supported by the fact that, in the near future, fiscal consolidation will remain on the agenda in most of the Member States, and they will find it extremely helpful if there is a strong, quick and effective EU-level instrument to support workers who suddenly find themselves out of a job.
As I pointed out, some questions remain open, such as the relationship between the EGF and the ESF.
As you know, the ESF is implemented through shared management, and I believe that the management system of the current ESF is not compatible with the objectives of the EGF.
No matter what eventual format we find, I think this question of management will be very important in influencing the final arrangements.
I am not speaking about names, but about the need for a separate fund and the need to pay attention to speed in particular.
Of course, even now, and probably also in the future, various Member States will find it possible to fund programmes either from the EGF or the ESF and have some kind of room for manoeuvre, but it is very important just to keep the EGF available for all Member States in case there is a need to respond to sudden employment crises.
The second question pointed to the problem of defining eligibility in the current regulation.
This is also an issue we are looking at in order to have a greater level of clarity, but at the moment, we are simply working on extending the temporary regulation until the end of this financial perspective.
I am speaking here about the rules which have been introduced in response to the crisis and to make the EGF more effective in tackling the impact of the crisis on workers.
<D>
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the lively debates that we have had recently about energy show that energy is a valuable asset, a basic need.
Well, what about water?
This is even more precious.
We are conscious of the scarcity of water in developing countries.
Well, what about in Europe?
Water is also a valuable resource for Europe.
Let us stop wasting it; let us conserve this resource.
The report that will be put to the vote tomorrow is a comprehensive report that deals with technical aspects, such as leakage from distribution networks, as well as political and societal aspects, such as usage and raising awareness about the efficient use of water.
Our responsibility for water is both individual and collective.
This report also addresses the issue of problems arising from the scarcity of water and drought, problems that are both immediate and long term in the context of climate change.
I would like to point out that it is important to share good practices, since Europe is affected to varying degrees by the scarcity of water, or drought, and therefore the practical experience of all regions is crucial if we are to avoid these phenomena or resolve them.
I will even go further by saying that lessons can be learnt from both good and bad practices.
I am also satisfied that a link has been made between the availability of water and the quality of water.
In fact, Parliament attaches a great deal of importance to this issue of water quality, through texts such as environmental quality standards or the current debate on pesticides.
The solution to the scarcity of this resource has many different angles: we need to encourage research and innovation, we need to improve technical and agricultural use, we need to change individual behaviours.
Let us act now and disprove the old English adage that 'you never miss the water till the well runs dry'.

(FI) Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs, the compromise achieved in the Gas Directive is good and we can support it.
However, not enough attention has been paid to customers and consumers, who are in a weak position; this applies to the poor and to those living in remote areas.
I therefore ask you to support our proposed amendments.
Secondly, it is good that a compromise has been reached with the Council, ensuring that the countries from which there is no pipeline to the other EU Member States will not end up implementing all the internal market rules because they are not participating in the internal markets.
A strategic energy technology programme really is needed, and I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on the fact that energy efficiency has been included.
There has been inadequate funding for energy technology.
This has led to supply and demand failing to coincide.
The crisis that has occurred in all sectors of the energy industry has led to the industry, which has woken up to climate change, not obtaining the technology it needs quickly enough.
Quite simply, there are not enough suppliers of components.
Waking up to the reality of climate change has shown how poorly prepared for it we are.
However, the change in the attitudes of citizens is clear, and cooperation is now needed from the Community, the Union, its Member States and industry at the same time as we have to prevent developing economies from spoiling our living conditions by polluting them.
We must improve cooperation with the United States in the field of the environment and at the same time we must conclude an energy cooperation agreement with Russia.
It is therefore important to consider consumers, industrial development and cooperation with the United States and Russia.

Following a delay of almost six years, the EU is today close to adopting a nuclear safety directive, an important political document for nuclear energy in Europe, which is used to produce almost one third of the EU's electricity.
Member States have the exclusive right to decide themselves whether to rely on nuclear energy.
For countries both accepting and rejecting this form of energy, it is just as important that the highest safety standards in nuclear energy apply.
I welcome the inclusion of the IAEA's basic safety principles as an annex to the directive.
This will ensure that the best developments in nuclear safety standards become an integral part of European legislation, which Member States are accordingly bound to comply with.
The lack of generally approved nuclear safety requirements in the EU allowed, in the not too distant past, some of the countries joining the EU to have political solutions imposed on their nuclear energy, which are not in line nowadays with the EU's objectives for limiting climate change and for energy supply security.
At a time when a number of new nuclear power plants are under construction in the EU or in the pipeline, the timely adoption of the nuclear safety directive is not only justified, but is mandatory because of the guarantees it offers for the population's safety and peace of mind.

(PL) Mr President, I regret to inform you that the rights of people who leave the Catholic Church in Poland are being broken.
Against the will of the apostates, their personal details are not removed from parish archives.
On the contrary, they continue to be used.
This is the instruction concerning the protection of personal data in the activity of the Catholic Church in Poland.
The part of the instruction we are talking about is not based on the prevailing Personal Data Protection Act, but - and listen carefully - on the provisions of the Code of Canon Law.
How is it that in Poland, which claims to uphold the rule of law, canon law has precedence over law made by the national Parliament?
Why does the Code of Canon Law govern the rights of citizens who are not Catholics?
How is it possible that the Inspector General for Personal Data Protection does not have any authority to inspect church archives?
There is only one explanation: Poland is a church state.
The European Parliament should react to this.
<D>
The next item is Question Time (B7-0009/2011).
The following questions are addressed to the Commission.
Subject: Marketing ban on the drug 'Médiator'
Can the Commission explain why a decision was not taken in 1998 to ban the marketing of pharmaceuticals containing benfluorex?
Should the Commission not have been alerted, and not for the first time, by the bans imposed by the authorities in Spain and Italy?
Why, ultimately, did the Commission not act until as late as June 2010, when it finally took a clear decision on the marketing of that molecule?
Will the Commission ask the European Medicines Agency to conduct a full retrospective investigation into the ways in which this drug was used over twenty years?
<D>
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FI) Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and levels of cooperation, and, in particular, for highlighting the way men and women are treated differently, despite the fact that we hardly ever get a sympathetic hearing.
The Member of the Commission is, I am sure, personally committed to the issue, but when I was listening to your official reply in which you said that the Roadmap had been adopted, and that there was commitment to it, afterwards one might naturally have expected to hear an account of what had actually happened.
Unfortunately, we have to say that hardly anything has happened in matters of equality during this Commission's term.
That is regrettable.
It is perhaps not the sort of important issue the Commissioners or others could score points on; nevertheless, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to encourage us all to do more because we are responsible for the status of women in Europe.
I will give you one example.
In Finland women got the right to vote when it was part of a very conservative Russia in 1905.
That was amazing.
Looking ahead now, I do not think it will be possible, now we are part of Europe, for women in the different Member States to earn the same pay and receive the same kind of treatment in the EU, even if the EU speaks of human rights and is progressive.
I think the EU could take a look at the decisions that were taken in tsarist times and make bold decisions on equality of pay and equality in the workplace.
The tsar had the courage to give women the vote, but the EU does not have the courage to do anything to bring about equality of pay in the Member States of the EU.
<D>
Vice-President of the Commission. - Firstly, about bureaucracy and the administrative burden: they exist, no doubt.
As I said, my colleague Mr Špidla is responsible for spending the money, and I am responsible for discharge: ensuring that no money is wasted.
This is always a dilemma.
We try to be as flexible as possible but, at the same time, the benefits and possible outcomes are also carefully audited by national authorities, by paying agencies and probably by the ministry responsible.
This also includes the European Court of Auditors and our DG, so there are different layers of control as well.
The result is assessed by large public participation, and projects must be seen, so now we have an obligation to have everything published on the website about the financing so that everyone can follow it.
The Social Fund, however, is mainly financing training.
In response to the next question: there is cooperation between different sources of financing structural funds, including the Social Fund and regional development funds and, in my country at least, they are in very close cooperation with each other.
This cooperation depends on national authorities.
We can only support good cooperation and the efficient use of money.
Part II
Subject: Community co-financed projects and Siemens' slush funds
The Greek and German judicial authorities are continuing to investigate the case of the Siemens' slush funds, which were used by the firm to bribe political parties and persons in authority in order to obtain major public sector works and supply contracts.
The German courts have already convicted a former senior executive of the company, who has admitted that slush funds also existed in Greece.
Given that these bribes may well relate to Community co-funded projects, will the Commission say whether OLAF or any other of its services is investigating the legality of the award procedures and implementation of such projects?
<D>
(PL) Mr President, I voted in favour of this report for a number of reasons.
Firstly, one of the main challenges with which Europe has to contend is climate change.
This also has a direct bearing on maritime areas, especially coastal regions threatened by rising water levels.
Secondly, significant exploitation of maritime resources, especially through excessive fishing, as well as climate change, currently constitutes a serious threat to the marine environment.
Relations between oceans and the climate are treated as a major part of EU climate policy.
Thirdly, almost 80% of pollution of the marine environment originates from the land.
Environmental threats such as shipwrecks on the sea bed and the remains of military ammunition and chemical weaponry are also of considerable significance.
Fourthly, intensive fishing has rocked the equilibrium of the ecosystem and is destabilising biodiversity too.
Fifthly, oceans and seas play an important role in the European strategy to ensure energy security.
On the one hand, they are a source of oil and gas, as well as a source of renewable energy.
On the other, they constitute a means and a route for the transportation of energy and thus increase energy security.
We therefore need to create a sustainable policy for development of the seas and oceans.
Written explanation of vote
<D>
Mr President, I greet you on behalf of a small American republic, in which just over 4.5 million people dare every day to live and to dream; in which the ideal of a society without an army has been possible, and in which we will soon be celebrating 110 years of democracy.
I greet you on behalf of a small American republic that during the second half of the 20th century was surrounded by the most appalling dictatorships, whilst never experiencing oppression itself; which refused to be a pawn in the Cold War, and has refrained from using arms to achieve peace.
I greet you on behalf of the Republic of Costa Rica.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen:
Two events have preceded me today, separated by centuries and decades, but they are as connected with the present as this morning's dawn.
This very day, 225 years ago, the US War of Independence came to an end with the signing of the Treaty of Paris, the first wave of the independence movement across practically the whole of the American continent.
Also 69 years ago today, the Second World War began, with the declaration of war on Germany by France and the United Kingdom, and the emergence of the Allies, which included a large part of America.
I am mentioning these events because as I come to this podium, a symbol of communion between different peoples, I do so with an awareness of the historical baggage I carry on my shoulders and which you also carry in the pasts of each of the nations that you represent.
We have not come here to establish relations between our two continents, but to recognise that these relations have existed for a long time, and that any attempt to improve them should start with an attempt to understand them as a whole.
With the frankness that should prevail among friends, we have to recognise that our common history has its origin in the domination of one civilisation by another.
America came to know Europe first of all through its power rather than through its ideas.
Fear characterised the conquest, and indignation characterised colonisation.
Nevertheless, we cannot fail to admire this age-old culture.
Despite the battles that we have fought, it is undeniable that Europe turned on the light of reason in our land, and that it instilled in us an attachment to the best causes of humanity, causes that we did not abandon when we gained independence.
These were the causes that brought me to Europe 21 years ago, during my first administration as President of Costa Rica.
At that time I came to ask for the strength of this continent to help in the quest for peace in Central America, where five nations were fighting for their lives in the midst of civil war.
Bloodshed was dividing our peoples and pitting brother against brother.
In a cruel experiment, the powers of the time used us as a testing ground to demonstrate their might: they brought in the weapons and we suffered the deaths.
The number of fatalities rose, according to some estimates, to 350 000 people.
On a proportional basis, this equates to nearly 4 million US citizens dying in the Iraq war.
It was only by achieving peace that we could guarantee a future for our region.
At that time, Europe was the answer to our prayers.
The moral support of this continent legitimised our efforts to find a diplomatic solution to the conflicts, a Central American solution to Central American problems.
The international aid that you provided us with at that time was extensive and generous, and it was a symbol of Europe's genuine desire to help with the progress of the Central American nations.
Now, 21 years later, I am returning to Europe, and like Fray Luis de León when he came out of four years in prison, I feel compelled to start with 'As we were saying yesterday...', because in many respects we need to pick up where we left off.
Relations between Europe and Central America, so close in a time of war, have become distant in a time of peace.
Aid from Europe for Central America, which was so great in a time of oppression, has become more moderate in a time of freedom.
We never imagined that in crossing the threshold of peace, we would enter the kingdom of oblivion.
I would like to think that this is the time to show that the friends who supported us in our darkest days will also be able to do so in our brighter days, precisely because we are now experiencing brighter days.
Today I would like to propose three courses of action, through which we could strengthen our ties and fight, shoulder to shoulder, to build the utopias that you yourselves taught us to pursue: the signing of the EU-Central America Association agreement, the Consensus of Costa Rica and 'Peace with Nature'.
I am well aware that in this House there are all kinds of views regarding free trade.
However, I also know that those views are expressed from the high-altitude perspective of those who have the good fortune to live in a developed nation.
Today I would like to give you the perspective from down on the plains.
For a country like mine, one of the smallest in the world, it is not possible to produce everything that we consume.
We are doomed to be the Phoenicians of the modern age.
In an era of globalisation, the dilemma that developing nations face is as harsh as it is simple: if we cannot export more and more goods and services, we will end up exporting more and more people.
It is clear that Europe needs to look after the interests of the European people.
It is also clear, however, that the interests of the European people, and of any race in the world, are increasingly determined by the common destiny of humanity.
No nation can carry on regardless while beyond its borders hunger, ignorance, violence and disease are rife.
While the disparities between our nations remain so great, a global diaspora will continue to take thousands of human beings over oceans, rivers and city walls to seek the opportunities that they have been unable to find in their own countries.
The Association Agreement between Central America and the European Union, which may be the first agreement between regions that the European Union concludes, is the closest, clearest and most immediate opportunity that Europe has to revitalise its presence in Latin America.
Since the creation of the Central American Common Market, few initiatives have held greater potential for accelerating economic growth in the Central American isthmus, to modernise our institutions and provide new opportunities for those Central Americans who are still living in poverty.
For Europe, reaching this agreement would mean taking up the position of leadership that it has lost, and occupying the vacant position at the forefront of the battle for the development of our Latin America.
Yesterday we were allies for peace, today we can be partners in development.
However, Central America and Europe still have colossal differences, which have to be considered.
The first is the difference between our two models of integration: Europe must accept that Central American integration has happened in the manner that our institutional development has allowed.
We are now the most integrated region in the developing world, and we therefore think that it is not fair for conditions to be imposed on us in terms of our integration in order to advance the negotiations; conditions that it is difficult for Central America to comply with, and that, moreover, are not required of other regions of the world.
The second difference between our regions, and perhaps the most important one, is the difference between our levels of development: it is crucial that the commercial component of the agreement gives asymmetrical treatment in favour of Central America, and above all that it avoids the terrible practice of retaining the barriers in the areas where it is precisely Central America that has the comparative advantages.
If we reach an agreement on the basis of these assumptions, Europe would be making a giant leap to benefit the people of Central America, but also of Europe, because in times of international crisis, Europe could benefit greatly from an economy that has been growing at approximately twice the rate of the European economy over the last five years.
Europe can begin to play a new leading role in the developing world, but first it needs to ensure that this leading role will indeed benefit development.
Goethe said that 'nothing is more damaging to a new truth than an old error'.
We cannot enter a new phase of international cooperation while carrying the burdens of the past, particularly the burden of a military expenditure that is in itself truly offensive to the nearly 200 million Latin American people who are languishing in poverty.
The time has come for the international financial community to learn to separate the wheat from the chaff, and to recognise, with the evidence before it, what expenditure translates into a better standard of living for human beings, and what does not.
It is not a badge of honour that in 2007 Latin America's military expenditure amounted to 36 billion dollars, in a region that, with the sole exception of Colombia, is not currently experiencing any armed conflict.
The money that is spent on a single Sukhoi Su-30k aeroplane could buy around 200 000 MIT Media Lab XO laptops for our students.
The money spent on a single Black Hawk helicopter could pay a grant of 100 dollars per month to 5 000 Latin American young people.
The developed nations of the world must not support, with aid and resources, the decision of those who prefer to equip their soldiers rather than educate their children.
That is why, ladies and gentlemen, my Government has announced the Consensus of Costa Rica, an initiative to create mechanisms for forgiving debt and supporting, with financial resources, developing countries which invest more in environmental protection, education, health and housing for their peoples and less on arms and soldiers.
I still hope that the Consensus of Costa Rica, with your support, will one day become a reality.
I also hope that we will be able to adopt a plan that is closely connected with the Consensus: the Treaty on the Transfer of Arms that Costa Rica has proposed in the United Nations, which bans countries from transferring arms to States, groups or individuals if there is sufficient reason to believe that those arms will be used to violate human rights or international law.
I do not know how much longer we will be able to survive without realising that killing many people, little by little, every day, is just as reprehensible as killing many people in one day.
The destructive power of the 640 million small and light arms that there are in the world, 74% of which are in the hands of civilians, has proven to be more lethal than that of nuclear bombs, and it constitutes one of the main driving forces behind public insecurity both nationally and internationally.
The fear of death must not be the key in which the future of our people is written.
Today we can do something to ensure that this is not the case.
There is just one more thing that I would like to mention, and it is something that also has to do with violence and destruction, but not only against human beings, but against all forms of life.
Every forest that we cut down, every tonne of carbon dioxide that we emit into the air, every river that we pollute, bring us one step closer to the gateway to the extinction of our species, on the threshold of which, as at the gates to Dante's hell, we will have to abandon all hope.
I refuse to witness humanity going through that gateway.
Sixty years ago the former President of Costa Rica, José Figueres, had the vision of abolishing the national army and thus declaring peace to the world.
We have now taken the decision to declare 'Peace with Nature'.
We have set out to be a carbon neutral country by 2021, when we will celebrate 200 years of independence.
Last year we became the country with the most trees per capita and per square kilometre in the world, by planting 5 million trees.
In 2008 we will plant 7 million more trees.
We are leading an international crusade against global warming, and today I humbly ask you to join us in it.
Global warming has made it possible for olive trees to grow on the coasts of England, which is a truly alarming sign to the scientific community.
Unlike in the Bible story, this time the dove will not bring an olive branch as a sign of peace, but as a sign of danger.
Today I ask for us to send that dove to the farthest corner of the world, so that it may return carrying the will to change of all the nations of the world.
It is only together that we will be able to form a new alliance, this time not between God and man, but between man and God's creation.
Mr President:
The great Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges used to say that he was an exiled European, alluding to the European ancestry of a large proportion of the population of our American continent.
After centuries of intermingling and interchanging of races, there are probably also many exiled Americans here.
We were exiled by the geographical chance of an ocean, and the historical chance of a pendulum that brings us together and distances us according to circumstances.
I believe it is time to leave the pendulum set at union, to take the path once again that the winds took 180 million years ago, before the first crack appeared on earth, when Europe was joined to America, and it would have been possible to walk from Paris to New York.
We are all members of a single species, which is still capable of plucking the best flowers from the garden of life.
Our dreams are a common heritage and our decisions have an impact on the lives of others, whether we like it or not.
I think that this is far from a threat, but rather that it is undoubtedly a wonderful opportunity.
I think, as the greatest Costa Rican poet, Jorge Debravo, said, 'it is wonderful, above all, to know that we have the power to bring to life the most remote things that we touch, to expand our horizons and not see any edges, because all the things that we see become, along with us, infinite'.
I have no doubt that we will be able to use this infinite power for the good of everyone, both Europeans and Americans, and that side by side we will follow the star of a tomorrow of greater justice and freedom.
(Standing ovation)

The citizens' initiative was promised in the Treaty of Lisbon and is now finally being implemented.
This new form of participation in the formulation of European Union policy allows European citizens to directly approach the Commission asking it to table a proposal on matters of interest to them, provided these fall within the framework of the EU's powers.
We were only waiting for rules of procedure to be introduced for this new European citizens' right to become a reality.
This has now been done and I supported the proposal in the vote.
A 'citizens' committee' made up of individuals from at least seven Member States can register an initiative with the Commission.
After this, the process to gather signatures on paper or online can begin.
The million signatures that are required must come from at least one quarter of the EU Member States and must be gathered within 12 months.
Member States will verify the statements of support.
All the signatures must be submitted by European Union citizens old enough to vote in the European parliamentary elections.
Lastly, the Commission, as guardian of the treaties, will be the final judge of whether the proposed legislative procedure should be undertaken.
<D>
I voted against this report which, once again, shows how the majorities that govern Europe are incapable of listening to the demands of European citizens.
Although, on these matters, the European Union has no competence over the exclusive competencies of Member States, Mr Mann shatters both the social achievements gained and the principle of subsidiarity.
Among other things, the report encourages Member States to promote working beyond the legal retirement age and wants Member States to provide incentives to the over-60s to remain in work longer through the adaptation of work places to their health status.
Above all, elderly people must be entitled to a decent pension, enabling them to live life with dignity.
Furthermore, it is mainly early retirement schemes that are used to make arrangements to meet the needs of workers nearing the end of their career and yet, quite simply, Mr Mann wants to dismantle them.
Nevertheless, I welcome the fact that the European Parliament has rejected one passage explicitly calling for the replacement of the pay-as-you-go system with capital-funded systems.
Under the guise of intergenerational solidarity, Mr Mann even feels the need to remind us that older people must be treated equally as human beings with fundamental rights.
Point duly made.
(The explanation of vote was cut short pursuant to Rule 170 of the Rules of Procedure)
<D>
The right of workers to rest and a holiday has been turned into a commodity to enrich capital.
The purpose of timeshares and the new products being promoted within these frameworks is to exploit perpetual cutbacks in holiday time, shrinking incomes and workers' efforts to secure cheaper holidays in the long term, creating turnover which exceeds EUR 11 billion.
The trickery and aggressive methods used by what are often phantom companies to persuade and dupe buyers range, in the best case scenario, from the small print in contracts to misleading advertising, tiresome presentations, promises of gifts and so forth, and almost always end in the immediate signature, under pressure, of binding documents.
The complaints which reach consumer organisations about fraud, excessive maintenance charges, associated credit cards, huge drops in price on resale due to marketing expenses, and so on, are countless.
The inclusion of other products in the timeshare directive, such as holidays on ships or in clubs or caravans, guarantees legal cover and new sources of profit for capital.
The cooling off period, which is limited to 10 days and carries a fine in the order of 3% of the total amount, does not resolve the problem.
On the contrary, the ΕU is shifting the burden of responsibility to the workers, as it does with all consumer products.
<D>
I come from an outermost region, the Azores, where milk production is the pillar of the economy, society and the environment.
In recent weeks we met with the producers, their organisations and the processing industries.
They all agree.
It is crucial that the Commission should give a more effective and urgent global response in order to tackle the current situation.
Cash flow in the sector is drying up.
It is vital that the outermost regions be looked at particularly carefully by the EU and be included in its responses to mitigate the effects of the current crisis.
They are all of the opinion that we need to stop the increase in quotas.
In a market thrown off balance by surpluses, any country that increases its production harms all the others.
They also believe that we should continue to maintain quotas as a supply regulation mechanism that stabilises their activity.
In the current scenario of total liberalisation, its social, environmental and economic effects on these regions need to be urgently studied.
Specific measures must be designed to prevent the collapse of this activity, which is responsible for our beautiful countryside, the quality of our environment and rural areas, and the economic progress and convergence that we have been achieving.
<D>
(SL) Thank you, Mr Medina Ortega, for your supplementary question.
As has already been mentioned, the Council has not yet had a discussion at the highest level and has not made a comprehensive assessment of the effects of the expansion of the Schengen area on individual countries.
You asked about the Slovenian experience and I will say this: it is most certainly not a question of building new walls, but of shifting the European Union's external borders to new borders.
It means that the external borders of the Schengen area have moved to incorporate a larger number of European Union Member States.
It was a demanding project for the States whose borders are now partly new external borders of the Schengen area.
They spent many years preparing for it.
This project was very challenging and the European Union recognised it by setting up a special source of financing called the 'Schengen Facility', which helped to establish appropriate controls at the new external borders of the Schengen area.
You also asked about the border between Slovenia and Croatia.
It is a fact that this was an invisible border in the past.
It is also a fact that it was a provisional border at the time we gained independence.
In cooperation with our partners in the European Union, we actually managed to organise border controls that do not make it more difficult for citizens of the Republic of Croatia to cross.
We also managed to preserve all the elements required by the Schengen standards and regulations for effective border controls.
<D>
Madam President, the political crisis in Madagascar has led to an unconstitutional change of government.
This was accompanied by unrest, in which over 130 people lost their lives.
Madagascar was under French rule until 1960.
It is a country in a difficult situation.
It is in need of humanitarian aid, and especially food aid, and this help has been given to Madagascar.
The authorities and successive elections which they organised were supported by the army.
President Ravalomanana lost support, and he stood down on 17 March 2009.
Power was seized by Rajoelina, who was designated by the army.
The European Union does not recognise the new government because of the undemocratic way in which this change was made.
The African Union has suspended Madagascar from membership, and is critical of the removal of Ravalomanana by force.
It has threatened to impose sanctions if constitutional order is not restored within six months.
We call for restoration of constitutional order in Madagascar.
We appeal to the international community to support efforts to restore the legal basis of the function of this state.
I think that the electoral process should be closely monitored and observed by representatives of international organisations, including in particular Members of our Parliament.
<D>
(HU) Thank you, Mr President.
We are all committed to stopping climate change, to preventing the global environmental catastrophe that threatens humanity.
We know, of course, that this entails serious costs, which we citizens will sooner or later have to pay for one way or another.
We also know that the later we take action, the greater will be the damage, the more irreversible the processes, and the more we will have to pay.
The question is whether, on the one hand, we are brave enough to be the first to take action and make the necessary sacrifices, and on the other hand, how we will share the burden among the various social and economic actors.
The legislative package before us shows that the European Union is committed to action, and it also demonstrates that, unfortunately, it is partisan, inconsistent and uses a double standard when it comes to implementation.
It allows certain Member States to produce more emissions in 2020 than the Kyoto target set for 2010.
Meanwhile others, who had already been performing well, are not given adequate incentives.
Why do we turn a blind eye to the fact that certain Member States do not care a whit about their promises, while others agree to make enormous sacrifices?
It is likewise incomprehensible why the cement industry should have to reduce twice as much as the waste industry or transport.
Minister, the brave government is not one that dares to mete out harsh punishment to companies, but one that is just as severe toward itself.
The wise government is not one that takes citizens' money abroad under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), but one that invests at home, within the EU, reducing our energy dependency by creating new, marketable, clean technologies.
The present global economic recession is no reason for failing to take action, but on the contrary, it is an opportunity for a breakthrough.
Europe's historical responsibility and opportunity also means assuming a pioneering role in this third industrial revolution.
Thank you for your attention.
<D>
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Lenarčič, I am also speaking for the delegation; I am in fact chairwoman of the European Parliament delegation to the three Caucasus countries.
You are right to say that the situation is worrying and serious, and I do not think we can just stand by and watch this escalation in provocation.
Personally, I would say it almost amounted to the annexation of one country by another.
When Russia withdrew in March from the sanctions regime ordered by the CIS, it opened up for itself the possibility of giving military assistance to Abkhazia.
On 16 April, Russia legalised the bilateral relations and official documents of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.
Surely this means recognition, indirectly, of these two separatist regions?
Then of course, on 24 April, Russia unilaterally increased the number of troops and sent armed equipment.
We do not know.
Even the UN, in the country, does not know how much Russia has increased its peacekeeping forces.
As my colleagues have said, we were in Gali last week and apparently there was nothing that justified increasing these troops, up from 2 000 to 3 000 troops.
For any fellow Members who do not know, this agreement dates from 1994 when Russia put itself forward as a mediator and suggested sending peacekeeping forces on to Abkhazian territory, between the Abkhazian area and the area of Abkhazia where the Georgian populations were living.
Today, as the CIS talks about diversity, only Russian troops are present.
As a mediator ourselves we might ask the question: what kind of result has this mediation achieved?
I also want to ask what our responsibility is.
I have, of course, heard all your suggestions, but I think that at the moment we need to stop the escalation of violence.
I also heard the Council's last two statements.
The European Union is only supporting the restoration of trust.
Mr Lenarčič, there is no trust today in this area.
There is not even dialogue any more.
Abkhazia broke off its dialogue with Georgia in 2006.
As regards communication by the European Union, the Commission is also taking steps.
It is saying that the European Union will only get involved in this conflict if both parties present ask for it.
In response, I can say: that will never happen.
Russia will never ask us to help sort out the problem because Russia has always said it was not a stakeholder in this conflict.
Therefore, the issue of the European Union's responsibility now arises.
Though you also announce that there is UN support, we know very well that there is complete deadlock at the UN, and failure too, because when there was a call for a UN resolution, Russia did not respond.
Russia is therefore also stalling this process.
I believe that with this we have enough arguments, as well as the possibility of helping in a much more concrete way.
This is no longer a question of conflict resolution; we are clearly at the stage of preventing a possible conflict.
We therefore need to act, and that is why, in the context of the resolution we voted for in Tbilisi last week, we are considering, for example, suggesting that Russia share the burden of peacekeeping by sending a civil peace corps over there.
I think we should remember the Balkans.
I think history will not forgive us for failing to act a second time.
The Balkan war should have been the last, and I think it is up to us to nip the conflict in the South Caucasus in the bud.
<D>
(FI) Mr President, I wish to thank my colleague, Mrs Grossetête, for her excellent report.
It is important to reform the laws on marketing authorisations because it will reduce the administrative burden that goes with processing them.
At the same time, too, it will allow the use of resources to be steered towards issues that are essential for drug safety and public health, which is also in the interests of patients needing medication.
After all, the main criterion is ultimately the interests of the patient.
I am in favour of a system where the same rules would apply both nationally and for authorisations granted in the context of EU processes.
At present, the rules on the issue of market authorisations are harmonised regardless of the issuing process that is applied to them, but that has not been the case with the changes to the marketing authorisation.
Accordingly, different Member States have been expecting partially different rules for such matters as the classification of the applications for amendments and in connection with the process for evaluating them.
It is important for the pharmaceutical industry that it will still be able, in future, to submit a complete, new application for a market authorisation for a drug that already has one, but which has another commercial name and a different summary of product characteristics.
This is necessary in situations where a marketing authorisation is being applied for in respect of medicinal products for a new purpose, and permitting a new name to be used is also clearer for the patient than using the same name when the drug is being used for very different purposes.
I therefore support Amendments 4 and 18, which deal with this.
As pharmaceutical companies often supply the entire EU with medicinal products, it is important that the administrative processes in different countries are harmonised.
Any other approach would mean not just a huge administrative burden for the industry, but often also logistical problems.
I hope that Parliament will support Mrs Grossetête's report in tomorrow's vote and that the Member States later on this year will also support Parliament's views, so that the reform of the laws on marketing authorisations can be brought to a conclusion by the end of this year.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - (EL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is my first official appearance before Parliament, so let me firstly express my thanks to its Members for placing their trust in me through their vote.
I repeat what I said at my hearing: I aim to cooperate with MEPs fruitfully and to the best of my ability.
Now, Mr President, to the subject of cancer:
In addition to the priority given to cancer by you and by the Slovenian Presidency, this issue has been a particular concern of mine for many years, so I am pleased that it is the first topic for me to address in front of the plenary.
Every year 3.2 million Europeans are diagnosed with cancer, but this burden is not spread equally across the Union.
For example, the most recent data shows that cervical cancer is over four times higher in Bulgaria than in Finland, and the risk of dying from cervical cancer is almost five times higher in Lithuania than in Italy.
These variations show that there is scope to do better across the Union.
Clearly, the primary responsibility for comprehensive cancer services lies with the Member States, but European action can make a difference.
The Commission is currently preparing a report on the implementation of the Council recommendation on cancer screening of 2003.
I expect that this will show that progress has been made, but that more still needs to be done.
We will work with the Member States to pursue this.
But even though screening is important, I think that Community action against cancer must cover a wider range of topics.
For example: health information and data on the cancer burden that will highlight inequalities and best practices across Europe; preventative measures and health promotion on topics such as tobacco, nutrition and alcohol; best practices on treatment and integrated cancer care, such as palliative care; bringing together expertise through European reference networks; providing investment in infrastructure through the Structural Funds; and support for cancer research at Community level.
I plan to bring forward proposals for an action plan on cancer next year.
This will aim to provide focus and coherence for all these actions.
We will also consider whether the scientific evidence justifies updating the existing recommendation on cancer screening.
Some actions are already under way.
We plan to include provisions for European reference networks as part of the forthcoming proposals on the application of patient rights in cross-border health care.
The proposals later this year on rare diseases will also help to improve, inter alia, the situation regarding rare types of cancer.
Moreover, when a person has cancer, it affects them most, but it also affects their family, their employer and society as a whole.
My proposals will be accompanied by an impact assessment that will make clear not just the human cost of cancer but also the wider social and economic costs.
I look forward to hearing your suggestions on issues we need to address as we develop those proposals.
You may be sure that your proposals will be taken into account as we develop this action plan, and I count on your support for all our future actions.
<D>
The principle of gender equality is not being pursued effectively.
According to Spanish Member Mrs Valenciano, cows are better protected in the EU than women.
We suffer discrimination in every area of life.
We earn 18% less than men, we are more often unemployed and we are underrepresented in politics, public life and business.
Most lamentable of all is the fact that women cannot benefit fully even from fundamental rights.
In relation to women, the right to life and personal integrity, as well as reproductive rights, are violated significantly more often.
For example, in Poland, the restriction of human rights is tolerated in relation to women.
In 1997, the President of the Constitutional Tribunal, in justifying rejection of liberalisation of the right to abortion, considered it obvious that a pregnant woman must be deprived of some of her civil rights.
Not only did this not end his career, but it strengthened his position as a 'moral authority'.
The gender question must find significant reflection in the Union budget.
The economic crisis must not be the cause of restrictions on measures for equality between men and women.
Only a consistent, long-term political strategy can bring results.
Just promoting equal treatment of the sexes and passing anti-discrimination laws is not enough.
Legislation does not automatically generate equality.
What is needed is work from the bottom up, building the social awareness and solidarity of women.
Improving the situation of women requires a fight against stereotypes and discriminatory practices and the elimination of male chauvinists from public life.
<D>
Let me make the following proposal, Mr Wurtz: I have already written to the President of Afghanistan about this matter, and if you are all in agreement, I shall take the initiative again, not just in my own name but on behalf of the whole House.
May I assume that this is what everyone wants?
In that case, we shall not immerse ourselves any further in this matter, Mr Cohn-Bendit, and I shall launch another initiative on behalf of you all.
I would really like to avoid a debate.
If Mr Schulz wishes to speak, Mr Cohn-Bendit is entitled to address us first.
Does Mr Cohn-Bendit wish to speak?
That is the proper procedure, but I shall not give anyone preferential treatment.
Mr Cohn-Bendit does not wish to make a statement.
What about Mr Schulz?
<D>
I welcome the fact that we can deem the 2011 budget the 'youth' budget.
As such, it contributes to the adoption of the proposals that we submitted to help young people, for example, in access to employment, as is also the case with the so-called Erasmus first job initiative.
Promoting entrepreneurship among young people, providing incentives and strengthening innovation and the digital agenda are other proposals that will contribute to sustainable economic development in Europe, and will result in the creation of new jobs.
With regard to Parliament's budget, it is worth noting that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) supports a budget that is both sustainable and rigorous, in which every expenditure item is justified.
We believe and recommend that Parliament should abandon a budgetary model that is purely incremental.
Instead, it should move towards a zero-based budget, which makes efficiency, and therefore savings, possible.
A long-term building policy needs to be set out as a matter of urgency in order to make this concept of sustainability, rigour and efficiency a reality.
We still need to find out more and more thoroughly about what our fixed expenditure is.
This must still be followed by a cost-benefit analysis of the various policies implemented.
We would stress once again that excellence in lawmaking should be Parliament's main priority, and that our institution must have at its disposal all the resources necessary for this to be achieved.
The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, which requires a single reading of the budget, will call for greater cooperation and more dialogue.
For our part, this dialogue must be honest.
We are committed to seeing that it is.
<D>
Mr President, I am delighted to have the opportunity to present one of the main priorities of the Swedish Presidency - the development of the strategy for the Baltic Sea area.
This proposal was largely inspired by the initiative taken by the European Parliament back in 2005 in a cross-party working group led by Christopher Beazley.
Sweden intends to use its Presidency to draw up a coherent, comprehensive strategy for the area based on proposals from the Commission.
One of the main events is an extensive high-level meeting that will take place in Stockholm tomorrow and the following day.
Naturally, Sweden and the other countries neighbouring the Baltic have a great interest in the strategy for the area, but we also believe it could serve as a model for other regions and other regional strategies that would be useful to the entire EU.
By working across borders and between different sectors in a particular region, we can deal collectively and more effectively with common challenges such as pollution and environmental destruction.
We can create new business opportunities and new jobs, and improve transport links.
Consequently, it is important that regional strategies form part of a wider European policy.
The proposed strategy for the Baltic Sea area is the result of a request made by the European Council to the Commission in December 2007 and the initiative was supported by the European Parliament in a resolution of 12 December 2007.
It is hoped that the strategy will gain the backing of the European Council meeting at the end of October.
The aim of the strategy is to improve the environment in the Baltic Sea area and to increase integration and competitiveness in the area.
The strategy addresses four challenges in particular: ensuring a sustainable environment, increasing wealth, improving accessibility and attractiveness, and guaranteeing security and certainty in the area.
Getting to grips with the environmental issues is, of course, one of the main priorities.
There are very serious threats to the Baltic Sea environment which, in turn, means that there is a risk that its economic development will be affected.
This is a very sensitive marine environment that is exposed to various kinds of environmental impact.
Decisive efforts are needed, and quickly.
In particular, overfertilisation and algal blooms caused by excess nutrient run-off are threatening the ecological equilibrium of the Baltic Sea.
At the same time, the Baltic Sea is also affected by pollution from land-based sources, hazardous substances and the effects of climate change.
As a result of these acute and serious environmental threats, the Baltic Sea area is an obvious priority in the area of the environment and we hope that conclusions will be adopted in December.
However, the serious state of health of the Baltic Sea area is not the only challenge faced by the region.
The economic crisis has made the matter of jobs and growth highly topical.
Most of the countries in the Baltic Sea area are small and are dependent on exports.
This means that we must increase integration in order to strengthen competitiveness throughout the entire Baltic Sea region.
Our aims and goals in this respect are clear.
We want the internal market to function better in our region than anywhere else, and we want the new Lisbon strategy for jobs and growth to be implemented effectively in this part of Europe.
We must address the crisis by increasing cooperation and commitment in our immediate area.
Global competitiveness requires cross-border cooperation between countries and enterprises, in research and through innovations.
The aim of the strategy for the Baltic Sea area is not to create new institutions.
Rather, we are endeavouring to use the instruments and policy areas that already exist such that together, they benefit the area in a more strategically coordinated and intelligent way.
Neither does the strategy involve new resources being injected into the area.
It is based on existing EU programmes and existing structures and on finding better ways to coordinate.
Naturally, our objective cannot be achieved overnight, but our goals are ambitious.
We deserve a cleaner Baltic Sea at the centre of an area that offers prospects for sustainable economic development across borders, supported by the entire EU.
If we can achieve this, then I am convinced that we will be serving the interests of the Baltic Sea area, and I hope that we will also create a model that can be adapted and applied effectively in other regions.
I would like to express my thanks for the positive cooperation of the Commission on this matter, and not least the European Parliament - which is, after all, the institution that originally took the initiative and has been a driving force in connection with cooperation in the Baltic Sea area throughout.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, I thank Mrs Lynne for spending time on the subject of anti-discrimination and I am completely on her side up to a certain point.
However, dear Mrs Lynne, Mrs Schroedter, Mrs Gröner and Mrs in 't Veld, you mean well, but you are not doing yourselves any favours in the end if you are now calling for another directive against discrimination that goes beyond what we already have in Europe.
I say this quite deliberately and quite bluntly here as a homosexual: you are not doing the people you want to protect any favours.
There will ultimately be a far-reaching anti-discrimination regulation against the people whom you want to protect here.
How can this be?
If we extend anti-discrimination to access to goods and services and to a shifting of the burden of proof, we will create a climate of concealed discrimination.
Very few employers will be openly willing to discuss discrimination.
Job applicants who represent a potential risk, perhaps because of their passport photograph, will no longer be contacted by the employer in case of doubt.
We are not doing people any favours in the end.
We ought instead to be worrying about the fact that the anti-discrimination directive we have today is being changed and watching to see how it pans out.
If we generate a tangled mass of bureaucracy and lawsuits as well as legal uncertainty, the acceptance of anti-discrimination regulations will decline among people in the European Union.
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I am much obliged to my colleague Mr Chatzimarkakis, who has presented a report that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats can endorse in all respects.
It is a legitimate question, however, whether this regulation was even necessary.
It will provoke intense covetous discussion, as it is difficult to explain the context to citizens.
Therefore, I think it a good thing that farming businesses are to be given an explanation of the reasons for the payments when details of these are published.
Our farmers do indeed make a valuable contribution to our society, supplying us with food day by day, taking care of our cultural landscape and making a large contribution to the functioning of rural areas.
Transparency cannot be a one-way street, however - it has to apply to both sides.
For this reason, my group supports the report's call to make users sign on or register when using the information.
As my colleague has just mentioned, it is also important that this directive does not invalidate data protection provisions, particularly those of Member States.
In the interests of equal treatment, however, I would ask the Commission to present a regulation ensuring transparency also in non-governmental organisations, for example.
I am convinced that more EU funds are being channelled into shady projects in the case of NGOs than is happening in the agricultural sector.
This report gives us the opportunity to show the public why taxpayers' money is being spent on agriculture.
Using the report appropriately will facilitate success in demonstrating to the public the great importance of European agriculture, in which case this Transparency Directive will have served its purpose.
<D>
Mr President of the Republic of France, in their daily lives the people of Europe unfortunately have to cope with the disastrous effects of the policies of the European authorities in Brussels and Frankfurt.
The people of Europe are seeing more and more every day that all of their powers are trickling through their fingers, that their freedoms are being taken away, whether it be purchasing power, an expensive euro, GMOs, tax, fisheries, a lack of trade protection, immigration, or even football, which you yourself mentioned a few moments ago.
Everything is trickling through their fingers, and I would say, Mr President of the Republic, President of the European Union, that everything is trickling through your fingers.
You say so yourself, you point it out as a criticism.
Well it is high time to act and to bring your actions in line with your words.
A moment ago you criticised the lack of Community preference, and you are right.
However, let me remind you that it was removed by the Marrakesh Agreement, which you approved, and it is not in the Lisbon Treaty, which you drew up.
You deplore the irresponsibility of the Central Bank, and you ask for a debate to be started.
As for us, we want decisions.
Perhaps I can remind you here that this independence of the Central Bank, this irresponsibility that we see at work every day, was organised and formalised by the Maastricht Treaty.
You regret having obtained the agreement of Brussels for a drop in oil taxation, but that is simply a consequence of the Treaties of Nice and Amsterdam, which you ratified through the parliamentary route.
In short, you complain today and every day about the effects of what you encourage every day, in other words stripping away the powers of the State for the benefit of post-democratic forums, made up of officials, bankers and judges.
Your Presidency of the European Union is a historic opportunity to get Europe moving in the right direction again, a Europe rooted in the freedom of nations that respects democracy.
This is why we are asking you to honour the vote of the Irish people and to pronounce the Lisbon Treaty dead.
It is not the European people who have to reconcile with Brussels, it is Brussels that has to reconcile with the European people!
(Applause from the speaker's group)
<D>
in writing. - (NL) The battle against the bulge must start from a young age.
The supply of fresh fruit in schools can be a huge incentive to eat healthily.
This is why this scheme, which makes at least one piece of fruit available to each child between the ages of 3 and 10, is to be welcomed with open arms.
It is estimated that in the European Union, 22 million children are overweight, 5.1 million of whom are obese.
Not only does this create many health problems, it also increases the cost of healthcare in the Member States.
If the Commission endorses Parliament's proposal to increase the budget from EUR 90 million to EUR 500 million, every child can learn good eating habits from a young age.
This gives them more chances of sustaining these habits and preventing obesity as a result.
This report also comments on the composition of the fruit supply.
The Member States should give preference to locally produced and seasonal fruit.
The report calls for health and eating advice for children, together with information about the characteristics of organic farming.
I am pleased with the content of the report, and for that reason, I voted in favour.
<D>
Mr President, after 36 years of membership, what has the European Union meant for Britain?
It means that we no longer govern ourselves.
Between 75% and 85% of our laws now come from the EU and not from our own parliament.
The EU costs Britain at least GBP 56 billion per annum - or the equivalent of GBP 900 per annum for every man, woman and child.
We no longer control our own borders and suffer unlimited and uncontrolled immigration.
EU human rights legislation means that we can no longer effectively protect ourselves from foreign criminals, illegal immigrants and bogus asylum seekers.
The European arrest warrant and trials in absentia mean that we have lost our most basic protections from unjust arrest and imprisonment.
EU membership is a disaster for Britain.
It is a grievous and unnecessary self-inflicted wound.
The only solution to the problem is Britain's unconditional withdrawal from the European Union.
<D>
I voted against the resolution on banning the use of cyanide mining technologies by the end of 2011 for a number of reasons.
Halting current mining projects using cyanide technologies would deal a severe blow to the Member States using this technology (Finland, Sweden, Spain, Romania, Bulgaria and Greece) and to the Member States which produce cyanides (Belgium, the UK, Czech Republic and Germany).
Europe would become 100% dependent on importing gold, a metal used in Europe's precious metals industry, as well as in the electronics sector.
Approximately 87% of cyanide production is used in other industrial sectors outside the mining industry, such as the production of vitamins, jewellery, adhesives, electronic components for computers, fireproof insulation materials, cosmetics, nylon, paints, medicines, and so on.
There are technologies in the economic sector which pose a hazard to human health and the environment.
Cyanide technology is just one of them.
Regulations and standards are in place to allow such activities to be carried out in safe conditions, in order to prevent any adverse impact.
This principle applies to mining technology as well.
There is legislation in force which must be respected.
We do not have the right to ban, but we do have the right to protect.
<D>
(ES) Madam President, the programme the Commission is proposing to us, in terms of meeting the targets in order to ensure our credibility, calls on each of us to do what we can, to rise to this challenge and turn it into an opportunity to become more competitive, proposing it in such a way that ensure that by cooperating we might all achieve this on a global level without wasting any time.
It is, of course, a very encouraging programme full of fascinating challenges.
One of those mentioned - and which I support - is the challenge of proposing energy sources that offer an alternative to nuclear energy.
As far as the transport sector is concerned, I believe that it is a sector that presents a major challenge and I would therefore call on the Commission to make use of the instruments that are currently on the table, namely the Logistics Action Plan.
Logistics, which are now becoming a factor of competition, should be one of the instruments used to apply intelligence to mobility and to enable us to find appropriate solutions to help reduce emissions.
As regards the Galileo project, on which there has little progress since we did not see all of its potential, the applications in terms of achieving a reduction in emissions should present another challenge.
Finally, I believe that the urban transport plan is now a real possibility.
<D>
in writing. - I would like to speak about the European Digital Agenda.
The Commission's figures show that barriers to the digital single market exist: only 7% of online transactions are cross-border.
Although Internet and relevant infrastructure objectives serve as solid prerequisites for further development, improving the infrastructure must be complemented by the creation of a pan-European regulatory framework, utilisation of services and enhancement of ICT skills.
By 2020, a single and secure European e-services area should be created.
It would provide EU citizens with easy and safe access to all digital services, both public and commercial.
Member States should develop national plans for the digital switchover of public services.
Particular focus should be on encouraging the participation of lower socio-economic groups, as they are the most likely to be excluded from the digital society.
Cross-border e-authentication and digital signatures should be characterised by legal and technical interoperability so that cross border e-authentication could be used by all service providers and consumers across Europe.
The comprehensive approach to the digital single market should include reducing the remaining fragmentation in financial services, logistics, consumer protection and intellectual property.
A 100% target should be set for citizens to have both access to, and the ability to use, e-services.
<D>
(ES) Madam President, Commissioners, the proposal for a regulation drawn up by the European Commission to replace Directive 91/414/CE achieves greater harmonisation of authorisation procedures while at the same time providing for consumer protection.
However, the result obtained in the Environment Committee not only fails to have regard to the objective of greater harmonisation but unjustifiably overhauls measures aimed at protecting the consumer and the environment.
The report is based on a total lack of faith in the existing methods of agricultural production in the European Union.
Farmers, however, are not the only ones who will suffer: consumers are likely to suffer as well, because many crops will become unviable, making imports necessary, with a knock-on effect for food security.
Insufficient consideration has been given to the fact that the approval and use of plant protection products is already subject to strict controls, both by the European Food Safety Authority and by the competent authorities of the Member States.
Moreover, this proposal changes the number of active substances from 1 100 as authorised in 1991, to 148, which are listed in Annex I to this proposal.
Of those 148 substances, only 34 are insecticides, nematocides or acaricides, which are the substances most needed for cultivation in Mediterranean Europe where the level of attack by insects is the highest in the entire Union.
Insects are not only a menace to plants, but are also transmitters of very serious human illnesses.
The Commission proposal to divide the European Union into three zones for the mutual recognition of plant protection products should be reinstated.
Criteria for precluding pesticides must be based on proper risk analyses.
Without a risk analysis it is impossible to determine the effect of these substances on health or the environment.
Finally, I would like to point out that the dose makes the poison.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - I can provide you with all the detailed data that we have on various Member States.
We have not analysed it, it is not our job to see why certain Member States did worse than others, but during our work, we exchanged good practices.
I am very pleased to say that some countries that have followed good practices have shown very good progress since 2006 in most of these indicators.
Regarding elementary school, unfortunately, we do not have studies similar to the PISA one.
No such study exists.
Subject: Fragmented digital markets and consequences for the educational system and investments in geographically isolated regions
According to the Commission Communication on a Digital Agenda for Europe, Europe is still a patchwork of national online markets, and Europeans are prevented from enjoying the benefits of a digital single market by solvable problems such as the lack of investment in networks.
As a result, the education provided in many remote - in particular, mountainous and island - regions lags behind technologically and investments in specific geographical locations are also affected.
Will the Commission say:
Since ICT accounts for 5% of European GDP, having a market value of € 660 billion annually, while making a much greater contribution to increasing total productivity (20% directly from the ICT sector and 30% from ICT investments), how does it intend to address the fragmentation of digital markets?
Are any targeted Community actions being developed to address the problem of low national investments in networks, especially for geographically isolated regions?
<D>
(SL) We in the ALDE Group support Mr Meier's report.
The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) deserves an opportunity and a better future.
What it also needs, however, is a modicum of international respect, including the right to its own identity and recognition of its own language and culture.
The issue of the country's name has been dragging on for too long and the atmosphere in the country has been worsening for some time.
There has been more and more populism and nationalism, there is too much political entrenchment, and verbal attacks are being levelled at neighbouring countries.
Naming infrastructural installations after characters from the periods of Greek history which predated the arrival of the Slavs in those regions is not conducive to good neighbourly relations.
Erecting more 10 m tall monuments is unnecessary.
If we wish to prevent instability, we need to help the state, politicians and people of FYROM to break out of the blockade.
Abolishing visas does not go far enough.
What this country needs is a date for the beginning of negotiations.
They deserve the opportunity to show their merit during the accession process.
We need to help them now and show that we have confidence in them.
This will help us contribute stability to the region and facilitate development in a positive direction.
FYROM needs a positive response now, because time is very much of the essence.
In fact, you could say that time is money.
Allow me also to say a few words about Croatia.
Commissioner, two former prime ministers of Slovenia and Croatia, respectively, namely Drnovšek and Račan, attained a major achievement when they concluded an agreement concerning the border.
Unfortunately, they are no longer with us, but they had the courage to press ahead, invest in the future and attain an achievement of some kind.
I think it is right for you to urge both governments to follow in their footsteps and to reach an agreement concerning the border again, and in the near future, too.
That would be a good thing for Slovenia, Croatia, the European Union and the Western Balkans.
<D>
rapporteur. - (FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our debates on this Second Strategic Energy Review have of course been marked by this new gas-supply crisis between Russia and Ukraine.
This crisis has brought to light shortcomings, the fragility of the interconnections and the European Union's difficulty in reacting and in speaking with one voice.
It has revealed, for the third time, the need for a common energy policy.
However, I must say - and our Commissioner has just pointed this out - that we are now seeing progress and more cooperation and solidarity among Member States, and thus hopes of a solution with which to manage these crises.
I should like to thank the Members who have done a great deal to enrich this report, which we drafted quickly, since we were informed of the communication in November.
I am not going to explain in detail everything that we set out in this resolution, but I shall perhaps instead point out what messages the Committee on Industry, Research and Industry wished to put across with it.
The context is as follows: the climate constraint is going to get tougher, the European Union's security of supply is being threatened by ever more serious and frequent crises, and its competitiveness may be harmed.
This implies the need to think differently about energy consumption and use within the European Union, to think differently about our energy resources, and to allow ourselves to exploit this considerable source of jobs that exists in the energy sector, jobs that are so crucial in the context of the economic crisis that we are going through.
What are we proposing?
There is the short term: promoting the 3x20 by 2020 vision of the energy and climate change package so as to turn it into European energy policy.
This is a joint action at several levels - global, European, national and local - which means that the main priorities that we have indicated are of course energy saving, energy efficiency and the development of renewable energies, since the European Union's potential in this area is great.
In particular, the objective of 20% energy efficiency will have to be made binding.
Secondly, the European Union's security of supply will have to be improved through investment in the networks and, in particular, in the interconnections.
Solidarity among the Member States means that the networks must supply regions that are isolated and highly dependent on a single supplier.
This also means that the Directive on the security of the gas supply will have to be revised in order to make it a European crisis management tool.
Improving the security of supply also means strengthening and structuring the dialogue with transit countries and producer countries.
These energy interdependence relations need to be developed, particularly those with Russia and the Mediterranean area.
Thirdly, having an internal market is a crucial factor in terms of the security of supply.
How, though, can a Member State be supplied via another Member State if the interconnections are weak or non-existent?
Fourthly, we need to identify the best practices at international level.
In this regard, let us strengthen our exchanges of information with Japan and the United States - California, in particular - but let us not delude ourselves: our relations with these energy-consuming countries are founded on both cooperation and competition, especially in terms of energy technologies.
Then there is the long term, which is very important.
The task is to predict the future of the European Union's energy supply.
We should be able by, say, 2010-2020, to write road maps on a scenario basis for the European Union's supply in 2050.
To do this, ambitious objectives must be set with regard to the fight against climate change.
Our committee is proposing a reduction of 60-80%, but perhaps in future of at least 80%, in CO2 emissions, a 35% increase in energy efficiency and a 60% share of renewable energies, to be achieved by 2050.
Our Parliament is calling for this road map to envisage developing the share of the different energy sources so that investments can be planned in means of production, interconnections, and research and development.
In the energy mix for 2050 the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy has confirmed the share of nuclear energy alongside the other energy sources, such as renewable energies, as well as the desire to develop means of energy storage and to use solar energy, which is an infinite resource.
<D>
It is well known that the European Union has exclusive competence in matters of external trade policy, which is the basis for this proposal for a regulation.
It is founded on Article 207(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which provides for the exclusive competence of the EU in matters of foreign direct investment as part of the common commercial policy.
However, in general, the European Commission's positions do not respect the interests of all the Member States equally.
The importance of trade policy and, of course, of investment policy as instruments for promoting the interests of a country and its people according to its specific characteristics and conditions are all too clear.
What is also clear - as in the case of Portugal, for example - is the damage that results from trade and investment policies that do not give due consideration to the interests, circumstances and conditions of the country, since they are essentially decided by the major powers of the EU in defence of the interests of their major companies; the balance within the EU tipped decisively towards these powers when the Union strengthened its competences.
Among other serious aspects, this regulation intends to give the Commission the power to withdraw authorisations, to ask Member States to negotiate or reject bilateral investment treaties (BITs) and to approve new BITs.
That is why we voted against.
<D>
(NL) Mr President, I should like to thank the interpreters for working overtime.
All I wanted to add is that I have voted emphatically against the Schmitt report, not least because education, to my mind, is a competence that should remain in Member State hands, as it is not really Europe's concern.
This is a fundamental issue.
I also have other objections to the Schmitt report, though.
For example, the fact that this report is based on the idea that the education systems in the various European countries should simply adjust to the presence of non-European immigrants, rather than the other way round.
It is beyond me how this position can be squared with integration, let alone the promotion of assimilation, as the exact opposite of this will be the result.
This report, as ever, also contains the obligatory Roma paragraph, of course, again without asking who is, in fact, responsible for what.
It also states that the Member States should ensure that immigrant children should be taught in their own mother tongues and that the teaching staff should specifically reflect the multicultural society.
Forgive me for saying this, but this is a politically correct report that creates more problems than it solves.
<D>
(HU) Thank you, Madam President.
Ladies and gentlemen, the gradual opening up of the postal services market is an important milestone in achieving the internal market.
It will contribute to ending special rights within the postal sectors, and it will set a specific and irrevocable date for opening the market, ensuring a sustainable, high level of universal service.
Opening the market will intensify competition, and so the level of service can be improved with regard to quality, price and opportunities for choice.
This measure will promote the harmonisation of the fundamental principles relating to the regulation of postal services, and will probably produce lower tariffs as well as better and more innovative services, and greater conditions for growth and employment will still be created.
The amendment to the Directive is the result of an exemplary compromise, a compromise that took into account the differences arising from the historical and economical characteristics of the Member States.
It pays regard to the fact that preparing for liberalisation requires more time in some Member States, mainly those in Central Eastern Europe.
At the same time, taking into account the interests of others and in order to prevent distortion of competition in the market in countries where the postal sector is already fully liberalised, the postal services of countries that are not yet opening their market may not provide services until the derogation deadline at the end of December 2012.
I would like to thank Mr Ferber for his work, but naturally thanks are also due to Mr Simpson, the shadow rapporteur.
<D>
The Dell group, yesterday number one, today number three in the world in the field of information technology, with an estimated stock market value of USD 18 billion, posting a USD 337 million profit for the third quarter of 2009, and predicting an even bigger profit for the fourth quarter ...
Yes, I am behind Dell's employees!
Yes, I hope they find a job and get back to living a dignified life as soon as possible!
But, no, I will not contribute to the plundering of European taxpayers.
I will not, under any circumstances, join in showing any more contempt for employees who are in a state of utter disarray.
It is up to the guilty to pay and up to Europe to implement a strong industrial policy that meets the needs of the populations before dividends are allowed to be distributed!
<D>
The debate on the Maternity Leave Directive and the own-initiative report on precarious women workers touches on the most important reason for all work to promote equality.
The opportunity and prerequisites for women to be able to support themselves form the platform for equality in all political areas.
This coming Wednesday, we will have the opportunity to open the way for women to participate fully on the labour market.
I regret the fact that, in 2010, we are still talking about maternity leave rather than parental leave.
For me, it is self-evident that children have the right to both of their parents and I believe that we should also take a look at the Convention on the Rights of the Child in this case.
We are discussing the rights of mothers and of fathers, but we also need to discuss the right - the unconditional right - of a child to build a close relationship with both parents.
We have talked very loudly about the costs of this leave and in quite a different tone to the one we used to discuss millions of euro in support for banks and the motor industry, among other things.
Sometimes I ask myself whether it is easier to accept costs in traditional masculine areas than it is in connection with equality issues and the right of a child to have both parents.
I also think that the costs have been discussed without taking account of the benefits both to the individual and in socio-economic terms that this proposal entails.
Many have talked about the demographic future, that too few children are being born.
However, we now have the opportunity to try to ensure that it is possible to have more children.
The Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left and I support Mrs Estrela's and Mrs Thomsen's proposals, which we voted on in the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, where we improved the possibilities.
However, I see a number of problems for certain Member States that currently have considerably better parental leave.
I would like this to be legislation that confers rights, rather than imposing an obligation on one parent.
I would also like the Convention on the Rights of the Child and a child's right to both parents to be much more evident.
There are also problems with the levels of remuneration in certain Member States.
Someone mentioned here in this debate that today employers ask women of child-bearing age whether they intend to have children.
I therefore hope that in the future, in the very near future, we will ask the same question of fathers, as children - one again - are the concern of both parents.
That is something that we need to take seriously.
<D>
- (CS) In September last year I warned on YouTube and elsewhere against the growing incidence of hazardous toys and I promised that we would take measures here to ensure that by Christmas the market would be a safer place.
Many journalists ridiculed this, but others understood the issue.
Such a powerful wave of checks was unleashed that by Christmas millions of hazardous toys had been withdrawn from the market.
Even before Christmas.
I appreciate the way that the European Commission responded quickly to our request and put forward a new, tougher directive.
I also highly appreciate the efficient work of Mrs Thyssen.
Not forgetting to mention, of course, the flexibility of the French Presidency.
The directive responds to new developments in man-made materials and also to findings in relation to physical harm to children etc.
It is therefore stricter on the producers while also placing a bigger stick into the hands of monitoring bodies.
I consider it highly important that the directive also increases or rather transfers legal responsibility to importers.
After all, the main problem does not relate to European producers but to imports.
80% of cases concern toys from China.
I also firmly believe that by next year, that is, even before the directive comes into force, importers will begin to select very carefully the factories - Chinese or otherwise - from which they will import toys into Europe.
And they will select only those producers who meet European standards.
If only the same could be achieved with other products as well.
This afternoon I had another meeting with toy makers from the Czech Republic and I must tell you that they have given a warm welcome to this directive and to the harmonisation of standards.
Of course they would like us to increase the legal responsibility of the accredited testing bodies.
This is because sometimes, despite having paid for tests, inspectors sooner or later identify specific shortcomings.
For small producers these not inconsiderable costs may be a complete waste of money.
I would also like to bring to your attention how the directive is being circumvented, not only the existing one but probably the new one we are passing this week as well.
Although it will indeed not be possible to state 'this is not a toy' on products that look like toys, producers will unfortunately label their toys as 'decorations'.
This directive is therefore just a first step and there is still much work to be done.
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, of course, passenger name records are not a new concept for aviation security.
This House has debated both shortcomings and merits on many previous occasions.
In general, my concerns are - regardless of whether the system is between the US, Canada, Australia or in a general EU framework - who will use the data, what will it be used for and how will it be protected?
In my opinion, PNR systems are a valuable tool in the fight against terrorism, but we must ensure that the system does not just become another tool to keep data on citizens.
The purpose of PNR should be to combat terrorism, and I have to say - I am very sorry to say this - that the Commissioner, in his opening statement, did not give me the confidence that that would be the purpose limitation which we all seek.
It should be purpose-limited to the organisations whose remit is to fight against terror.
Counterterrorism measures must not be made an excuse for a catch-all system for personal data.
In essence, we must ensure that such systems stick to what they are designed for, which is an aid to the security services to identify and target the people who are the biggest threat.
I welcome PNR systems as one part of our approach to counterterrorism but, to the same degree, believe that we must be flexible in our approach when negotiating with third countries.
We must approach the important issue of data protection on EU citizens and whether - and in which way - this data is passed to others.
Thus I urge this House to take PNR seriously as part of a global tool to make our skies safer.
As long as we approach the issue in a proportionate manner and reduce the potential for misuse, PNR could serve as a vital tool to protect the innocent traveller and disrupt the potential terrorist.
In conclusion, I have always said that, personally, these systems would make me feel safer at 35 000 feet.
<D>
Madam President, Mr Mavrommatis is always very active and always involved in issues regarding transport.
The Commission's proposals are always accompanied by an impact assessment.
This is true in particular of the November 2005 proposals on the third maritime safety package.
The Commission's proposals in this sector take particular account of the relevant international conventions.
In the majority of cases, the purpose of the legislative proposals is to invite the Member States to ratify the conventions or to implement them within the Community.
They are never born out of an attempt to acquire new competences.
I would like to clear up a common misunderstanding: the Community already has the necessary competences for maritime safety within the framework of the common transport policy.
It is, however, inevitable that when the European Parliament and the Council legislate, Member States' ability to act in isolation at international level is therefore limited.
Nonetheless, this is not to Member States' disadvantage.
Indeed, it serves to strengthen our collective influence within the international community, thereby increasing the level of protection of the life of citizens and of the environment.
Sometimes, Europe must simply take the initiative.
This happened, for example, when we introduced the accelerated withdrawal of single-hull oil tankers and our decision was then followed by a similar one on the part of the International Maritime Organisation.
Mr Mavrommatis, you are well aware of the problems with the International Maritime Organisation: we cannot always take decisions on our own.
There are competences that do not concern Europe, and continual comparison with this organisation is therefore necessary, not least because our seas are frequented by vessels flying the flags of countries that do not belong to our Union.
With the proposed new legislation on maritime safety, the Commission hopes, though, to redress the balance of the global dimension of maritime transport, which calls for global solutions while taking account of the limitations of the global legal framework.
Mr Mavrommatis, Community action is a tangible expression of the collective effort and commitment of the Member States, not an imposition from the outside, running counter to their interests.
Thanks to our efforts and yours, the number of vessels in European waters that do not comply with current standards has dropped dramatically.
The Commission will continue to pursue a balanced but proactive policy, with the protection of the life and livelihood of our citizens as its main objective.
<D>
Mr President, addressing concerns about energy supply is one of the major and most important issues facing the European Union, linked as it is with concerns about climate change.
Security of supply and rising cost, with prices up 100% in the last five years, are major worries.
Well, for Ireland the challenges are particularly great.
We face growing demand for energy and yet a high dependency on imported fossil fuels.
We are 90% dependent.
We need to invest heavily in our infrastructure, work towards liberalising the market and reduce our carbon emissions.
Parliament is looking at an action plan on implementing energy policy for Europe.
Within Ireland we are establishing an all-Ireland energy market with the merging of electricity markets north and south.
That is positive, but it is not enough.
The scale of the market is too small.
To achieve a harmonised energy market, inter-connection with the rest of the European Union is vital for Ireland - but that will cost money, and I would urge the Irish Government to look at the use of cohesion funding to make that investment, because it is necessary for the continuation of Irish economic growth.
<D>
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) Mr President, Commissioner, I consider it a very positive step that we are discussing together all the reports connected by the common theme of creating and revising the Community's secondary law.
I would like to comment briefly on Mr Gargani's report.
I believe that the report is very good on the whole and I therefore recommend that the House adopt it.
I fully agree with the proposal that the strategy of simplifying the legal environment should have political priority.
In that regard, however, I believe that it is necessary to strengthen the role of the European Parliament in the legislative process.
What I have in mind here is that Parliament should have the same law-making initiative as the Commission, which would undoubtedly have a positive effect on the process of simplifying and improving the quality of the legal environment in Europe.
I would also like to voice my reservations regarding the targets set by the Commission, which stipulate that not only Community but also national legislation should be reduced by 25% by the year 2012.
The schedule of simplification for the years 2006-2009 provides for 43 revisions, 12 codifications, 26 other measures and 8 repeals.
But at the same time 500 new legislative initiatives are expected in the area of codifications alone.
This makes me think that the Commission's plans for reduction in the secondary Community legislation are not realistic.
<D>
Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate all the Member States on their achievements in making it possible for citizens in Poland, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Hungary, Slovakia, Malta and in the current Schengen countries to finally fully benefit from the free movement of persons, which is one of the pillars of the European Union.
This is a real benefit for the citizens of the Member States that joined the EU in 2004.
It will make travelling quicker and easier.
For all the Member States of the European Union, this shows the benefit of acting together in the European framework.
An area without internal border control is an amazing achievement, without historical precedent.
From 21 December onwards, travel will be possible from, for example, the Iberian Peninsula to the Baltic States and from Greece to Finland without border checks.
This is truly symbolic of a united Europe and a basic right for all European citizens.
As you are all aware, this historic achievement follows much preparation.
Joining the Schengen area is not an easy undertaking.
It is a challenge, and we must strike the right balance between freedom and security.
Lifting internal border controls is also a question of trust between Member States.
It is through a peer evaluation process, the 'Schengen Evaluation', that Member States gain confidence in each other's capacity to guard the external borders on behalf of all the others and issue visas valid for the whole Schengen area.
Member States will also improve police cooperation and security controls within the broader Schengen space, in order to prevent criminals from enjoying free movement and better opportunities to act illegally.
All this would not have been possible without financial solidarity.
The Schengen Facility, providing nearly EUR 1 billion, enabled the new Member States to meet, in particular, the challenge of building up an efficient border control and becoming full partners in the Schengen area.
I would also like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Coelho, and the European Parliament for their positive support in reaching this fundamental achievement, and last, but not least, I congratulate the Portuguese Presidency.
I congratulate you personally, and Ministers of the Interior, Minister Costa and Minister Pereira, on your strategic partnership and clarity of purpose for the successful implementation of the Schengen information system project, known as 'SIS One For All'.
We have worked hard, together with the former German and the future Slovenian Presidencies, to support our Portuguese colleagues, and we have succeeded.
This shows what can be accomplished if everyone is fully committed to a complex project.
Now, ladies and gentlemen, work is not finished.
Our ultimate goal is to make Schengen Information System II fully operational by December 2008.
We will again have to work very hard together.
<D>
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, Umberto Eco said that whoever reads books lives twice.
The report by Mrs Descamps provides a good account of the modern approach to cultural and educational issues.
I also referred to the matter in my report on the contribution of the future regional policy to the innovative capacity of the European Union.
Just as Gutenberg's invention marked a turning point in human development at the time, so we can today refer to a cultural revolution brought about by the Internet.
What is at issue is widespread access to the European, or indeed to the world, treasury of humankind's spiritual and material heritage.
The latter comprises contemporary creations along with those dating back over the centuries arising out of different cultures and languages.
Copyright and related rights are certainly an issue in this context.
I recognise what has already been achieved in this regard in many Member States, including the work of the National Library of Poland.
I would like to take this opportunity to stress the importance of more extensive broadband access.
I believe we should find a way of cofinancing digitisation from the Union's resources.
I shall conclude by referring to Goethe, who said that when he read a good book he felt as if he had made a new friend.
Just think how many good friends we could make through the European digital library!
<D>
in writing. - (SV) We have chosen to vote in favour of the report on sanctions against employers of illegally staying third-country nationals.
The proposal aims to prevent the exploitation of illegally staying third-country nationals by employers and to strengthen the rights of workers.
The person who is to be punished in the event of illegal employment is the employer who breaks the law, not the worker.
There is an absence of this type of legislation in certain countries within the EU.
Other countries have legislation, but it is not implemented or observed.
Common EU rules to prevent exploitation and the employment of illegally staying workers are therefore one way of raising the bar for many EU countries.
The proposal that we are voting on today has many shortcomings.
If the decision had been ours, many parts of it would have been different.
We would have liked to see greater protection for women involved in domestic work, for example.
However, the alternative is to have no directive at all and therefore less protection for the four to eight million illegally staying third-country nationals that are currently working illegally within the EU and who, in their very vulnerable situation, are repeatedly exploited by employers.
While it is important to prevent illegal immigration and the exploitation of illegally staying third-country nationals, we must also ensure that we increase the opportunities for people to settle and seek work within the EU on a legal basis.
This is regulated in other directives that the European Parliament has been involved in negotiating over the last year.
<D>
(PL) I believe there are two different approaches to China.
One is to provide assistance following the misfortune that has recently befallen it.
We cannot react otherwise.
It is our moral duty to help.
The fact that we enjoy a better financial and economic situation is a further reason to offer aid.
We simply have to do so.
The second approach involves remaining constantly aware that in normal times we should help the Chinese.
By this I mean that, when the country is not afflicted by disaster, we ought to help the people of China by reminding their leaders about their citizens' rights.
We should do so most emphatically.
We need to respond appropriately to both situations.
This will make things very clear.
I believe the people of China will recognise our effort and thank us for it.
<D>
(PT) This year European wealth will fall by 4% and unemployment will increase up to 26 million.
The world and the European Union should have done more, better and earlier with regard to regulating the financial markets.
I welcome the work done by this Parliament, much of it in an atmosphere of urgency, but I would underline the contribution made by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, which should have received more recognition at the appropriate time.
I regret that the Commission's reaction has been slower, more piecemeal and more limited than the situation required and requires, as illustrated by the recent proposal on hedge funds.
The adoption of the directive on capital requirements is another step in the right direction.
We know that it is not ambitious enough and falls short of expectations, but today the most important thing is to give a clear signal to the financial institutions and markets that business as usual has come to an end.
I applaud the work of the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs, particularly Pervenche Berès, in their search for a compromise.
This directive does introduce clear rules, but a great deal of work will still have to be done during the next revision on some of the more controversial issues, particularly on the level of retention for the purposes of securitisation.
Today it is vital that this Parliament ensures the adoption of this directive, thus sending a clear message to European citizens that things are changing and will continue to change, and that we are particularly concerned about them.
<D>
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I listened carefully to what Mr Nassauer had to say; he made a good analysis of the state of play of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, which leads 21 governments in the European Union, provides the great majority of Commissioners and holds a large majority in the European Parliament.
I suggest that you repeat the description that you have just given of the state of play of your group as well as of the Commission at an EPP Congress - then you will make some progress.
For one thing is quite true: the question that we have to discuss here is how far removed is Europe - and, above all, how far removed are the Member States that make up this Union and the governments of those Member States - from citizens' everyday problems?
It is rather too easy simply to say that it is just the European institutions' fault.
We shall certainly have to take issue with the Commission.
Didn't it do well, presenting the package of measures on the Friday after the Irish referendum - absolutely brilliant!
It did not include in the Irish referendum the requisite measures to be taken by the Commission which it has just set out for us.
Then it announced them on the Friday when the votes were being counted.
What a monumental error.
We shall certainly have to talk about this.
However, we most certainly cannot stand here and say that it was the Commission's fault and then just give the institution a bit of a dressing-down.
That would be too easy.
I shall come back to this in just a moment.
Firstly, there is something that I should like to say to the Presidency of the Council.
You ran a good Presidency.
The President of this House has rightly said that it was a Parliament-friendly Presidency.
I should also like to thank you for a matter which you and I discussed early this year: the lifting of the embargo against Cuba was, to my mind, a vitally important step because it will significantly simplify the European Union's policy on Latin America.
This is an element of strategic partnership that we must promote in the area of climate change and energy policy.
I think that it is good that you have cleared an obstacle out the way.
Incidentally, you have ended on a hypocritical note, hypocritical in the sense that some of the Member States which have used their veto in the Council constantly to perpetuate this embargo are the same ones as those which are among the largest direct investors in Cuba.
It was, therefore, a very, very good measure!
You have made progress in a number of other areas under your Presidency, areas which I no longer need to refer to individually, as they have been mentioned by other speakers in this House.
However, I think that a small country, a new Member State of the European Union, that has run such a good Presidency also deserves to be thanked and praised by the European Parliament!
(Applause)
Many fine words have been spoken today about the Treaty that must be saved.
Yes, indeed!
Many grandiose announcements have been made about what the EU can do - or rather, what the Commission can propose and what the Member States must implement.
By all means, let us have the principle of subsidiarity, but, in that case, the Member States also need to act.
In that case, they also need to act in an area which is most notably lacking in the European Union: social balance.
What is lacking in Europe is no longer the single market - we have enough of that.
What is lacking in Europe is no longer entrepreneurial freedom - we have enough of that.
What is lacking in Europe is a socially and politically responsible counterweight to this development of the single market!
Europe's citizens are aware of this: they are aware that there is always talk in the Commission of social measures, but that no such action is ever forthcoming.
That is the crucial reason why Europe's citizens are getting the jitters about this Union.
I should like to give you a small example: a neighbour of mine who lives in my constituency has a net income of EUR 1 300.
He pays EUR 600 for his flat and for heating bills, so that includes energy costs - at least, it did...
He then has EUR 700 left for him, his wife and his two children to live on.
The day before yesterday, he told me that, this year, he has had to spend EUR 700 more on energy costs - for petrol when driving to work and for home heating costs: EUR 700 more.
EUR 700 more means that, every month, he has to save EUR 60 - from the EUR 700 net he has to live on - to cover his energy costs.
That is almost 10% of the amount of money available for living costs.
These people are not interested in the EU Treaty, nor are they interested in the attitudes that we strike in this House.
What they need is direct assistance, and they need it now!
If these people believe that shareholder value is more important to the Commission than their daily living conditions, then they will turn their backs on Europe.
Therefore, I should like to say that, for us, this summit was not a success because, once again, it did not focus on these issues.
As long as we are talking about institutions, and people believe that these institutions do not pay heed to what you, Mr Janša, have rightly said, namely, that Europe should be important to each and every citizen because each and every citizen should feel that he is important to the European Union, as long as people have the impression that they, with their day-to-day concerns, are not important to the EU, we will not succeed in restoring confidence in Europe.
(Applause)
<D>
Mr President, as far as the Treaty is concerned, the devil is not in the detail, he is in the ratification.
We should remember Denmark in 1992, Ireland in 2001, France and the Netherlands in 2005, and even Sweden on the euro in 2003.
Nowhere is safe from a no vote.
Obviously each Member State is in charge of its own ratification, whether through parliamentary channels or through a referendum, but is it really impossible to coordinate the whole thing?
I think that bringing all the ratifications together would prevent an endless stream of national debates and would allow European public opinion to emerge more strongly.
I can suggest a date, Mr President: the first fortnight in May 2008, because this is the fortnight that saw the end of the Second World War, and sees Europe Day on 9 May, and this year it will be the sixtieth anniversary of the Hague Congress, which set Europe in motion, chaired by Winston Churchill.
For us, the French, it is also the election of a great European, François Mitterrand, on 10 May.
It would help a little if the ratifications were coordinated.
After all, we have got rid of the symbols of the Treaty, but symbols can be put back in a calendar.
Why not write them into certain dates?
Because regardless of what we think of the drafting of the treaty - and our fellow member Mr Goebbels was rather harsh about this - we must at all costs nevertheless ensure that this step in European history is taken.
So I put this suggestion to you: agree on this fortnight!
(Applause)
<D>
Since the European Union acquired shared competence over justice and home affairs, huge progress has been made in the area of civil justice.
Article 67 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union establishes the importance of respecting the different legal systems and traditions within the EU and Mr Berlinguer's report highlights this as one of the strengths of the EU.
Subsidiarity is one of the basic principles of EU law and is based on the condition that the subordinate member is able to resolve problems and carry out tasks independently.
The areas of justice and home affairs have traditionally been the responsibility of the Member States.
Each Member State has its own special features and traditions which reflect the cultural diversity of Europe.
However, in order to keep pace with the changing reality in today's world, joint responsibility with the European Union is needed.
Nowadays, treaties with cross-border implications are the rule and partnerships or families where the partners come from different Member States are commonplace.
However, these involve challenges for national civil legislation which we will have to overcome.
As the rapporteur recommends, it is now time to develop a European judicial culture alongside the national judicial cultures.
<D>
rapporteur. - (HU) I would like to say only a few words.
On the one hand, I would like to say thank you for the assistance received from shadow rapporteurs during these very tough negotiations, for the assistance of the committee, and what is very important, for the assistance of the Spanish Presidency.
When negotiations stalled, the Spanish Presidency put them back on track at the beginning of this year.
The compromise is essentially that the Council approved the text for the microfinance instrument adopted by Parliament at first reading, which was important for a quick launch.
The other important part of the compromise is that EUR 60 million is reallocated from PROGRESS and EUR 40 million from the margin, while financing instruments of up to EUR 20 million can be reinstated in PROGRESS upon recommendation of the Commission.
I would like to ask the Council to read the text of the communication made in this matter, and it would be important to publish this when the text of the agreement is published in the Official Journal.
We will have a very important crisis management tool in our hands.
I would like to ask everybody to help ensure that this information reaches Member States, so that more people in difficulties can use this instrument to launch businesses.
I can promise on behalf of both the committee and myself that I will monitor the launch and subsequent operation of the programme.
We truly hope that it will be a success.
<D>
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, I would also like to voice my thanks for the valuable contributions and support of many of my fellow Members.
I think it has been shown that on the one hand, we must maintain solidarity as a key European asset, and that on the other hand, we must target and deploy our instruments - in this case, cohesion policy - far more efficiently towards genuinely sustainable development, and thirdly, that we must genuinely communicate with citizens from the outset.
I would particularly like to thank Commissioner Hübner.
Commissioner, you have made it clear that, together with this House, you are interested in the practical steps: the integrated approach, indicators which produce measurable outcomes, the definition of the territorial dimension, the Green Paper.
I think we will particularly need your help in ensuring that the Council is on board.
Again, I think it is regrettable that no one from the Council is present at this important debate.
The conclusions drawn in these two reports must lead to an amendment of the Lisbon Strategy and must genuinely underpin the new Community objective, the territorial dimension, in practical terms; otherwise, they will be nothing but empty words.
Let me make one final appeal to my fellow Members before the vote: let us be practical.
Let's not only review and analyse again; let's make it a condition that we demand the integrated approach for the provision of funding from the Structural Funds, and let us establish clear commitments for the reduction of greenhouse gases as well.
Climate protection must be implemented in the cities; otherwise, all our pledges at European and national level have no value at all.
<D>
(SK) Many of us will probably talk about healthcare subsidiarity in connection with the pharmaceutical package.
Nevertheless, the situation on the pharmaceutical market indicates that, for Europe to be competitive in research and development, as well as in the distribution and sale of new medicines, closer cooperation or improved cooperation between the Member States is required in this field.
Patients need to be better informed about medicines and of course about their unwanted side effects, so that they can participate in treatment more effectively.
Due to limited funding for pharmaceutical research and development in Europe, the European pharmaceutical industry is unable to compete with America, Japan or Canada.
That is why medicine prices have been rising disproportionately on European markets.
We have discussed repeatedly in the European Parliament the insufficient accessibility of certain drugs, for example those for the treatment of cancer or so-called rare diseases.
We place patients who are already in a difficult situation in the position of beggars who have to find sponsors in order to obtain treatment.
The high price of many medicines forces the healthcare sector to seek cheaper alternatives, in other words generic medicines.
Unfortunately, it is precisely these that are frequently counterfeited and often contain no active substance apart from sugar and the tablet compound.
The aforementioned facts show us how important it is to exchange opinions, discuss and subsequently adopt a complete pharmaceutical package ensuring that patients are treated with high-quality and affordable medicines.
In this context, I am looking forward to effective cooperation with the rapporteurs appointed for specific parts of the package in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection.
I have to agree with the Commissioner that it is medicines sold via the Internet that greatly endanger the safety of pharmaceutical policy.
<D>
rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your contribution to this debate.
You may ask what our final objectives are with this directive.
They are, of course, to improve the quality of bodies of surface water.
We do not want to find any more lead, cadmium, nickel, mercury, solvents or other highly toxic and carcinogenic substances such as PCBs in our waters.
Mrs Lienemann referred to a news report a fortnight ago that showed that PCBs were bio-accumulated in fish and that man then ate those fish.
We can no longer accept such a situation, and I believe that the citizens of Europe may also expect Europe to send out a strong signal that it is protecting our environment, protecting our health.
I believe that we will be able to get that European message across if we respect this framework directive on water, together with its daughter directives.
Some Members have said that not enough substances were listed, that Parliament had backtracked in relation to the first reading.
At first reading we had proposed 33 + 28 substances in total, i.e. 61 analysed substances.
At second reading, we have a total of 33 + 13, i.e. 46, but we must point out that these are hazardous substances of particular concern that should no longer occur in river waters today.
The other point of interest in this directive is that it allows us to check compliance with European legislation - I am thinking here of the implementation of the REACH regulation and of the IPPC.
We now have an instrument to verify that.
The Commissioner has heard my colleagues say that if the Council and Parliament approve this text, the ball is in its court.
It has an enormous amount of work to do, it has a great many analyses to conduct and inventories to draw up.
I wish it all the best.
In any case, we will continue to monitor this legislation.
<D>
(RO) I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Dumitriu.
The agricultural sector is important for the Member States' economies because it provides food for the population, agricultural products for export, not to mention a large number of jobs.
The European Union must be able to provide sufficient quantities of food for its population at affordable prices.
It is obvious that in a competitive market, information provision and promotion measures for agricultural products on the internal market and in third countries are becoming increasingly important.
Professional associations or organisations must be consulted when it comes to drawing up the programmes for promoting agricultural products.
I believe that this regulation will encourage European farmers to promote their agricultural products.
Romania has a huge number of agri-food products which we do not, unfortunately, come across on European markets, even though many of them are environmentally friendly.
A campaign to promote these products will benefit both European consumers and Romanian agricultural producers.
Particularly at times of economic crisis, the agricultural sector obviously remains one of the sectors which must be given special attention, along with adequate programmes and funding.
In a crisis situation, Member States must focus greater attention when setting their priorities.
This is why I believe that agriculture must remain an area which is supported because it is important for the European economy.
<D>
Mr President, I raise an issue on behalf of Mrs Marina Litvinenko, whose husband, Alexander Litvinenko, was murdered in London in December 2006.
The murder weapon was polonium-210, a radioactive material, 97% of which is manufactured in the Avangard nuclear facility in Russia.
The murder has all the hallmarks of a highly sophisticated assassination, such as those carried out by the Russian security services.
The chief suspect in the case, Mr Andrei Lugovoi, is a Member of the Russian Parliament and cannot be extradited under the Russian Constitution.
If I may address myself to Mrs Ferrero-Waldner directly: Mrs Litvinenko asks that the Council and the Commission raise the issue of Mr Litvinenko's murder with President Medvedev during the summit.
Mrs Litvinenko wants the murder of her husband to be solved and those concerned brought to justice.
The summit is an ideal opportunity to move that process forward.
Please assist her.
(Applause)
<D>
(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, I should like to congratulate you on your dedication, and, of course, I should like to congratulate the rapporteurs and especially Mrs Trautmann, who has worked extremely hard to reach this consensus, which she wanted to be neutral and to have no sectoral distinction.
However, as regards rights to use spectrum, it should be noted that investment and depreciation cycles differ from one sector to the next.
However, the provisions of the text on the allocation and harmonisation of frequencies and licences place satellite operators in a situation of legal uncertainty given the specific nature of their sector.
The new Article 8a, proposed by the rapporteur, does provide certain guarantees, but the wording of this clause must be tightened up in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity and ITU rules.
A number of questions also remain open regarding the substance and scope of the Commission's negotiating mandate.
Regarding Mr Harbour's report, I should like to raise the issue of the definition of 'publicly available telephone service', as laid down in Article 1, point 2b.
This definition should apply only to two-way services, in accordance with the definition given in the Privacy Directive.
Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and games consoles are in no way comparable to traditional telephony services.
Their assimilation as such would create a regulatory framework that inhibits innovation and provides uninformed users with tools that they do not see as being intended for certain uses, for example, the possibility of making an emergency call from a games console which can establish one-way communication.
It is therefore important to limit the definition to two-way services.
Regarding copyright, I should like to endorse the comments made by all my colleagues who have raised this issue.
<D>
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for some hours the official Chinese propaganda has been saying that the situation in Tibet is under control again.
These statements, as we know, conceal a bloody repression.
The reaction of the European authorities is doubly appalling.
Firstly, although we must welcome the fact that President Sarkozy is becoming increasingly vocal and is not excluding boycotting the Olympic Games, the attitude of his Foreign Affairs Minister is more than questionable.
Bernard Kouchner has on several occasions used the expression 'our Chinese friends'.
Does he know that this bloody dictatorship is trampling over human rights and threatening the Tibetan national identity?
Does he know how many political prisoners there are, the youngest in the world being the Panchen Lama?
We have to wonder: is it still right for him to talk about human rights on behalf of the country?
Since the Han Dynasty, the Chinese have believed that they are superior to the rest of the world.
The Communist regime has only served to exacerbate this attitude by advocating an ideology that suppresses all individual and social demands and, in particular, all national demands.
In Asia as in Europe, empires and ethnicism are the enemies of the nation.
That is the second reason why I am appalled.
The European leaders are guilty of a wait-and see attitude in relation to the Tibetan crisis: they who without even thinking recognised Kosovo's independence a few weeks ago.
By imposing the pure, simple and immediate independence of this Serbian province, home of Serbia's historical and spiritual cradle, Europeans and Americans have risked provoking serious reactions and developing an inconsistent international policy.
The policies on Kosovo and Tibet give the impression of unacceptable 'double standards', which destroy public faith in diplomatic action.
In conclusion, if we do not take account of national heritage and traditions, if we do not ensure fair treatment of people's rights, we run the risk of seeing our proclamations on human rights being mere incantations devoid of any meaning.
I therefore say: long live the Europe of free nations, long live the free Tibet and long live a world of free nations!
<D>
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mrs Beer on an excellent and timely report.
This is the year of all nuclear debates.
The US is preparing its nuclear posture review, NATO is reviewing its strategic concept and the world is getting ready for the 2010 NPT review conference.
All of this is happening in a special context.
The US is once again being led by a President, Barack Obama, who espouses the vision of a world without nuclear weapons.
This is not the time for timidity or hesitation.
Our voters would not understand if this Parliament prepared a report on the NPT which was less ambitious than that of the current US Administration.
Of course, US leadership on this issue is welcome.
After all, the US and Russia are the undisputed global nuclear hegemons.
However, Europe cannot sit passively by while Moscow and Washington discuss its strategic future.
We need to present our own NPT narrative, based on a strict balance between the non-proliferation and disarmament agendas.
This is what this report is all about and this is the spirit of the Socialist plenary amendments.
Why not support the Model Nuclear Weapons Convention and the Hiroshima-Nagasaki Protocol, both of which are promoted globally by civil organisations and political leaders?
It is our role as parliamentarians, unencumbered by the weight and limitations of executive power, to show our governments, and therefore the Council, the way in this field.
I hope the House can support the PSE amendments.
<D>
Mr President, although there is much good in this report, there is something I totally disagree with, as my colleagues, Mr Kaczmarek and Mr Mitchell have already done.
I start by asking you, Mr President, who said this: 'Through the practice of prenatal sex selection, countless women are denied the right even to exist.'
It might surprise the rapporteur of this report to know that it was said by Ban Ki-moon in his opening address to the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women, in New York.
Furthermore, according to the UNFPA, in its state of the world population report last year, there is a global deficit of 60 million women in the world - that is the whole population of the United Kingdom!
These missing females have been prenatally sex-selected, aborted and 'infanticised' out of existence, and this is happening on the continent on which I was born; I know what I am talking about.
How is it that a report of the European Parliament on gender equality can be silent on the deliberate elimination on the basis of gender alone?
Where is the equality in that?
I tabled an amendment to this report demanding a gender analysis of all abortions performed in the world, and guess what happened?
The Socialists voted against it!
Why?
Do we not have the right to know how women are being aborted before they are born?
We will see later today how they vote on Amendment 11.
I do not know why the rapporteur has insisted on squandering this valuable opportunity to remove the most significant cause of injustice against women in the world today - their basic right to life - and, instead, insist on perpetuating through championing the so-called rights of sexual...
(The President cut off the speaker.)
<D>
In the cohesion policy debate, I should like to draw your attention to some issues raised by Mr Roszkowski's report on the matter.
1.
In the Financial Perspective 2007-2013, the European Agriculture Fund for Rural Development was made the second pillar of the CAP and was thereby separated from cohesion policy.
As a result of this development, particularly in view of the slender budget funds available, cohesion policy, particularly that of the European Regional Development Fund, has focused on economic competitiveness concentrated in the larger urban centres or the most active regions, while the EAFRD is concentrating its resources on improving agricultural competitiveness.
This approach may result either in the duplication of some objectives, for example environmental protection, education and culture, or their omission in both areas.
2.
Therefore, we need to assess whether the funding designated for rural development in 2007-2013 should be used more to support farmers, or whether it will be assigned more to non-farming rural beneficiaries, or even beneficiaries who remain in rural areas but will move from the farming sector to other areas of professional activity.
If it turns out that support for farmers is the preferred objective of the second pillar, it appears that in the next perspective it would be favourable to tie these funds in to cohesion policy.
3.
It is also necessary to increase the funding pot for the second pillar of the CAP, albeit, as called for by the European Parliament, through a reduction in direct payments to large farmers, and a gradual increase in modulation rates.
<D>
Madam President, a humanitarian disaster is currently taking place in the north of Sri Lanka that is receiving relatively little attention.
The Sri Lankan army is carrying out attacks on the civilian population that could even be described as massacres.
A hospital has even come under fire and, according to humanitarian organisations, the overall situation is disastrous.
The Red Cross has raised the alarm.
The situation in Sri Lanka has escalated, and the European Union is not blameless in this, having torpedoed the negotiations that were held under the leadership of Norway by placing the LTTE on the EU list of terrorist organisations.
This meant that negotiations within the European Union were no longer possible.
In Sri Lanka itself, freedom of the press no longer exists.
Recently, a journalist was killed.
The German ambassador, who spoke at his funeral, was described by the President as someone who should leave the country.
All he had done was to describe the situation accurately.
There is talk of thousands of refugees in the north, and I must make it quite clear that the whole situation there is one on which we should be focusing much more attention.
The European Union should be coming out very much more clearly against what the Sri Lankan Government is currently doing.
The attacks by both the Sri Lankan army and the LTTE are wrong; it is clear that it is mainly civilians who are being hit.
We need to help the people trapped in the north and to achieve an immediate cease-fire, as it is quite clear that very large numbers of civilians are being killed there.
This is unacceptable, and the European Union shares the blame for this if it fails to state much more clearly that the support for the Sri Lankan Government must end.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I think these are very timely questions and this is a very important debate.
The Commission is now finalising the second Strategic Energy Review, which is also based on the debates in this House.
I expect that this second Strategic Energy Review will be adopted in November, and it will particularly cover the issues that we have been addressing today.
Definitely there is a limit to what we can propose in the strategic energy review due to the Lisbon Treaty ratification, because there is an energy article that would give much more opportunity to streamline the response.
But still we can do quite a lot.
The Commission shares the opinion that oil prices are likely to remain high in the medium and long term.
The justification for this type of prognosis is volatility in daily markets.
Even if now, the oil price is USD 106 or USD 110 per barrel, which is much lower than it was some time ago, at USD 145, the daily volatility still makes the situation relatively difficult to predict, and it is definitely making a major, wide-ranging impact and deserves a response.
While there is clearly a need for short-term action by Member States to mitigate the impact on the most vulnerable households, the main policy response should aim at facilitating our transition towards clearly more sustainable ways of producing and consuming energy.
In other words, to pursue our aim of becoming a low-carbon and energy-efficient economy.
In order to do so it will be vital to take forward the Commission's proposals on climate and energy policy, following up on the political commitments of the European Council.
On the structural reforms.
It is important to underline that we are facing an energy price increase, not only for oil: it also goes for coal, it also goes for gas and, as a result, it also has an impact on electricity prices.
Links between these prices are related by pricing structure: for example, gas contracts often use oil price benchmarks; gas-fired electricity generation is increasingly marginal and thus price-setting.
So I think it is very important to address not only issues about oil prices but all the sectors.
The situation clearly reinforces the need for encouraging competition throughout the whole energy sector.
That is why, again, I would like to underline the importance of swiftly reaching an agreement on the third internal energy market package.
Europe can and must develop its own strengths to deal with the fast-changing global energy economy.
A well-functioning, fully interconnected and competitive EU-wide internal market is a response.
This will diminish European vulnerability to energy-supply disruption and facilitate our cooperation with energy producer and transit countries.
Solidarity between Member States in crises will be enabled by European networks.
On European energy oil stocks, we have now prepared legislation that will clearly address two things: one, that these oil stocks will be always available at moments of crisis and can be easily used; and second, it is issues of precedence addressed, it is transparency and reporting on a weekly basis on commercial stocks.
In this respect, even though we are not the biggest oil consumer in the world, we are able to influence transparency in the market and diminish volatility and the level of speculation in the market.
Speculation is definitely an issue.
We have done an analysis.
The available evidence suggests that supply and demand are the main drivers of oil prices, and that these fundamentals are set to underpin high prices in the future.
But, at the same time, we will continue our work on analysing what impact speculation has at a particular moment and whether there is really the ability to diminish volatility and have more supervision in the energy market.
In any case, it is very clear that transparency in oil markets, both in terms of contracts and related financial instruments and fundamentals, is a must.
I would also like to say that both Commission and national competition authorities are acting against anti-competitive behaviour.
This is a way in which we can pass the changes in oil prices to the consumers, because consumers use refined products.
The Commission will make additional efforts in this respect - we are following this issue - and a lot of competition authorities in member countries have already started investigations into the issue of how soon and how fast the oil price changes are being passed to the consumers.
At the same time it is very clear that there are differences between different member countries, because there are different sourcing strategies for the companies concerned.
Also, in some countries there are biofuel blends that also influence the velocity of the possibility to change prices according to the oil price.
Nevertheless, it should be very clearly in the focus of attention in all anti-trust authorities.
Energy efficiency, renewables and diversification: it is very clear that our main lines are in our energy and climate policy, and it will be prominent in our Strategic Energy Review.
There is already a substantial European legal framework in place.
In addition, there are many actions being pursued under the current Energy Efficiency Action Plan, including also legislative initiatives and studies.
And there are also support actions, for example under the Intelligent Energy Europe programme.
Regarding existing EU legislation, it is implementation that is very essential.
The ambitious 2020 target for energy savings cannot be met without adequate transposition by Member States.
The Commission is vigorously pursuing infringement procedures to ensure that member countries are really implementing their existing EU legisaltion.
This year the Commission also will adopt an energy efficiency package.
This will include a communication with a comprehensive overview of the Commission's ambitions for energy effciency, as well as legislative and policy initiatives - in particular, prominent proposals for an ambitious recast of the Directive on the energy performance of buildings; also for a modification of the Energy Labelling Directive, to ensure more effective and dynamic labelling.
Needless to say, continued high energy prices further support the need for action in this area.
And also we get clear involvement of the European Investment Bank in this area.
The European Council, when analysing the appropriate responses to the high oil price situation, underlines the importance of a sustainable and adequate tax framework.
There is considerable scope for the EU and its Member States to make more systematic and effective use of taxation to encourage energy savings.
The Commission intends to present proposals and recommendations on the cost-effective use of taxation and specific tax incentives, including reduced VAT, to promote the demand and supply of energy-efficient goods and services.
Furthermore, in its review of the Energy Tax Directive, the Commission will look at how it can better support the EU's energy and climate policy, encouraging energy efficiency and emission reductions.
More widespread and systematic use of road pricing, in line with the principles of the Commission's 'Greening Transport' Communication, would also encourage a shift to more energy-efficient transparency rules.
On financing alternative energy technologies and research, let me draw your attention to the fact that we are in the process of preparing a communication on financing low-carbon technologies as a follow-up to the European Strategic Energy Technology Plan.
The Communication will analyse the resource needs for long-term research and development, large-scale demonstration projects and the early-stage commercialisation phase.
We are considering measures that best use public investment to leverage additional private investment, such as the creation of a specific facility for large-scale demonstration projects.
This could be built on existing instruments such as the Risk Sharing Financing Facility, a joint initiative of the Commission and the European Investment Bank.
The Commission also encourages Member States to use national resources, for example potential resources that could be raised through the auctioning of CO2 allowances in the revised ETS schemes.
On energy security and foreign policy aspects, I come back to the idea that Europe can and must reinforce its own strengths to deal with the fast-changing global energy economy.
Internal and external policy in energy work together.
The stronger a common European energy market is, the stronger it will be towards external energy suppliers.
We are pursuing diversification with countries like Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Egypt, Iraq, Nigeria, but it is clear that we also encourage predictable relations with current suppliers like Russia, and definitely we are looking very much at the possibility that Norway could increase supply to the market, because it is very clear that the EU market is attractive for suppliers, and we should not be afraid that we will run out of gas, but we should really work for competitive supplies to the European market and not be in a situation where we could be blackmailed on prices.
Regarding the issue of assistance to oil-importing developing countries.
Given the strong impact of access and price of energy on development and global climate change, energy cooperation is increasingly important throughout our development assistance activities.
It was a central theme of my joint visit with Commissioner Michel to the African Union and a number of African countries earlier this month.
We invest substantial resources in supporting movement of these countries, not only to eliminate energy poverty, but to power themselves with clean and new energy sources.
On macroeconomic and social aspects, the increase in oil price levels certainly put a strain on consumers and certain sectors of the economy which face difficult adjustment processes.
More immediately, most member countries have undertaken - or are currently considering - short-term measures in response to the recent surge in energy prices.
In line with the European Council conclusions, most of these policies focus on vulnerable households.
Some Member States have also implemented or discussed temporary measures targeted at specific sectors.
As high energy prices are expected to prevail in the long term, it is essential that the policy measures aim at facilitating the structural shift to more sustainable patterns of production, transport and consumption.
This also points to the significance of flexible product and labour markets and the Lisbon agenda, and to the importance of the transition towards a low-carbon and highly energy-efficient economy.
But I believe there is clearly not one answer to these issues.
Still, the framework that we propose with the energy and climate change package and the internal energy market package is a backbone, because, the sooner it is adopted, the stronger we will be, and also there will be more competition and lower prices for consumers.
At the same time we should be open and honest and say to the people: do not expect oil prices to come back to USD 20 per barrel.
That means each of us also should change our behaviour, because part of the issue is also our behaviour, and I believe that we should really pay true attention in our everyday lives.
<D>
Mr President, you will not be surprised if I express concern about the thrust of the reports relating to ESDP, in particular Mr von Wogau's report, which is full of false assumptions concerning the nature of the European Union and the ambition to create a European army under EU control.
It sees, and I quote this expression, 'Synchronised Armed Forces Europe' as a step on the way to 'an integrated European Armed Force'.
Surely, in other words, a European army.
As we all know, ESDP produces no military added value.
It is a political tool in the advancement of an integrated Europe.
It should be seen for what it is.
For a long time, I have argued that the European Union could play a useful role in providing civil instruments for crisis management and post-conflict reconstruction.
This would actually be helpful.
By the way, no military officers that I know imagine that conflicts such as Afghanistan can be tackled by military means alone.
There is nothing new in what is now fashionably called 'the comprehensive approach'.
We used to call it 'hearts and minds'.
So it is quite wrong - a deceit in fact - for the EU to try and justify its involvement in military matters by claiming the comprehensive approach somehow rather for itself - some sort of EU-unique selling point.
For the EU, the honest and sensible approach would be to drop the defence ambition from ESDP and to concentrate on its civil contribution.
Then, perhaps, Europe and her allies would be able to focus on their military contributions to NATO, revitalising the transatlantic alliance for the difficult years ahead, without being distracted by the EU's duplicative agenda.
The immediate problem is that the EU's ambitions are now beginning to contaminate NATO, and I am seriously concerned that this will affect the way the 60th anniversary goes.
Meanwhile, back in the UK, we have government ministers in a state of denial that any of this is happening.
<D>
(PT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by congratulating Mr Stockmann on his openness and readiness to compromise during the preparation of this excellent report, which will directly apply to airports with over five million passengers and, in particular, to the airports of Faro and Lisbon in my country.
This proposal must be adopted by this Parliament and by the Council because it guarantees non-discrimination in airport charges, except where necessary and compatible with the Treaty.
A compulsory procedure for consultation between airport managing bodies and airport users should be put in place.
Any differences in charges will be transparent and based on clear criteria.
Airports will levy the same charge for the same service, although discounts may be granted to airport users based on the quality of a service used, provided that all airport users can benefit from this discount under public, transparent and objective conditions.
Discounts may also be granted to users who open new routes in accordance with competition law.
A national independent supervisory authority should be established which will intervene in the event of disagreement over a charging decision.
Incentives should be permitted for the launch of new routes linking the least-favoured and outermost regions.
Finally, Member States should be able to authorise the managing body responsible for an airport network to introduce a charging system common to this network.
Madam President, with this new directive, future airport charges levied at our airports, and even in outermost regions such as the one that I come from, will guarantee universal access for all to air transport.
This is particularly important in a region such as mine where air transport is the only way of arriving or departing.
That is why I hope that this proposal will be adopted tomorrow and that the Commission and the Council will duly accept it.
<D>
Mr President, when we leave this place this evening, most of us will take a black car.
These are quality cars and quality drivers, and we know that those drivers are very professional.
It is a known quality.
They meet the criteria.
Although I partly agree with the English gentleman a while ago when he complained about too much legislation - sometimes it is true that we do produce too much legislation - I still regret that EU access to professional rules was not extended to taxis, because we all use taxis in the various Member States and their quality differs a great deal.
When you take a taxi, reliability is very important, as is quality: knowing what to expect.
It is also a question of safety.
You are very often alone in the car in strange surroundings.
The taxi is also, for many of us, the first contact we have in a new country, so it would make sense for the drivers to meet certain European criteria.
It also means that, if they were professional, well educated and knew where they were going, we would not have to be afraid of overcharging.
There are countries like Germany, Sweden, Slovenia and Finland where the national rules are very stringent on this issue and the taxi profession works well.
London taxis are also known for their quality.
We should share these best practices.
But, in the mean time, while we are waiting for this legislation on criteria for the taxi profession, maybe we should legislate for us to give good tips to those drivers who take us home in the evenings.
<D>
(DE) Mr President, I would like to make a similar proposal.
I am astonished that the right of minorities is being deployed in such moralistic terms.
There are around seven Jewish festive days which cannot be observed because they are working days.
The same applies to 13 Protestant festive days as well.
The constituent sitting is being held on 14 July.
This is one of the most important secular holidays.
Can we work in France on 14 July as we commemorate the French Revolution?
I think that is impossible and inappropriate.
That needs to be changed as well, please!
(Applause)
<D>
in writing. - (GA) I wish to suggest that the Committee on Regional Development take initiatives and exert pressure for action enabling ability to be pooled in a European grouping of territorial cooperation with a view to bringing policies to light.
The new EGTCs will serve to enforce legislation in Member States, generate new dynamics in cross-border cooperation, and enable a higher degree of confidence and cooperation to be maintained beyond the limits of borders.
In my divided country a key role could be played by initiatives of this kind and other EU support schemes aimed at mitigating the adverse impact of partition on Ireland.
I fully support the sound thinking behind cross-border cooperation, as this is a European ideal.
There is a great need for Ireland to explore every avenue for cross-border cooperation because our border areas are in poor counties and the level of development is low.
We have spent a long time dawdling and making excuses.
Member States have a duty to help border areas to implement the ECTC legislation as quickly as possible
<D>
A staggering 5.5 million young people, or 21.4% of all young people under 25, are currently unemployed.
This is almost double the average unemployment rate.
In the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, Mrs Turunen's practical proposals come not a day too soon.
We must prevent the social exclusion of a whole generation of young people and the jeopardising of Europe's economic and social future.
After four months' unemployment, young people should have the right to a job or paid apprenticeship, training, or a combination of the two.
There should be a quality charter to ensure that apprenticeships provide a reasonable income and are of limited duration.
In addition, the resolution calls for 10% of the European Social Fund to be reserved for projects helping young people to find work.
Moreover, the European Commission should ensure that existing legislation in the various Member States does not discriminate against young people and guarantees them access to social advantages in terms of employment.
Long-term unemployment at a young age has a pernicious effect on a person's self-confidence and optimism for the future.
Addressing this is an important task for responsible politicians.
<D>
(NL) Mr President, we are once again discussing the transport of animals in this House, and we will once again reach a two-fold conclusion.
Firstly, current legislation is lagging far behind Parliament's ambitions as set out in the report of my predecessor Albert Jan Maat, who, to my mind, was right to draw a distinction between animals intended for slaughter and other cattle.
Indeed, steps have been taken in the area of training drivers, better transport conditions and the use of GPS, but these are certainly not enough.
Secondly, monitoring remains the Achilles' heel of this legislation.
Monitoring by Europe leaves something to be desired and is still very much organised at national level.
There is an urgent need, therefore, for agreements on handling complaints and gathering evidence across borders.
I should also like to see the Food and Veterinary Office step up its monitoring efforts.
My amendment to make more funds available for this in the budgetary procedure has been rejected by, inter alia, the European Commission.
Even now, the European Commission refers to national reports which it will be assessing on paper.
Would the European Commission prefer to wash its hands of this matter than to guarantee actual European-wide monitoring, ad hoc inspections by European inspectors and European supervision?
Other improvements that need to be made to current legislation are: more and better-equipped resting places within the European Union and beyond, more specific climate conditions for the different animal species and, finally, we have to start working on the compulsory use of satellite systems, with access by authorised personnel to a central database.
Despite an incomplete European overview of the actual implementation of this legislation, we do, of course, pick up certain rumours, from Austria for example, where a local inspector reportedly sees many empty lorries drive in the direction of Poland and the Czech Republic, for example, but he does not see the full vehicles returning, heading towards southern Europe.
Does this mean that, once these lorries are full, they decide to make a detour around Austria, perhaps to avoid the stricter monitoring rules that are in place there in comparison with the surrounding countries?
For me, that is an indication that the legislation is being applied very differently by the Member States.
Another problem is the role of the vets who need to sign for transport.
Commissioner, in some cases, these vets have become nothing but stamp machines.
Surely nobody in their right mind could sign off a transport schedule for horses from Romania to southern Italy that was due to last 24 hours?
The last 500 km of this transport would, according to the transport schedule, take 2.5 hours.
This makes you wonder whether these animals were to be transported in a Ferrari.
Finally, young animals, particularly puppies, for example, are now being ferried across the whole of Europe without there being any legislation in place.
I would therefore like to urge the European Commission to look into this.
We have done our homework in this House; we are now looking forward to the Commission proposals that we expect before the forthcoming elections for this House.
<D>
Madam President, the financial crisis rages on and euro-zone countries are facing recession.
The answer, we are repeatedly told, is that we need more regulation to make the financial sector work better.
But we have a problem now, and changing the rules after the problem has arisen is not going to help us with that problem.
I urge Members to consider a completely different reaction to the current economic difficulties.
They are a signal that we cannot continue as we are and that, thanks to borrowing that has been too cheap and imports that have been too cheap, we have all been living above our means and we cannot go on consuming at the same rate.
Adjustment will be painful, but it is necessary, and in these hard times there is another message that is even more salient but will not be heard in these institutions.
It is that the EU cannot continue with its massive legislative programmes in the name of health and safety, consumer protection, social equality, for instance, for the overriding effect of all these schemes is to add costs and to crush the productive activity on which our very prosperity depends.
In these hard times, the one message that should be heard is that European countries can no longer afford the European Union, its institutions and its immense outpourings of legislation.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - If you do not mind, I will start with the second question, because I have a more certain legislative base on which to answer you.
The Commission has already included, in the internal market for goods package, legislation containing a provision requiring economic operators to have available the identity of their supplier.
This will help to enhance the identification of the good and to have a clear label as to who the producer is, for one thing, and also who the supplier is.
The global chain is becoming longer and longer, and there is no longer any item which we can be absolutely certain has been produced only in one country.
I understand your question, but think that we also need to raise awareness and make parents more vigilant, because rogue traders will always exist.
We need to raise awareness as regards checking the retailer and only buying from a responsible retailer, and also as regards checking the labels on the product.
While nobody can remove that responsibility from our shoulders as consumers, I believe that your point is absolutely valid, and I agree that, not only the manufacturer's name, but also specific information should be shown on the label, especially in the case of toys.
This question is perhaps linked with the first one on what we can do about falsification - if I have understood your question correctly.
If the good is a fake good, that is one thing.
We need to tackle fake goods through intellectual property rights, and also through our custom activities.
I have to tell you that our customs authorities have raised the frequency of their checks three times higher than the world norm.
The advice from the World Custom Unions is to check 3% of goods at borders and ports, and in Europe we check 10%.
I also think it would be a good idea to enhance our research and development to make surveillance and checks at the borders even tighter, with better technical devices to conduct screenings and other important innovations that can be introduced at the borders for goods coming onto our markets.
I would like also to point out that even if the good is not counterfeit, and clearly shows the 'CE' mark, this will not mean that the good necessarily conforms to all the requirements within the framework of this directive.
We also need to keep, additionally, to these New Approach Directives, which set out requirements on how a good is produced, and to ensure constant market surveillance from the point of view of safety, because sometimes safety is even more important, or at least equally important, and does not always coincide with the manner in which the good is produced.
It might be, for example, as in the case of the problem with magnets in toys, to which we are responding, that when we see that the situation has changed we need to respond and take measures on the basis of safety, and not just on the basis of the requirements we have asked the producer to fulfil.
If we combine the two sets of requirements - on the producer and on the good once the market - then we will have better-protected consumers.
Subject: Profiteering by food shops
Most Member States experience considerable fluctuations in food prices, very often because shops are able to exploit periods of mass consumption, such as public holidays.
Milk, in particular, is a product with a constantly rising price in all Member States.
Does the Commission monitor the commercial activities of food shops and supermarkets during periods of higher consumption?
Is it collaborating with national consumer protection organisations to find an effective solution to profiteering?
<D>
President-in-Office of the Council. - In December 2008, the Poznań Conference agreed on a work programme for 2009, which clearly identified steps towards the Copenhagen Climate Conference to be held in December 2009.
Poznań has also sent the message that the current financial crisis is not to be seen as an obstacle to further action on climate change, but instead as yet another opportunity for transforming profoundly our economic system and moving toward a low-carbon economy.
That being said, we have to be aware that we will not have an easy time in doing so.
The economic downturn will affect the willingness of the stakeholders involved to absorb additional costs related to the reduction commitments, as well as mitigation and adaptation measures.
The Czech Presidency intends to pursue efforts at international level towards a successful agreement in Copenhagen in December.
As you know, as a follow-up to the Commission communication called 'Towards a Comprehensive Climate Change Agreement in Copenhagen' and on the basis of the input of the Temporary Committee on Climate Change set up by the European Parliament, the Council adopted conclusions on this issue last week, thereby further developing the EU position on a comprehensive post-2012 agreement.
The forthcoming European Council is also expected to agree key political messages.
In addition to the shared vision of the long-term action on mitigation and adaptation as well as technology, the identification of appropriate means for financing effective and long-term climate policies is key in the EU's position and will determine, to a large extent, the success of the Copenhagen Conference.
The EU has already started to engage in active outreach, not only with key negotiating partners and the main emerging economies, but also with the new US Administration, which has already signalled its readiness to engage again in a meaningful way.
The Presidency has had its first meeting with the new US Administration and plans to have further exchanges as soon as possible.
Climate change will be one of the topics discussed during the informal EU-US Summit in Prague on 5 April.
The first signals coming from Washington are, in any case, encouraging so it will be crucial to ensure good cooperation between the EU and the US in order for our positions to be as ambitious as possible and to ensure that, consequently, the major emerging economies will follow suit.
For the EU's efforts to fight climate change to deliver, it is absolutely crucial that we bring other major world CO2-producing economies on board.
It is for this reason that several of these countries have also been invited to the G8 meeting - South Africa, Egypt, China, India, Australia, Mexico, Brazil, Indonesia and South Korea.
As far as the climate and energy package is concerned, by reaching agreement on this package in December 2008, the EU sent a very strong political signal to all its negotiating partners in the world.
Now we will start its implementation, which involves a lot of technical work.
Aware of the need to determine in further detail the criteria which the European Union would wish to apply in deciding to move from a 20% to a 30% reduction, the Council is currently considering the issues of complementarity of effort and of the adequacy of possibly developing country actions on the basis of the Commission communication.
The relevant text is included in the Environment Council conclusions of 2 March 2009.
<D>
I have several things to say as we begin.
There are five brief points.
Thursday, 27 January, will mark the 66th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau German Nazi concentration and extermination camp.
Every year on this day, we honour the memory of the more than 1 million people who were murdered there.
This gives us the strength to work together to build a peaceful future for a united Europe, a Europe which will not experience such nightmares again.
Secondly, on 13 January, the people of Lithuania celebrated the 20th anniversary of 'Bloody Sunday', when the Soviet army tried to overthrow the democratically elected government of the independent Lithuania.
Lithuanians defended their liberty, and today enjoy equal rights as members of the Euro-Atlantic community.
In remembering this anniversary, an anniversary which is important for Europe, we express solidarity, today, with the people of Belarus, who are also our neighbours, and who are still waiting for freedom and democracy to come to their country.
Thirdly, on 23 December 2010, the European Union ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
The Convention, together with the European Commission's disability strategy, will enable equal civil, political and economic rights to be guaranteed by 2020 to the nearly 80 million citizens of the Union who are affected by some kind of disability.
Fourthly, I would also like to reiterate that we are seriously concerned by the disappearance of the Chinese lawyer, Gao Zhisheng.
According to the latest reports, he is being mistreated and subjected to torture.
The European Parliament has already taken up Mr Zhisheng's case several times.
Today, I would like to call upon the Chinese authorities to reveal the place where he is being detained and give details of his state of health.
Finally, since our last meeting before Christmas, the Belgian Presidency has ended, and the leadership of the European Union Council has been assumed by Hungary.
We are going to talk about both presidencies during this part-session of Parliament.
Since our last meeting, important political events have also taken place.
I am thinking of the election in Belarus and the recent clashes in Tunisia.
Both of these are on the order of business of our plenary part-session.
I would also like to remind everyone that several serious natural disasters struck in the last weeks of the Christmas period.
We sympathise with the victims' families, and we would like to express our condolences to them and to the governments of the countries affected.
<D>
(FR) Mr President, I would like to draw the attention of this House to the fate of two French journalists, Pierre Creisson and Thomas Dandois, who are currently in prison in Niger.
They are accused of undermining state security, which carries a possible death sentence in Niger.
There is no doubt that the two journalists and their driver, Al-Hassane, broke Niger laws by entering a prohibited area.
In my opinion, however, it was for sound journalistic reasons because their aim was to report on the Tuareg rebellion, and they also intended to return to the capital to question the Niger authorities so that they would have as broad a view as possible.
I therefore believe that it is essential for us to take action to help these two journalists: firstly, because they risk being sentenced to death, a punishment that is out of all proportion with their actions, and secondly, because Niger is considered to be a friend of ours and a country that we help a great deal.
It would not deserve the reputation that this attitude could generate.
I believe, Mr President, that you and my fellow Members could be of great assistance if you participate in this request for reflection, for clemency from President Tandja, so that these two journalists can be released.
Even though they did break Niger laws, their actions do not warrant such a long imprisonment.
<D>
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) I have just said that a proposal for a directive is currently under discussion between the Council and the European Parliament in which this issue is addressed.
Since the proposal for a directive has not yet been approved, I cannot say exactly what measures the directive will propose for defending and protecting the weakest individuals who need the most protection.
We shall see.
This proposal for a directive now addresses that concern to protect the weakest.
I can also clearly tell you that when we, the Portuguese Presidency, refer to the question of illegal immigration, we always say that the fight against it is based on two fundamental principles: solidarity and respect for people and respect for the humanitarian tragedy underlying the phenomenon.
We should not treat people as objects, and neither the Presidency nor Portugal accepts or has ever accepted that the humanitarian dimension should not be considered or should be considered to be secondary in these situations.
This is our position in principle as the Presidency, it is our position in principle as an EU Member State, and it is a position that we will not abandon under any circumstances.
Subject: European Security Strategy
What are the results to date of implementing the European Security Strategy?
In particular, what are the results of extending the security zone to include Europe's periphery?
Is the Council satisfied with the strategies 'Peace through regional integration' and 'Regional integration through peace' on the EU's geopolitical perimeter?
<D>
(ET) When I enter the Parliament building in Brussels in the mornings, Aung San Suu Kyi looks down at me with her sad eyes from a great placard and I must confess that every morning I feel embarrassingly powerless.
The resolutions which we have adopted almost unanimously have had no effect whatever.
Today when I heard both the Commission and the Council representatives speaking here I noticed the rhetoric: 'We hope, we wish, we consider, we are concerned'.
Is this not too demure an attitude to take in respect of a regime like this?
We must clearly speak with one voice, and do so much more forcefully.
How do we move forward?
We always come back to economic sanctions.
In my view this is clearly, however, the only way to influence this regime; we must of course monitor very carefully where our development aid goes.
Our money must be conditional upon very specific reforms in this society.
<D>
The own-initiative report recognises the fact that agriculture is of strategic importance in the context of global food security.
A glance into the future shows how urgent the need for action is.
By 2050, experts estimate that global demand for food will double.
Agriculture must be in a position to be able to meet the enormous needs of the growing population for safe and adequate food.
At the same time, the obstacles resulting from the limitation of natural resources, high energy prices and climate change need to be dealt with.
I supported the report, which clearly demonstrates that food security is a central concern in the European Union, too, and requires coordination of the individual policy areas.
Only if the areas of agricultural policy, development policy, trade policy, financial policy and energy policy, as well as research, work together can improvements be achieved.
Securing the incomes of farmers and an adequate supply of good quality food must therefore be key goals of the common agricultural policy.
The greatly fluctuating market prices in the agricultural sector are the result of crop failures, speculation and a concentration in trade, and these are significant uncertainty factors.
Interventions and stockpiling are the crisis mechanisms that will put a stop to market abuse and speculative transactions.
It is important that these market intervention mechanisms play a central role in the future common agricultural policy.
Another important point is the recommendation for the development of a global system of food stocks and emergency reserves.
<D>
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DA) Mr President, Commissioner, we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe have always wholeheartedly backed the EU transport strategy, which is aimed at strengthening rail transport, as regards both passenger transport and freight transport.
The best tools for this are liberalisation and freer competition, which causes train companies to take a greater interest in the wishes of customers.
Increased competition will pave the way for rail transport to become more competitive and financially sustainable, and at the same time we will secure equal competition in relation to other forms of transport.
Road taxes will naturally be looked at with this in mind.
This year the first railway package came into force with the liberalisation of freight transport, and this evening we will consider the compromise concerning the third railway package, which will introduce further liberalisation, albeit far less ambitiously than we in the ALDE Group would have liked.
On the other hand, passengers' rights have been secured, and an agreement has been reached concerning the common training of train drivers, who are, of course, a very important element in creating more efficient train operations across borders.
As my group's rapporteur on the Directive on the certification of onboard personnel, I would particularly like to thank rapporteur Mr Savary for the results that we have achieved.
My group has particularly emphasised the fact that a reasonable solution has been found as regards financing.
We are therefore glad that training costs will be refunded if a locomotive driver changes job shortly after completing his training.
This training is expensive, after all, and we must not create a system whereby some rail companies are freewheeling and systematically avoiding paying their fair share of training costs by recruiting newly trained staff from other companies.
With regard to the personnel to be covered, we are satisfied with the fact that train drivers will be covered initially, while the question of including other personnel involved in safety will be assessed again in 30 months' time.
It has been difficult to reach an agreement on which rail carriers should be covered by the passenger's rights.
In Parliament we have maintained that national transport - and not just the 5% of passenger transport that crosses borders - should be covered.
We succeeded in this, and a formula has also been found that ensures that passengers have fundamental rights.
This is important.
However, I have difficulty in understanding why passenger's rights cannot be extended to cover all rail operations.
The work relating to this legislation and Parliament's proposals concerning passenger rights has actually inspired the rail companies in my own country, Denmark, to voluntarily implement rules on passenger compensation.
This means that commuters are now also entitled to compensation when they are affected by delays, which does happen on occasion, of course.
Commuters are very important; we will secure good conditions and ensure that they experience rail transport as a good alternative to other, more energy-intensive forms of transport.
It has been very apparent during the negotiations that the desire to alter the framework conditions for rail companies in the EU brings out strong emotions.
On the one hand, we would all like to have more rail transport.
On the other, there is considerable concern that national companies will be unable to cope with the competition.
In addition, there is not always strong enthusiasm for change amongst either rail companies or trade unions.
However, there are also some rail companies that are taking up the challenge and modernising and creating new organisational forms that secure effective door-to-door transport through the use of several modes of transport.
This is the future too, of course.
As politicians, we will establish frameworks that ensure that those who wish to provide competitive, effective and modern transport services have the opportunity they need to deliver.
I fully understand those who are fighting to retain their old privileges, but this is simply not the agenda that we politicians must pursue.
We will secure attractive, effective and safe rail transport.
I feel that the result that we have achieved is a step forward, and I would like to thank all three rapporteurs for their efforts.
I would also like to thank Commissioner Barrot for his fundamental role in achieving a step along the path towards improving the efficiency of rail transport in Europe.
<D>
- Madam President, it is always a pleasure to be present with you in explanations of votes.
People will start to talk soon.
The current financial crisis has highlighted the problems of having such a long period for a financial framework.
Who, a couple of years ago, would have foreseen the extent of the damage caused by the credit crunch and its consequences?
I believe that this review gives us in this House a big opportunity and exposes a problem.
The problem exposed is one that, actually, we have created.
There is now a new industry that has been built in Brussels.
It is not a manufacturing industry, although it does create some jobs.
It is an industry driven by lobbyists and especially NGOs.
It is quite a sinister trade.
It is essentially self-perpetuating.
The Commission consults NGOs on a subject, the NGOs call for action, they lobby MEPs to give political support for this call, the Commission eventually runs a programme in the subject area and - yes, you've guessed it! - the NGOs who told the Commission this programme was needed bid to run the programme itself.
This was an opportunity wasted because we could have said that we are not going to do this in the future.
<D>
Madam President, I congratulate my colleague Ms Ana Gomes for her work and her comprehensive and realistic assessments.
As the report shows, China is already an important economic and political partner for Africa.
Regarding Africa's development, I believe that there is so much work to do on this continent and that China, as a new player, should be welcome to participate.
However, what I strongly fear is that instead of channelling its support in constructive endeavours - health, education, poverty reduction and infrastructure - China would continue to engage in feeding the tragedies of the continent and will do it by arms trafficking and undermining whatever steps African countries make towards democracy, good governance and respect for human rights.
The Chinese ship carrying guns for Zimbabwe again calls into question China's real commitment to contributing to peace and security in Africa.
Many African countries welcome their cooperation with China as there is no political conditionality linked to the economic benefits, but the EU should continue to strongly advocate, both to China and the African countries, institution building, human rights advancement and more transparent rules regarding the exploitation of natural resources.
Recent developments have shown that, even in those cases where in the last couple of years governments started to show more openness on how public money and resources were spent, they have gone back to a less transparent administration.
The EU has the duty to help China to become a trusted partner in development cooperation.
<D>
People from rural communities are in a particularly disadvantaged position when competing in the labour market.
In the European Union, and especially in Poland, there are significant differences in the standard of living between urban and rural areas.
This is especially true of access to services.
Access to modern technologies like broadband Internet in rural areas in Poland is half that of urban areas.
The objective of cohesion policy should be to undertake specific initiatives to equalise standards of living in particular regions.
Aid for small and medium-sized businesses in obtaining funding from the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development is extremely important here.
Governments of particular countries should support small and medium-sized enterprises by eliminating administrative and legal barriers and by providing suitable infrastructure.
These are fundamental conditions for the development of areas which are distant from large urban areas.
<D>
(PL) Madam President, we have been recalling examples of disasters - ones that are known throughout Europe.
I am from Poland, a country that recently commemorated another anniversary of the deaths of dozens of people on board the ferry Jan Heweliusz.
Safety is of crucial importance.
It is good that we are looking at safety as part of a package.
It is a good package, numerically good, with seven regulations.
The safety of people, ships, waters and even the safety of economic trade should be, and is, reflected in this package.
In this regard I consider Mr Sterckx's report, for which I had the honour of being the rapporteur's auxiliary, to be a particularly good one.
Yes, monitoring of ships must be carried out.
Mrs Wortmann-Kool is right to say that we need to investigate the causes of potential disasters and prevent disasters from happening.
Moreover, I am of the view that for sailing we should refer to the situation in aviation, in other words investigate near collision situations, because we could gain a better understanding of the mechanisms and causes of the occurrence of hazards.
I do not understand and am far from being able to agree with the position taken by Mr Zīle, who spoke of special, or specific, treatment for small states.
Surely the size of an EU Member State has little to do with the numbers of vessels flying its flag.
<D>
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking all the rapporteurs who have contributed to this discharge procedure.
I would like to use the two minutes available to me to discuss the Commission's discharge report drawn up by Mr Jørgensen.
The Court of Auditors published its report last November and that report was considerably better than in previous years, owing to the fact that this time, the report cited percentages.
This should be continued in future reports.
When the report was published, it was almost as if the Commission had triumphed.
The report had never been so good.
The Court of Auditors approved 44% of the Commission's expenditure.
I must say that I did not feel this was the time to sit back contently and say: 'This is the best we have ever done'.
No, we can do much better.
What is striking is that the Commission actually disregarded Parliament's recommendations in previous discharge resolutions.
What has been significant for Parliament over the past three years?
The national declarations.
What does the Commission say?
We will not respect the national declarations.
This is too much.
Furthermore, this is included in the financial perspective, in an interinstitutional agreement.
Fortunately, the Commission has retraced its footsteps and this will now take place.
There is a second issue, however.
The Commissioners cannot countersign the declarations of the Directors-General.
It puzzles me why that is so.
We can receive the Commissioners in the Committee on Budgetary Control, as offered by the Commission, and regularly hear their views with regard to how much progress has been made, yet the Commissioners are not permitted to sign anything with Parliament.
How can this be explained from a legal perspective?
I can only say, Mr President, that we hope that next year will be even better.
The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe will adopt a constructive attitude in all of this, as it has in the past.
<D>
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Mr President, on behalf of my group I, too, would like to congratulate the citizens of the nine new Member States on the present that the Portuguese Presidency will be giving them on 21 and 22 December.
I am in complete agreement with the Minister and the Presidency, who are indeed dismantling the last remains of the Iron Curtain.
The free movement of citizens without internal borders is a very positive thing and one of the most important freedoms of the European Union, and I welcome the fact that the inhabitants of the nine new Member States will now be able to enjoy it.
The Schengen Agreement, however, concerns more than just the removal of internal borders.
It also means that the external borders of the Union must now be monitored by these new countries, in the interest of all the other Member States.
It is very important that the expansion of the Schengen area does not jeopardise our security.
Mr Frattini and the Minister have both said the same.
Efficient and effective border controls are therefore essential.
The assessment of the Council and the Commission show that the nine countries are in principle ready to take on this task, but that improvements could be made in a number of areas, for example as regards staffing and airport infrastructure, and our curiosity has been aroused as to the evaluations and monitoring that will appear as a result.
We hope, too, that Parliament will be swiftly informed about this.
Schengen of course relates to much more than border controls.
It implies greater police and judicial cooperation between Schengen countries.
We are glad that in the case of these nine Member States the Portuguese Presidency has found a solution with a sort of SIS 1+, although we maintain that progress must be made as soon as possible on SIS II.
I am happy with Mr Frattini's promise to have it by December 2008, and naturally we will hold him to that.
We understand that Bulgaria and Romania still have to wait a number of years, but we also hope that these countries will continue to work hard, with our help, so that in a few years they can also join the Schengen area.
The same applies to Cyprus.
It is a shame that the problem that has been holding the country back for so long is now also preventing it from joining the Schengen area.
That is another argument for working together to find a solution to the problem that has affected this country for too long already.
In other areas, too, for example in relations with Turkey, this question leads to problems.
Naturally a solution is also necessary for the people of Cyprus themselves.
Finally, I want to refer again to yesterday's discussion.
It has rightly been indicated that the enlargement of the Schengen area and the entire Schengen system requires mutual solidarity between the Member States.
As I have already said, controlling the external borders is a task that affects all our security and in which the nine countries concerned are now involved.
We will now speak to them about this.
That security and the need for cooperation are themselves potential future problems, as regards internal migration for example.
We must also agree that we will not try to solve the problems unilaterally, but that we will seek to cooperate, with all the countries that belong to the Schengen area working together to solve the problems that arise in the future.
As I said, we must ensure that what is currently happening in Italy does not happen, i.e. that one country tries to solve on its own what is in fact a shared problem.
<D>
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, this has been a difficult report.
There has unfortunately been very little time to reach compromises or for real debate on some of the issues - hence the large number of amendments.
However, I am pleased with many elements of what we do have, such as the need to tackle the issue of elder abuse.
More needs to be done, urgently, to end the physical, financial, emotional and other forms of abuse regularly suffered by older people.
The latest estimate puts the number of older people that have suffered abuse at over 10%, which is a staggering figure.
That is why I welcome the Commission's intention to bring forward a communication on that issue.
But we must do more.
Member States must also work towards ensuring independence, free personal care, lifelong learning and freedom from discrimination at the workplace for all older people.
That means, of course, fully implementing the 2000 Employment Directive and then building on it.
We must work to put an end to employees being thrown onto the employment scrapheap, whether at 50, 55 or 65.
An arbitrary age of statutory retirement must be abolished, whilst ensuring a statutory pension age, set at Member State level.
There is a very clear difference between the two.
Individuals then have a choice to stop work and take their pensions, or to continue working and either take their pension or defer it until they choose to stop working.
Unfortunately, I was unable to achieve consensus on this, and therefore it is not in the report, but I believe Member States must be encouraged to look at this for the future.
I have tabled a number of amendments on behalf of my group, which I hope other Members will see fit to support, but most of the issues covered by this report should remain within the competence of the Member States.
There is, of course, still a great deal we can do in terms of exchange of best practice.
<D>
(HU) Thank you, Mr President.
Mr Matsakis has already mentioned the problems of implementation, and I would simply like to give a couple of examples.
In Europe and the Carpathian basin the protection of our forests is presenting more and more of a challenge.
In some places forests are set alight, in others they are obliterated or they are quite simply stolen.
In the Carpathians or, for example, in Sajólád, 30-40% of the forests have already been stolen.
Illegal felling reduces biodiversity, causes erosion, and contributes 20% of greenhouse gas emissions.
To call a halt to this, four of our fellow MEPs sent a written statement to the Commission about a law to allow only timber and products from trees from legal and controlled felling to be sold in the EU.
I would ask my fellow MEPs to sign in support of the statement of the 23rd.
Preserving biodiversity is an important national objective.
The Hungarian Government's position on neglect of the Natura 2000 sites is such that this week, when we are celebrating the Day of the Land, the Central Europe Rally, part of the Dakar Series, was organised, unimpeded, through areas of enhanced environmental protection, and even through Natura 2000 sites.
There was no environmental impact assessment, no plans for rehabilitation or protection, and there was not even a licence for organising the competition.
There is no income that can compensate for the environmental damage this causes.
But we do not manage any better with our birds either.
It was only two weeks ago that the European Commission sent Hungary a final written warning.
It did this because Hungary had not brought in any national measures to protect wild birds.
But I do not want to give only bad examples.
Recently a unique, voluntary agreement in Europe was signed in Hungary too, thanks to my initiative, on halting the loss of birdlife caused by overhead electricity cables.
Under this project for an obstacle-free sky, the general public, the electricity industry and the state agreed that, by arranging cables, insulation and so on, there would be a safe 'sky corridor' in Hungary for birds by 2020.
This is a ground-breaking agreement, of major significance, and deserves Europe's attention and support.
Thank you.
<D>
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, members of the Commission, the debate about the work programme is, as always, the moment of truth.
It is here that we see what the statements made in public on so many different occasions are really worth.
If we look at the programme in more detail, it becomes apparent, unfortunately, that these announcements are not being acted on, notably as regards the financial perspective or the Commission's forward planning.
We have before us a climate protection programme which suggests that the Bali conference never happened, as if Europe had never positioned itself as a key pioneer to avert the dangers of climate change at global level.
The car industry has applied the brakes, and the Commission is sitting back and watching.
The Member States are being given their heads and allowed to undercut each other in introducing ever-lower environmental standards for their own industries and making ever-greater concessions to their own car manufacturers.
Unfortunately, we see the same thing happening across the board in the industrial sector.
As ever, the focus is on nuclear energy: an industry which squanders capacity, finances and energy.
Even though Europe has an innovative renewables sector, the European level has nothing but small change to spare for this sector after it has given its commitment and allocated its financial resources and planning elsewhere.
That is completely unacceptable.
If we are to remain market leaders here, we must send out a clear and unequivocal message, and that means setting the priority where it is needed.
We have the same problem, unfortunately, when it comes to employment relations.
I would underline just one issue here: the Working Time Directive which has now been agreed, and where considerable concessions have clearly been made.
It is a slap in the face for all our young people who want to build a future for themselves.
This is not how we should be treating our workers.
Finally, we have the debate about the financial markets.
I can only endorse what the previous speaker, Mr Swoboda, said.
The last remaining champions of self-regulation of the financial markets are here in this House.
Even in the US, regulations are being considered, but on this side of the Atlantic we seem to be pretending that this will all happen of its own accord.
We should be signalling our willingness to create a sound framework so that the financial markets can no longer evolve in the same direction as before, where nonsensical financial products took precedence over sound economic policy.
From my perspective, this whole programme is a huge disappointment.
<D>
(ES) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in the 2003 'black spring' raids in Cuba, 75 dissidents were imprisoned, accused of being spies for the United States.
Orlando Zapata was arrested at the same time for disrespect, public disorder and disobedience.
The wives of the 75 dissidents formed the 'Ladies in White' group, which was awarded the Sakharov Prize for freedom of thought by Parliament in 2005.
Incidentally, I would like to point out that the Castro regime did not grant visas to the 'Ladies in White' to come here to Parliament to collect their prize.
The Cuban Human Rights Commission recognises that there are around 200 political prisoners there, 22 of whom are journalists.
Cuba is third in the sad world ranking of imprisoned journalists, behind Iran with 52 and China with 24.
Orlando Zapata, aged 42, was declared a prisoner of conscience by Amnesty International.
He began a hunger strike on 3 December 2009 due to the repeated beatings that he received and other ill treatment, and died on 23 February, 85 days after he began his hunger strike.
Parliament should express its support for the family and friends of Mr Zapata and express its great concern at the state of human rights in Cuba.
This House should send a clear message to the Castro regime, especially in the context of the Spanish Presidency.
The Spanish Presidency should, incidentally, be much more active in defending fundamental rights in Cuba.
Finally, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take this opportunity to call for the immediate release of all political prisoners in Cuba.
<D>
(EL) Mr President, some decades ago millions of our fellow European citizens emigrated to America, Australia, South Africa and other European countries.
They were not rich, but were escaping from poverty.
We asked for them to be accepted and to be given rights.
The money they sent home supported our economies.
Thousands of Italian, Greek and Irish flags fly in those countries on the days of our national festivals.
They love the countries to which they went, but they are also allowed to love their countries of origin; nobody feels threatened by this dual love.
They excelled and boosted the economies and cultural and democratic wealth of the host countries.
As a result, immigration should surely not be treated primarily as a police phenomenon, let alone as a likely source of terrorism, as it has ended up being discussed in Europe.
Immigration policy ought to be comprehensive and should cover a whole range of aspects:
firstly, improvement of legal migration channels;
secondly, combating clandestine immigration, especially inhumane immigrant trafficking rings; and upholding respect for human rights at detention centres.
The only crime committed by these people is to have been born in poor or war-torn countries;
thirdly, the reason for the surge of immigrants: wars, poverty, underdevelopment, dictatorships; Europe must tackle these phenomena in its foreign and economic policy;
fourthly, we should ask why Europe is so attractive to immigrants.
At the same time, we must combat illegal employment;
fifthly, the demographic, research, educational and economic needs of the European Union; we must attract a much-needed labour force;
sixthly, respect for fundamental rights;
seventhly, creating a European bridge between peoples and cultures, thus strengthening our foreign policy.
Very few of the above require police action.
On the other hand, they require politicians with insight and boldness.
I am glad that, after its initial emphasis on a police-based approach, the Commission is now moving forward with a much better overall approach.
I congratulate Mr Frattini!

With regard to the European Union's so-called 5 billion package for the European economic recovery plan, it is useful to recall the resolution adopted by this Parliament on the mid-term review of the 2007-2013 financial framework.
That resolution states: that the own-resources ceiling represents 1.24% of EU GNI in payments and that this has effectively been below 1%; that every year significant margins are left below the ceiling set up by the multiannual financial framework, with over EUR 29 billion in payments in the last three years; and that huge margins exist between the multiannual financial framework ceiling and the ceiling of the EU own resources, with over EUR 176 billion from 2010 to 2013.
In view of this, we must ask ourselves: why is it that, faced with the worsening economic situation, we are not at least using the funds provided in the multiannual financial framework?
Why is the European Union opting to deduct EUR 2 billion from the agriculture margin, when thousands of farmers are facing ever greater difficulties?
Do farmers have a greater need for support to deal with increasing costs of production and falling prices to the producer, or for broadband Internet?
To ensure that this adjustment is neutral, from which other budget headings will almost EUR 2 billion be deducted?
Will this amount be deducted from cohesion?
How will they go about distributing the nearly EUR 4 billion for projects in the area of energy and the nearly EUR 1 billion for - apparently - the promotion of broadband in rural areas?
How will this unfair exchange be applied?
Where, finally, is the highly proclaimed solidarity across the European Union?
Or will the mountain, in the end, once again turn out to be a molehill?
<D>
(SK) I want to thank the rapporteur, Mr Schnellhardt, for his report, dealing with two different themes that are subject to different procedures.
Since the hygiene of foodstuffs is subject to the codecision procedure, this procedure will inevitably hold back the area of prices and transport conditions, subject only to a consultation process.
I agree with the stipulation that food safety requirements in individual Member States must be the same across the board, or at least should not significantly differ from each other.
However, here we come to the question of imports to the European Union from third countries where the foodstuffs are full of pesticides.
We have a polluted environment, which has a negative impact on human health.
Consequently, we must do everything possible to prevent unhealthy foodstuffs from damaging our health.
We have to start testing foodstuffs, their components and the raw materials of animal and plant origin for health hazards, hygienic acceptability and biological values.
We have to concentrate on identification or on possible falsification.
We have to test for foreign materials in food and to focus on everyday use: for example not just phthalates in toys, which are not used by everyone on a daily basis.
Slovak producers are often criticised with regard to the hygiene of foodstuffs.
I must point out, however, that Slovakia has much stricter food standards than the 15 old Member States.
<D>
Madam President, to the President-in-Office, but now in absentia, I would say: you spoke eloquently this morning about the challenge to our economic future, which is rightly at the top of our agenda, but no less rightly and no less eloquently you made it clear at the summit, and again today, that your intention is to maintain the timetable and the targets for tackling climate change.
Your words are fundamental and right.
The climate change package, you said, is so important that we cannot simply lose it under the pretext of a financial crisis.
It was very significant that Chancellor Merkel, despite the real concerns her country and others have, made it clear that Germany spoke out in favour of implementing the climate change targets and finding solutions before the December summit.
If that is the challenge you give us, I believe Parliament will respond, effectively and in good time.
But the focus now, I have to say, is with the Council.
To achieve this, we will need reassurances for the countries which have real problems, as Poland does with coal.
We will need to be clear about the criteria for the lighter touch which we know will be provided for a limited list of industries and sectors faced with real leakage challenges.
We must also be very clear that our support for biofuels in transport is dependent on the development of fuels from sustainable sources.
Without that, we could do irreparable damage to our environment and to the habitats of people, wildlife and plant life.
We have set ourselves an enormous challenge, but it is one that we cannot afford to lose.
An environmental disaster would make our current economic problems pale into insignificance.
As President Sarkozy said, the two policies must ride together.
But we must just make sure - and the President must make sure - that Parliament is not left stranded by the Council's inability to follow his lead.
<D>
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FR) Commissioner, first of all, I would like to note for the record that my colleagues from the Conference of Presidents, who decided on a late-night debate against my wishes, are all absent this evening.
Were it not for this being a late-night debate, I would be pleased to have finally initiated a discussion of this serious matter, which is the recognition by the Court of Justice of wage dumping, a matter that you just spent 20 seconds on, Commissioner, in a remarkably offhand manner.
Therefore, I will briefly outline the three stages of this new dimension of European law.
11 December 2007: the Court quashed a trade union action claiming that the Finnish shipping company Viking Line should not be allowed to register its ferry in Estonia to reduce workers' wages.
18 December 2007: the Court again found against the unions, this time in Vaxholm, Sweden, for blockading a building against a Latvian company which was refusing to observe the collective agreement applicable to the building sector.
3 April 2008: the Court found Lower Saxony in Germany guilty of imposing a minimum salary on any construction company awarded a procurement contract.
The Court then found in favour of a Polish subcontractor of a German company, which was paying its workers less than half the prescribed minimum wage.
This was the Rüffert ruling.
In all three cases, the fundamental reason invoked by the Court to justify its decision to encourage wage dumping was that Community law prohibits any measure - take note - likely to 'make less attractive' the conditions of a company from another Member State because this is - and I quote - a 'restriction on the freedom to provide services' or the freedom of establishment, which are among the fundamental freedoms guaranteed by the Treaty.
This is quite simply unacceptable.
Where is the social aspect of this liberal reasoning?
Effectively, any social progress in a country will make a market less attractive - to use the Court's expression - for competing companies.
I should add that, in all three cases, the famous Posting of Workers Directive has not offered the slightest protection to the workers concerned.
Incidentally, the Court explained that, and I quote, the 'directive seeks in particular to bring about the freedom to provide services'.
It did not mention the protection of workers.
Finally, in all three cases, the Court reached its decision in the light of specific articles of the Treaty and not just the directive.
These were Article 43, in the first case, and Article 49, in the two others, both being reproduced word for word in the draft Treaty of Lisbon currently in the process of ratification.
My conclusion is therefore clear.
Amending a directive to solve the problem posed by these rulings is not sufficient.
Anyone who wants to re-establish the primacy of social rights over free trade must insist on a revision of the treaties, and specifically the articles relied on by the Court to justify its recent decisions.
This is difficult, but I think that it is necessary, because otherwise we can expect a real crisis over the legitimacy of the current European economic and social model.
<D>
(SK) Responsibility for the health systems in the Union rests first and foremost with Member States.
Responsibility for the organisation and provision of healthcare and medical services in accordance with Article 152 of the Treaty is fully recognised.
The proposal aims to introduce and ensure a transparent framework for the provision of safe, high-quality and effective cross-border healthcare within the Union, at the same time ensuring a high level of health protection while fully respecting the principle of subsidiarity.
Although I wholeheartedly approve of the intention and goals set in the directive, I should like to point out certain shortcomings of the proposal that could be overcome.
Some are afraid that this type of care might place the health insurance systems in some Member States under undue pressure.
We need a more precise definition of procedures relating to providing care and reimbursement in respect of repeated hospitalisations and damages, as well as treating complications.
We must set a time horizon for reimbursement of costs and at the same time clearly state that the directive neither will not wants to solve the long-term healthcare issues in such establishments where the health and social systems usually meet.
The term 'beneficial for the patient' must be specified.
The medical aspects should be taken into consideration in the first place, not subjective benefits.
When specifying the terms 'hospital care' and 'outpatient care', it would also be good to specify the term 'specialised outpatient healthcare'.
In addition to that, the problem of the method of reimbursement of prescriptions issued in other countries still remains.
Ladies and gentlemen, just like on those other occasions when we witnessed the introduction of free movement in the past, certain worries exist.
In my opinion, however, they are not insurmountable.
<D>
- (FR) Madam President, I should like to begin by commending the work of our colleague, Mr Andersson.
What exactly does the European Union want, though?
A single market abandoned to unbridled competition that quashes collective rights as a whole, or a regulated single market that enables the citizens to carry out decent work throughout Europe?
The messages from the European Court of Justice, often those from the Commission, and at times those from the Council Presidency, are neither clear nor always consistent.
A society is only worth, and only survives by, the contract with which it provides itself.
Deregulation, the 'every man for himself' approach, leads to even more deregulation and, ultimately, to the explosion of the system.
This is not what we want.
Yes, indeed, we want an internal market, but a market that serves to improve the living and working conditions of our fellow citizens.
The Treaty of Lisbon sets out a number of principles, including the right to negotiate collective agreements.
Let us ensure that this principle is respected by the European Union and by all the Member States.
<D>
We believe that media literacy is a matter for the Member States.
The draft statement that we have before us in the European Parliament certainly contains some good advice (and some not so good advice for that matter), but this is a matter for the Member States alone.
The proposals in the report also enter the area of the curricula in Member States' education systems.
The June List has previously pointed out in this Parliament - and now does so again - that the Member States alone are responsible for the organisation of teaching and the content of education systems.
In grand speeches much is said about subsidiarity, but the reality is rather different.
The EU should involve itself in cross-border issues but keep out of matters that individual Member States can decide on themselves or that are already regulated in other international treaties.
For this reason, we have voted against the motion for a resolution.
<D>
- (SK) In connection with the financial crisis in recent weeks the inhabitants of Europe have seen how the Member States in the Euro Zone are better equipped to cope with large disruptions.
People also see this in my own country, Slovakia, which joins the Euro Zone on 1 January.
The financial investors and speculators from the currency markets already consider us to be part of the Euro Zone.
It no longer pays to speculate with our currency, since we have established a fixed conversion rate.
At the same time, the currencies of our neighbouring countries are falling.
Speculators see in them a level of risk which they do not wish to incur, due to the crisis on the financial markets.
Some currencies have fallen to their lowest levels in years.
The adoption of the euro for a small and open economy shields entrepreneurs and inhabitants from fluctuations in the exchange rate.
Even the inhabitants of the country with the highest level of employment in the world, Denmark, which has long had one of the highest levels of competitiveness and highest standard of living in the world, have discovered that if they were members of the Euro Zone they would have more favourable rates of exchange and they would be better able to tackle the current global problems.
The same also applies to Sweden, of course, which we have been discussing here today.
Perhaps now is the right moment for them to reassess their entry into the Euro Zone.
The criticism has been raised today by a colleague from my own country that the Slovak government is drawing up measures for strengthening the framework of regulation and supervision.
I would like to draw his attention to a resolution of the European Parliament, which recently asked the Commission to propose measures for strengthening the framework of regulation and supervision across the entire EU.
There is no other way.
That is why a majority of MEPs from various political groups voted in favour of this option.
I would like to end by congratulating both rapporteurs for an excellent report.
<D>
(PT) Madam President, Commissioner, at a time when the air transport sector is going through one of its most difficult crises due to the unparalleled rise in fuel prices, it is vital that we invest our attention and our legislative effort in measures that will help to maintain the strength and dynamism of this sector.
In this context, the commitment to improve the common rules for the operation of air services in the Community must cover some fundamental points: firstly, reinforcement of the financial fitness requirements for airlines, given the potential relationship between the financial soundness of carriers and safety; secondly, transparency in the setting of ticket prices with a clear indication, in addition to the basic cost, of the taxes, duties and other charges, and, finally, the unequivocal definition of public service obligations, including conditions resulting from specific constraints in the outermost regions and the need to safeguard competition.
The rapporteur proposes that we accept the Council common position.
This means that, in addition to the points already mentioned, the main objectives identified by Parliament at first reading have been achieved.
In effect, this text formulates and defines proper rules on the issues of operating licences, leasing of aircraft, public service obligations and traffic distribution rules, while reinforcing the internal market and passenger rights.
It therefore gives the Commission the right to negotiate intra-Community traffic rights with third countries and reinforces the employment rights of those working in the sector.
I must therefore congratulate Mr Degutis on his work in this respect and support the acceptance of the Council common position without further amendment.
Both arms of the legislative authority have worked to achieve an important agreement.
Will the result help to overcome the crisis?
I was pleased to hear the Commissioner's response.
Will this help to ensure a better and more effective internal market in aviation that will be of benefit to the economy and people?
We hope so.
<D>
(ES) Madam President, on 18 October, a trial will begin in the Turkish city of Diyarbakir of 28 leaders of the Democratic Turkey Party (DTP).
They include 14 representatives elected by the public: 12 mayors and two municipal councillors.
Their crime is peacefully defending their political positions, which could cost them between 15 years and life in prison.
The banning of the DTP and the arrests that I have mentioned are one more example of the persecution being suffered by the Kurdish minority in Turkey.
These events were expressly condemned in the resolution that we adopted on 10 February analysing the progress made by Turkey in 2009 in moving closer to the Union, but we do not think that sufficient progress has been made.
If we are consistent and we wish to help the victims and help Turkey to move forward in the right way, we can do so.
During this period, let us support the movement of solidarity with the Kurdish cause.
I would therefore like to urge the Commission and Parliament to send an official representative to the trial in Diyarbakir.
<D>
(BG) I would like to draw your attention to important cyber security-related issues.
Preventing the risks associated with the Internet's rapid expansion is much more effective than repairing the damage caused by its abusive use.
A number of actions at least are required to do this.
Firstly, cyberspace requires protection which is dynamic and does not build static walls, but relies on flexibility and proactive innovation.
Secondly, the legislation governing the Internet must utilise and not restrict the opportunities offered by information technologies.
Thirdly, very active horizontal coordination is required of the various institutions involved with cyber security.
Fourthly, cyber security requires highly active and efficient mechanisms for international cooperation and coordination.
I would like to encourage the European Commission to demonstrate particular determination and resolve and to insist in future legislative initiatives on devising and implementing a European cyber security strategy and creating positions or a mechanism to facilitate the horizontal coordination of all communities and national policies relating to this issue.
<D>
Co-Chairman of the EFD Group. - Mr Barroso, it is very good to see you here.
A chance to hold the executive to account surely must be welcomed.
As you know, I have not always been one of your biggest supporters, but I have to concede you have done very well.
You have managed to ignore the French referendum result, you have managed to ignore the Dutch referendum result and you have managed to bully the Irish into submission the second time around.
So you have almost got your Treaty.
Now, of course, it is time to pick the President - the big global figurehead of the European Union.
Tony Blair is the odds-on favourite with the bookmakers.
I just wondered whether you agree with me that his continued support for Britain to join the euro, his surrender of GBP 2 billion a year of the British rebate and his whole approach towards Britain's membership of the European Union - his refusal to give the British a referendum - all show that he has sufficient pro-European credentials to become the President?
Indeed, was this the deal that I predicted back in 2005?
Was this agreed all along?
<D>
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a great deal has been said here on the substance of the Treaty.
We German Liberals have always attached vital importance to certain key points.
Firstly, the institutional compromise had to be preserved.
Secondly, we wanted an EU foreign minister, not as an embellishment but as a genuine mouthpiece of the European Union.
We agree entirely with what Jacek Saryusz-Wolski said a few moments ago about institutional improvements.
We still believe, however, that the Common Foreign and Security Policy will continue for the foreseeable future to stand or fall by the political will of the Member States, and that is regrettable.
The third point to which we attached particular importance was firm protection of fundamental rights, and for this reason we look forward eagerly to the proclamation of the Charter.
On the whole, it must be said that the Treaty of Lisbon is a success for German-Portuguese cooperation, for which both Presidencies deserve to be congratulated.
A real fly in the ointment, however, is the lack of progress in bringing decision-making processes closer to the people.
The Council's decision not to present a consolidated text is what we would call Realsatire in German, meaning a real-life situation which is more absurd than anything a satirist could dream up.
This decision will soon be overtaken by events, however.
I am sure that the public and the parliaments will obtain copies of the consolidated text for themselves and read up on what the Treaty is really all about.
We must now enter a phase in which the European Union reverts from institutional navel-gazing to the adoption of a global outlook.
We must discharge our international economic responsibility.
The general state of the world economy raises the spectre of slower growth and job losses in Europe.
In many Member States, including my own, I am aware of a reversion to complacency and a weakening of the will to enact reforms.
That has to change.
My second point is that we must play our role in international politics responsibly.
People want the European Union to have a strong global role.
The responsibility is ours.
<D>
Vice-President of the Commission. - I could, of course, speak for at least one hour on these issues.
Our doings in this area are reflected in the ongoing discharge process and in many communications from the Commission, in many discharge resolutions and in many speeches in the Budgetary Control Committee.
So, firstly, I can assure you that we are dealing very seriously with these issues and the situation is improving.
The system is as follows.
The budgetary authority, which means Parliament, authorises the Commission to use money and which money can be used to implement Community policies.
There is a special spending programme, which has its own legal basis.
Parliament also designs this legal basis, so the rules are decided by the budgetary authority relating to the budget.
Next comes implementation, where there are different layers.
One of these is, of course, the Commission, which is the main actor responsible for implementing the budget.
Our activities in improving financial governance are reflected in our annual activity reports, and the Court of Auditors has evaluated that they are getting better and better and more adequately reflect the situation.
This is one internal part.
Another is the control and auditing systems, which have also been strengthened in recent years, for instance in internal policies in the research family, where we have increased the control and auditing staff.
What is also important in this particular part is that there is shared management.
Much also depends on the contribution of, and efforts made by, Member States to cut back their errors and to avoid the misuse of money.
There is also improvement in this area.
A completely new instrument has been introduced - the so-called annual summary of all reports of paying agencies.
These were carefully analysed for the first time last year and this is now being done again.
So the situation is improving.
The Court of Auditors' report, which also has been greatly changed from the beginning of our period, now quantifies the changes.
This quantification of changes also shows that there has been an improvement.
So European money is quite rigidly managed - even too rigidly in some areas.
We can show what has been done.
But we can also clearly say that this is far from perfect.
This is a huge machine which must work smoothly.
According to the Court of Auditors' estimations, in most areas, 98% of all transactions are carried out without errors.
In the Structural Funds, this is almost 90%, so the vast majority of transactions will not include errors, and any errors will be corrected.
The number of correction decisions relating to the Structural Funds has increased tremendously during this period.
I can, of course, provide you with a lot of numbers if needed.
These are some indications, but of course it is clear that this does not cover the whole of the answer to the simple question: 'How do you manage the European budget?'
<D>
(ES) Mr President, the European Council met this morning to decide its position on three challenges, as explained to us by Mr Kouchner.
These are: firstly, the disproportionate reaction, violation of international law, and invasion and ongoing occupation of a sovereign State; secondly, the disregard for a peace plan signed thanks to the diligence of the Presidency of the European Union, and, thirdly, recognition of the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia which, by curiously invoking the precedent of Kosovo, has been rapidly recognised by Venezuela, Belarus and Hamas: 'A man is known by the company he keeps'.
Today's response from the European Council to these challenges is very clear: we are at a crossroads in our relations with Russia.
We have to be serious, Mr President, because we cannot continue in this way.
The prestige and credibility of the European Union are at stake.
The EU cannot simply sign the cheque for these great modern dramas.
Despite the excellent work of Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, we, as the European Union, are not just here to pay for the damage and destruction wrought by the Russians in Georgia or by the Israelis in Palestine.
We must have a proper foreign policy.
I would ask you, Mr Jouyet, to ensure that, on the 8th when the President of the Council of the European Union, Mr Sarkozy, visits Moscow, purely in the interests of ensuring consistency in the principles that we apply and value in the European Union, he gives a clear warning and a blunt and credible message that flouting international rules and law and violating the territorial integrity of a sovereign State will have a cost in terms of relations with the European Union.
This is important as there must be consequences, Mr President, and, in this respect, there is a lot riding on this.
<D>
rapporteur. - Madam President, the positive result of the Irish referendum on the Lisbon Treaty brings us one step closer to that moment in time when the European Parliament will not only be consulted by the Council, but will have codecision powers on matters which are now under the third pillar.
The question then is: why is the Council so keen to adopt legislation a few months before that date when, moreover, that legislation does not represent a step forward in establishing a genuine European area of freedom, security and justice?
The truth is that this proposal does not help prevent any conflicts of jurisdiction, and does not provide for any settlement when such situations arise.
This could be done, for example, by reducing multiple jurisdiction and by allocating jurisdiction to Member States, as was done through various regulations on civil law, with the obligation to mutually recognise the decisions that followed from that allocation of jurisdiction.
Instead, this Framework Decision is limited to a duty of Member States to inform one another and to enter into direct consultation in order to reach 'consensus on any effective solution aimed at avoiding the adverse consequences arriving from parallel proceedings'.
That is why I was not surprised when, during the exchange of views in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs a few weeks ago, the Commission - although supporting the current proposal - mentioned it would come up with a new proposal at a later stage.
That is also why I am not surprised by what the Commissioner has said this evening.
I thank the Commission for being so honest about the proposal, but have to say that I consider this proposal and the entire procedure for its adoption a good example of how we should not legislate within the European Union.
I strongly believe that what is important is to protect our citizens' rights and not just to tick boxes.
By the way, the Council is not present today, although the Presidency was one of the initiators of the proposal.
I have to stress that within the European Parliament, we took our work very seriously.
We worked in good faith during the last mandate and this one, and would hope to be sending a message on our views on having more effective legislation.
What I welcome about this proposal is that the current text explicitly refers to the principle of ne bis in idem.
This was due to the exchange of views we had with the Council and the Commission, as the original text proposed did not mention it at all.
The report I drafted pays particular attention to three aspects.
Firstly, I believe that the protection of persons formally charged must receive the highest attention and consistent procedural safeguards have to be provided for.
These should include the right of the formally charged person to receive enough information for him or her to have a basis upon which to challenge any solution which does not appear to be reasonable.
Secondly, with regard to the details concerning the person formally charged, which national authorities exchange through the notifications, I support the idea that it is important to ensure an adequate level of data protection and that it should be specified in this Framework Decision what kind of personal data is exchanged.
Last but not least, I strongly believe that the involvement of Eurojust in the decision on the choice of jurisdiction is of the utmost importance.
In my opinion, Eurojust should be involved from the earliest stage because of its coordinating role and because of its more and more relevant tasks.
I am among those who consider that we created this Agency not only to show that we are concerned with combating transborder crime, but because we need strong instruments.
Eurojust has already proved in the years since its establishment that it deserves our trust.
That is why I am surprised by the reluctance shown by the Council and by some colleagues in the European Parliament.
Having said that, I would like to call on the European Commission to present at the earliest opportunity a proposal completing this Framework Decision on the conflicts of jurisdiction.
I will finish by thanking the shadow rapporteurs for the way they worked on this report.
<D>
on behalf of the ALDE group. - (NL) I should like to quote from the White Paper: 'Nowadays, lorries are no longer forced to return empty from international deliveries.
They can even pick up and deliver loads within a Member State other than their country of origin.
Road cabotage has become a reality.'
This is what the European Commission said in 2001.
Since that time, a number of Member States have once again introduced a number of restrictions and so, once again, we have a fragmented market that we did not have in 2001.
What does the Commission say now?
We shall mould this fragmentation into rules so that the fragmentation is the same for all.
I am therefore very disappointed - I even said so to Commissioner Barrot - with the Commission proposal, which means a step back in comparison to the 1993 directive.
Fortunately we have been able to do something about this but, in my view, nowhere near enough.
What is it that we are doing, then?
We are spending billions of euro via Galileo in order to ensure that we know where the transport is.
This means that a transport company can organise its operation efficiently throughout the European market and then we say: no, stop, bureaucracy.
You must submit papers despite being busy.
You must do all kinds of things that mean you operate less efficiently and even possibly see your lorries returning empty.
That is what the Commission is now saying, and I find it a major disappointment that the Commission even dare put it down on paper.
Therefore, in this instance, I believe that the social aspect is a kind of excuse that is very readily used.
Otherwise, why would the French authorities approach Belgian transport companies to find out whether they are conducting no cabotage or too much cabotage in France?
The wages in Belgium are higher than in France, not lower.
This is not a social issue; it is about protecting a country's own market.
The result, therefore, will be greater environmental damage followed by, within a couple of weeks, Commission proposals for green transport.
Congratulations!
Fortunately, therefore, we and the rapporteur have been able to do a number of things about this.
I hope that these make it through.
We have the prospect of an open market by 2014, but this is not enough as far as I am concerned.
I would prefer to see this achieved by 2012.
Nor do I believe that we require new studies.
This time, we must truly throw open the market - and, Mr Piecyk, I agree with your amendment - in order to ensure that action is taken in the event of a disruption in the market.
This action must be taken in an open market, however, not by creating additional obstacles in a market in which there are already hundreds.
With regard to the report by Mrs Ţicău, I am in full agreement with a strict approach towards people who are starting out in the business.
Incidentally, I have made the requirements even more stringent on a number of points.
I thank the rapporteur for entering into discussion with me in this respect.
If we are strict towards the players in the market, therefore, we must also ensure that the market is truly an open one.
<D>
Mr President, I voted against his report.
While there may well be good points in it, it eventually went too far.
I am in favour of streamlining European Union regulations, but not if you make it more bureaucratic, difficult to operate and unfavourable to industry.
The attempt to bring agriculture into this legislation is, to me, totally unacceptable and is a step too far.
It must be rejected.
To bring in soil protection is not the responsibility of the European Parliament, nor can it be done throughout the whole of the European Union.
That should be the responsibility of the national governments.
I have to ask why the Committee on Agriculture was not consulted on this particular issue.
You cannot bring in regulations that are destructive and make pig and poultry farmers go out of business.
The truth is that we are bringing in regulations in Europe, and restricting production in Europe, whilst allowing imports into the European Union that are not produced to the same standards as they are in Europe.
I cannot accept that.
<D>
President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) To reply to Mr Crowley, Europe has suffered an increasing number of disasters and major crises over recent years.
The forest fires and floods which hit several European countries recently have demonstrated that it is vital that we improve the efficiency and capacity of the European Union's response to emergences.
This too needs to be done in a spirit of solidarity and protection for our citizens.
We need solidarity and unity and we need to protect citizens inside and outside the European Union.
That is why the Presidency's priorities included strengthening the European Union's response capacity to disasters and crises.
Starting from existing Community resources, especially the Community's civil protection mechanism, we need to proceed through various stages of response to disasters.
Firstly, we need prevention, research and information.
We need to step up work to implement early warning systems.
Secondly, we need to prepare for crises, which means strengthening management and response capacities and coordination between the agencies involved at Community and international level.
Through intervention we hope to increase the capacity to provide European humanitarian aid and civil protection and thus improve the Community civil protection mechanism around a more operational centre.
There are therefore different competent working parties studying these topics within the framework of the Council and the Council will consider this work before the end of the year.
For the honourable Members' information, the Presidency will be organising a civil protection exercise on 4 and 6 November involving all the directors-general of civil protection in the Member States.
This will allow us to see on the ground what progress is needed in this very important sector.
<D>
(RO) The European Common Asylum System is currently fraught with a lack of consistency with the legal instruments for international protection.
As a result of the major discrepancies in the decision-making processes which the 27 Member States use for dealing with asylum applications, the rate in terms of acknowledging applicants' refugee status varies between 0% and approximately 90%.
In addition, the Dublin system's criteria place a disproportionate burden on Member States located at the European Union's external border as they are responsible for processing asylum applications as the first country of entry.
Phenomena such as secondary movements from one Member State to another and multiple applications still exist.
One of the most urgent requirements in EU asylum policy is the exchange of analyses, experiences and information between Member States.
Practicable solutions must also be found for developing cooperation between the administrative authorities responsible for examining asylum applications.
However, the most difficult problem to resolve remains communication between Member States about the different treatment given to applicants for international protection according to their country of origin.
I hope that the regulation for creating a European Asylum Support Office, proposed by the Commission three weeks ago, will help partially resolve the current issues.
I already urge future managers of this European office not to ignore cooperation with the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders, with the European migration network and with the competent bodies in Member States and third countries involved in migration and asylum activities.
Apart from avoiding duplication of effort, this cooperation will facilitate the coordination of actions by Member States and the use of their expertise on asylum matters.

in writing. - (DE) EU-wide liberalisation of postal services will happen - not in 2009, as originally planned, but in 2011.
In economic terms, the postal sector is very important, and it also impacts on other sectors of the economy.
As in all other areas of economic activity, more competition in the realm of postal deliveries makes sense.
Nor will businesses be the only beneficiaries, for consumers will reap great benefits too.
This will not be the case, however, unless the basic conditions are right.
In other words, it must be guaranteed that letters will be delivered as efficiently as ever and at reasonable prices.
Care must be taken to ensure that the blanket provision of postal services is guaranteed in the long term - and guaranteed everywhere, including remote areas.
Particular importance attaches to good working conditions and, above all, job security for all those who work in the postal services.
It is also important that the same conditions should govern the operations of all postal-service providers.
It was firmly established from the outset that this was not to be a cut-throat liberalisation.
We must create a good and sustainable arrangement for everyone - the postal companies, their employees and, of course, their customers.
<D>
in writing. - (NL) I fully support this report.
Every year an enormous quantity of dangerous goods, such as chlorine and petrol, is transported by inland waterway in the European Union.
No rules have so far been drawn up on that, although there is legislation on the transport of dangerous goods by road and rail.
Legislation on the transport of dangerous goods by boat is badly needed, not just for safety reasons but also to regulate protection of the environment and public health at European level.
Much of the transport of this kind is cross-border.
Furthermore, European rules are also to the benefit of businesses, which at the moment have to comply with different national requirements in the various Member States.
Inland waterways transport also emits less greenhouse gas.
It is therefore very important to harmonise the requirements for the various forms of transport.
It will then become more attractive to combine several modes, for instance with part of the journey being done by rail and the freight then continuing by boat.
Not only is that efficient, it is above all sustainable.
I therefore hope that transport firms will actually opt more often for a combination of different modes of transport.

The continued existence of economic and cultural inequalities on a global level has resulted in the development of new forms of slavery, no longer necessarily linked to the realm of sexual exploitation, but also to that of economic exploitation.
These situations may not match the historical view we have of slavery, but they are equally offensive.
They deprive their victims of the values of freedom and equality on which modern society is based.
Victims are priced, sold or bartered, and stripped of their dignity.
Trafficking in human beings is an extremely profitable business for organised crime, and it now has a cross-border dimension.
One year after the Treaty of Lisbon came into force, there have been many initiatives in the field of judicial and police cooperation in criminal matters.
We now need to strengthen the work of the EU by providing incentives for anti-trafficking actions, collecting data in order to compile reliable statistics, and establishing closer cross-border cooperation, including the exchange of information and best practice, as well as closer collaboration with Eurojust and Europol.
We also need to take a victim-focused approach.
Victims need protection, including legal protection.
They need assistance and social rehabilitation programmes.
Above all, however, it is important to increase the penalties for traffickers and employers who take advantage of the vulnerability of their victims, who are sometimes minors.

(EL) Mr President, Turkey is a candidate for accession to a united Europe.
It has rights and obligations.
The rapporteur has given a balanced interim report.
This offers Turkey another chance to proceed with the reforms and fulfil its obligations, which relate mainly to economic changes, respect for the Copenhagen criteria, and human, religious and minority rights.
We want Turkey to change because Turkey itself is asking for change and also because the times demand it.
Change in Turkey means meeting its obligations towards Cyprus by recognising the Republic of Cyprus and ending the occupation of Cyprus.
The report correctly states that the withdrawal of the Turkish army will help to reach a solution, and that the Turkish army can be replaced with a small European force under the command of the Security Council.
Turkey must fulfil the following obligations: end colonisation and change the demographic character of Cyprus; repatriate the settlers, who form the great majority in the occupied territories and are the time-bomb waiting to undermine any solution; end the appropriation of Greek Cypriot properties in occupied Cyprus; and stop the destruction of our cultural heritage.
As a first step, Turkey must respect the decisions of the UN and return the city of Famagusta to its lawful inhabitants.
Ankara regards Turkish Cypriots as isolated, owing to the presence of 45 000 Turkish soldiers, who are keeping Greek Cypriots away from their homes and properties.
Turkey holds the key both to its accession to Europe and to solving the Cyprus issue.
The Turkish policy of dividing Cyprus into two states is not a solution.
We live in an age of unification, not partition.
We say yes to a European Turkey and yes to a European solution, which have little in common with partition lines and zones; they should be based, as the rapporteur rightly stresses, on the principles of a united Europe.
This will create a viable model state for the whole of Europe, where Greek and Turkish Cypriots, and Christians and Muslims, can live peaceful and productive lives based on mutual respect for the principles and values of a united Europe.
<D>
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, every country created by breaking away from an existing country damages the territorial integrity of the original country and unilaterally alters the international legal order.
My country is one such example: it was created in 1830 by breaking away from the state created in 1815 by the Congress of Vienna.
Belgium's existence was recognised very quickly by the London Conference, which was attended by the United Kingdom, Prussia, Russia, Austria and France, but the Netherlands, from whom we had broken away, waited nine years before recognising Belgium.
I should actually have liked to tell the Serbian Minister for Foreign Affairs this if he had wanted to hear it.
This was not the case, however, as he repeated the familiar Serbian position ad nauseam without even a glimmer of an appreciation that opposing points of view also existed.
The only chink of light was his clear statement that Serbia would not use any form of violence, blackmail or intimidation whatsoever.
We must all now concern ourselves with the future - the future of Serbia, of Kosovo, of the whole region.
The European Union has already spent EUR 3 billion on Kosovo to date.
A further EUR 200 million is to be added to this for the coming 16 months, but that will not suffice.
With regard to Serbia and all the other Western Balkan countries, we must attend to visa facilitation as a matter of urgency, so that relations between the citizens of those countries and the citizens of our countries can be normalised.
<D>
(PL) Mr President, today Commissioner Hübner finds herself in a very difficult situation.
She has to reply on behalf of the Council, which has no representatives present.
During the Danish presidency in 2002, when there was a flash flood, they managed to mobilise themselves and prepare the relevant documents in a matter of weeks.
Today we should accuse the four presidencies for this sluggishness in reforming the Solidarity Fund.
We need this Fund.
The aid from it should not just be a token of our solidarity, but needs to be fast and effective, with a minimum of red tape.
I believe that we need to address two issues here.
One is how the Solidarity Fund should be managed, and in what situations, and the other is how to use other resources, from other funds, such as the Cohesion Fund, for long-term disaster prevention activities.
But this is a separate subject.
I would like to take this opportunity to ask the Commissioner a question.
At one time the question was discussed of setting up a 'rapid reaction instrument' and of readiness for major disasters, with a budget for this eventuality of approximately EUR 200 million.
I do not know what is happening with this project, which is also related to the issue under discussion.
<D>
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I will be very brief.
Firstly, on the report presented and debated here today and on the manner of this debate, I must thank you for your support.
In fact more than that, I must thank you for your recognition of the work carried out by the Council, the Commission and also the General Secretariat of the Council in preparing this report and its contents.
The comments we have heard have been music to our ears as they have recognised the detail, the merits and the effort put into this report.
We have also heard criticisms, specifically that we could here and there have improved the analysis and gone deeper into the causes and consequences.
This report is definitely heading that way: it is more analytical, or aims to be so, than previous reports and you should not be in any doubt, ladies and gentlemen, that we will continue along these lines as you have advised and suggested.
Comments were also made on the substance.
There was one Member who said that Europe has done something, or has done a great deal, but there is still a long way to go.
I believe that Europe is probably the greatest area of freedom, justice, human rights and rule of law.
It has followed a consistent and constant path in its ever stronger and more solid defence of human rights.
However, it is clear that there is always more that can be done because we will never reach the end in terms of freedom and human rights: there will always be something to defend, to develop, to protect and to safeguard.
However, we should recognise that, both internally and also externally, the European Union has done a great deal.
A recent case was cited: the decisions or measures that we have adopted in the area, for example, of the protection of children's rights.
We have done this.
I would also point out four or five initiatives in the area of human rights that indisputably prove what the EU is trying to do in terms of defending these human rights.
Here, tomorrow, we will solemnly proclaim the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
In this half of 2007, the European Union has secured the adoption, in the United Nations, of a resolution on a moratorium on the death penalty.
We have established the European Agency of Fundamental Rights which is in its final stages of preparation.
We have also created the European Day Against the Death Penalty.
These are concrete, specific and recent examples of how our work to defend human rights is continuous, persistent and solid.
We must accept that there will be problems and that there will be measures or actions or attitudes that may be less than perfect!
Yet we must also recognise the great successes that we have had in this area.
Specifically in terms of external action, reference was made to the EU-Africa Summit which will be debated next.
There can be no doubt that the issue of human rights and good governance was an important, in fact, a very important issue in the dialogue that we held in Lisbon during the EU-Africa Summit.
You all know, ladies and gentlemen, as do all European citizens, that, in our dialogue with third countries, the issue of the defence of human rights is a constant and priority theme on our agenda and in our bilateral dialogue.
This is proven by our condemnation whenever violations of human rights occur in third countries and by the measures that we have taken in response to violations of human rights in third countries, in particular by adopting sanctions which are specifically aimed at preventing these violations from reoccurring.
We should therefore recognise our merits and the efforts that we have made.
Of course we must also correct what can be corrected, but we should have, on this issue, a confident and positive attitude and a belief that we are on the right road in line with our humanist traditions.
<D>
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Madam President, a number of years ago two problems were identified with the European Schools.
One was that they were lagging far behind in inclusiveness and integrated policies for special education needs (SEN) children.
The other was that when parents would make an application to the school for a child with special needs, they had a practice of saying that they were not really able to meet their needs and the parents should go and find something else.
This really was not good enough.
In December 2007, Parliament set money aside in its budget to 'contribute to the financing of first-class education for SEN children and to promote the concept of inclusive education and that this sum is to be released upon presentation of a proposal for the launch of a pilot project for the SEN resource centre comprising qualified personnel with relevant experience and appropriate teaching materials'.
In the time I have I will not go through the negotiations, the back and forth, that have gone on about this pilot project.
What has come about is that the pilot project has become several half-posts in psychology and some other resources, but it is not what I would see as a pilot project: actual classes, integrated classes throughout the European Schools.
I feel it is time for us to be very clear about the goal.
The goal is inclusion and the goal is to integrate children in a way that is possible for them.
There are now 411 SEN pupils in the European Schools in the SEN project.
This is 2%, and yet disability in the general population is 17%.
We are still not allowing enough children with special education needs into the schools, so we are still missing out on 15%.
I cannot believe the figure for the population of people entitled to those schools is different from that in the general population.
We certainly need to have a project and assess the situation but we could do that for ever - we have been looking at the situation for ever!
It is time to move beyond the pilot schemes.
It is time to make a real approach to children as standard practice in all the schools.
We are a long way from doing that.
This is the other meaning of diversity.
It is not just about languages and cultures: it is about peoples' needs and their abilities and catering to the wide diversity of that as well.
<D>
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Mr President, if we fish out the sea off the coast of Mauritania, that causes the very poorest people to come to Europe as immigrants, because they can no longer see any future at home.
It is our poorest areas that have to deal with that, not the well-off areas.
Then Europe loses the support of its voters, especially those on very low incomes.
For that reason, too, cohesion policy is an absolute necessity.
It is sad in very many ways, but also entirely understandable, that Ireland has rejected the Lisbon Treaty.
The Lisbon Treaty is a real step forward for development policy.
It is the first text to establish coherence properly.
The Union should not take away from the poor countries with one hand what is given with the other.
The policy of the Union on agriculture, fisheries, trade should not run counter to development policy.
Certainly it relates to several policy areas, but this is not a question of rivalry between committees in this Parliament.
That is an unimportant detail.
The Treaty of Nice only required the Union to show itself a coherent force in the world.
That turned out not to be enough.
The agricultural policy shamelessly allowed our surpluses, such as sugar and grain, to be dumped on the world market with export subsidies.
Fortunately those are now more or less a thing of the past.
It is only in the Lisbon Treaty, though, that supporters of the poor countries can find a legal basis enabling them to safeguard solidarity with the poorest people in the world.
Ireland nevertheless voted against it.
It was mainly the people with the lowest incomes who said no, because the poorest in Europe do not identify enough with this European Union.
Too much insecurity, too many risks for them, they have to put up with the consequences of this incoherent and anti-social policy.
As the rapporteur, Mr Schmidt, has made crystal clear, the task is thus to show solidarity with all citizens of Europe and in the developing countries, whilst respecting the environment.
That is no small task.
There is a strong temptation to trade one of those solidarities against the other.
All the same, they are not opposed.
Solidarity with developing countries is necessary for genuine solidarity with people on low incomes in Europe and the rest of the world.
<D>
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - (HU) Thank you for the opportunity to speak, Mr President.
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, dissatisfaction among energy consumers has increased noticeably in recent years as a result of rising prices and a lack of regulatory transparency.
It is for precisely this reason that it is so important that the European Parliament will shortly be giving its blessing to a legislative package that will help to ensure that the electricity market functions more effectively.
I am convinced that the sharp rise in prices and the increasing helplessness of consumers has largely been due to the inadequate functioning of the market.
In many Member States, it is still the case that consumers compete for suppliers rather than the reverse.
In Hungary, for example, market liberalisation at present means higher prices and deteriorating standards of service, thanks to the hotchpotch manner in which market liberalisation is taking place as a result of mistakes by the government.
Adoption of the package of reports we are debating today could put an end to this situation.
The new legislation may at last enable genuine competition to take place in the energy market, and suppliers may finally find themselves in the position of actually having to compete for the consumers.
In addition, the energy package also creates better conditions for the kind of investment that is absolutely vital for the future of Europe's energy supply.
It will provide a stimulus for energy efficiency and, I believe, also facilitate the spread of renewable energies.
Another welcome feature of the proposals is that they reinforce consumer protection provisions, compliance with which is often lacking at present.
One of the reasons why this is particularly important now is because runaway energy prices are a major cause of poverty.
In my opinion, efforts in the field of energy policy should always be assessed in the light of consumer satisfaction.
We are taking an important step towards more effective regulation.
The package of proposals will boost competition while at the same time improving security of supply.
It is our hope that the adoption of this package will ensure that in future Europe's energy consumers will not face unreasonable prices as a result of regulatory inadequacies.
Thank you very much, Mr President.

This directive concerns the application of protection measures intended to assist victims of criminal acts whenever these endanger an individual's life, or physical, psychological or sexual wellbeing.
Protection measures exist in all EU Member States, but cease to take effect when someone crosses the country's borders.
The European Protection Order aims to ensure that the protection offered to an individual in one Member State will be maintained and continued in any other Member State to which the person relocates or has been relocated.
This is the position which the European Parliament adopted today, with 610 votes in favour, 13 against and 56 abstentions.
It is based on the compromise negotiated between Members of this House and representatives of the Belgian Presidency of the EU.
However, the text has yet to be confirmed by a qualified majority of Member States in the Council.
Although most of the protection measures are aimed at women who have been the victims of domestic violence, the new rules should apply to all victims: as the adopted report states, 'this directive applies to protection measures which aim at protecting all victims and not only the victims of gender violence, taking into account the specificities of each type of crime concerned'.
<D>
The proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on cross-border payments in the Community, which aims to replace the current applicable regulation, is linked to the creation of an integrated European payments market.
The proposal is also aimed at increasing the protection of consumers' interests and rights and easing the burden with regard to reporting statistics.
Article 5 on the balance of payments and Article 12 relating to the review clause are the subject of a compromise which our rapporteur, Margarita Starkevičiūtė, is aiming for and is supported by Bulgaria.
The compromise offers an opportunity for a timely, adequate assessment.
The current global financial crisis focuses attention on the need for relevant statistical data.
Bulgaria is in favour of removing settlement-based reporting obligations on payment service providers for balance of payments statistics under a threshold of EUR 50 000.
Bulgaria supports the removal of Article 5(2) as the reservations which have been expressed are made in the context of the potential loss of information and a deterioration in the quality of the balance of payments statistics, as well as to do with the need for a technical period for implementing the switch to the direct reporting system.
<D>
(DE) Madam President, the accomplishment of the internal market in postal services amply illustrates the truth of the saying 'Good things come to those who wait'.
Even I can support this draft on the table, the result of fifteen years of hard bargaining.
I happen to be one of those who would rather have preserved the monopoly of national postal administrations for letters below the 50-gramme threshold.
Now this last stage in the controlled deregulation of the postal market is set to take effect on 1 January 2011.
In view of the structure of the postal services in Luxembourg, the statutory requirement to employ volunteers from the armed forces in the public service and the resulting costs, I could not have subscribed to rapid and insufficiently controlled deregulation of the market in postal services, because that could have had intolerable consequences for postal staff and customers.
For the first reading, I therefore asked the rapporteur, Mr Ferber, to allow for a two-year extension of the transposition deadline for small countries with relatively few inhabitants so that they could continue to limit the provision of certain services to the universal-service provider, and I thank him for his understanding.
I had discreetly circumscribed this arrangement in order to ensure that Luxembourg benefited from the exemption, but the Ministers preferred to preclude any misunderstanding by naming the relevant countries.
This keeps us safe.
The important thing is that the universal-service requirement guarantees the collection of mail and its rapid delivery to the designated residential or business address on each working day, even in remote or sparsely populated areas.
The external funding that might be needed to cover the net cost of the universal service, and hence the question of affordable rates, has also been satisfactorily regulated.
Lastly, the best possible measures have been taken to safeguard permanent skilled jobs with universal-service providers and to guarantee adherence to terms of employment and social-security schemes based on existing legal provisions or collective agreements, contrary to what the Left would have us believe.
They ought to read the wording of the draft.
It also expressly stipulates that preparations for the deregulation of the postal market must take account of social considerations.
On the motion tabled by our philanthropic missionaries regarding free postal services for the visually impaired, I personally do not see why wealthy people with impaired vision should send their mail free of charge at the taxpayer's expense.
In any case, those who propose this amendment are barking up the wrong tree, because it is the Member States that guarantee such arrangements.
Subsidiarité oblige!
<D>
President-in-Office. - (SL) I am honoured to be with you again today and, as President of the Council, to present to you the evaluation of the results of the Bali Climate Change Conference.
I am very pleased that the European Parliament took a very active role and was involved in the debate on climate change.
A strong delegation of the European Parliament led by the Vice-President of the Parliament, Mr Vidal-Quadras, and consisting of a number of eminent representatives of the Parliament, was also present at the Bali Conference.
I would also like to express support for the first interim report on climate change presented last Monday to your Climate Change Committee.
Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, the last days of the Conference were conducted in a very, so to speak, electrified atmosphere of uncertainty.
When it seemed that the negotiations would fail and that an agreement would not be reached, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr Ban Ki-moon, also became involved and his intervention was important.
The fact that the negotiations were extended by one day and that they were conducted through the last two nights is testimony to their difficulty.
The final agreement resulted in a decision on long-term cooperation within the framework of the Convention under the title Bali Action Plan.
In compliance with this document, negotiations will start as early as March or April and, by the end of next year, should lead to a full global agreement on tackling climate change after 2012.
Allow me to mention some essential elements of this agreement: firstly the part relating to international measures for improving, that is, reducing emissions.
This agreement stresses that the efforts of all developed countries to reduce emissions must be comparable with each other.
This means that the United States of America will also be included in the reduction of emissions.
Here we must stress that, unlike the Kyoto Protocol for 2008-2012, this plan does not secure any quantified obligations.
The second element is that developing countries will contribute to the reduction in emissions within the framework of sustainable development.
This is where the support of developed countries, with the transfer of technology and suitable finances, is very important.
Alleviation of the effects of climate change will also include measures and positive encouragement to prevent the clearing and destruction of forests in developing countries, which makes a large contribution to the global emissions of greenhouse gases.
The third element consists of improved adaptation measures to include international cooperation.
The fourth includes improved measures for the development and transfer of technologies that enable adaptation and alleviation concomitantly with economic development.
For more effective alleviation of, and adaptation to, climate change, it is necessary to secure easier access to environmentally friendly technologies for developing countries.
The fifth decision relates to improved financing and investment in the alleviation of climate change.
This foresees support for developing countries to implement the national measures for the alleviation of, and adaptation to, climate change.
Further negotiations will take place under the auspices of a newly established ad hoc working group for long-term cooperation within the framework of the Convention.
They will already be meeting four times this year.
The negotiation process will be intensive and will demand great efforts on the part of the negotiators.
The current negotiations relating to the post-2012 obligations of developed countries that signed the Kyoto Protocol will continue.
These negotiations should also be concluded by the end of next year.
They will run in parallel with the negotiations within the Bali Action Plan.
In our opinion, the decisions adopted at the Bali Conference are appropriate.
They contain essential elements towards which we in the European Union are striving.
Among the greatest achievements is the involvement of all countries, developed and developing, in the common reduction of emissions.
We acknowledge the equality of inclusive adaptation.
We expect the Bali Action Plan to shift the deadlock on the transfer of climate-friendly technologies to developing countries.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Conference gave us a broad framework for further negotiations.
This compromise is, in a way, the most that could be achieved in view of the current state of the global consensus.
Future negotiations will be technically and politically very demanding.
We are of the opinion that they will have a successful outcome if we manage to preserve the trend evident over the last year, when climate change has continued to climb up the political agenda.
To reach an effective international agreement, we will need stamina and patience as well as a lot of political will.
Sometimes, the most necessary measures are last to be accepted.
<D>
Madam President, my contribution today will be one that highlights the need for investment: investment in jobs; investment in our environment; and investment in all our economies.
In that regard, investment in our transport infrastructure and, in particular, in our railway infrastructure, is crucial, not only in providing us with a world-class rail network but also in protecting and creating jobs and social cohesion.
Let us prioritise the electrification of our rail network, giving us both transport and environmental gains.
Let us invest in our TENS transport network.
Let us have a recovery plan with substance and with action, and not just words.
Doing nothing and letting the markets decide has failed.
The time for concerted European action is now based on putting people first and vested interests last.
We on this side of the House are not prepared to play Pontius Pilate, washing our hands of the problem.
We want to act and we want to act decisively.
<D>
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all I would like to express my appreciation for the work of Mrs McGuinness on this report, which I know she did in difficult circumstances.
She has succeeded in illustrating the great variety of the work of the Committee on Petitions and I would like to reconfirm, as I have no doubt she expects, the Commission's willingness to cooperate in all ways we can with the work of the committee.
I would just like to pick up on two of the points she makes in the brief presentation of the report.
Mrs McGuinness, first of all you underline the importance of direct contact between Parliament and the everyday, very real concerns of citizens who petition you.
I agree, and I should know.
You have dealt with nearly a hundred petitions coming from Malta since 2004, which is a rather high rate when taken pro rata to the population.
Some of these petitions are common to many other Member States as well, but many were quite specific to Malta.
This demonstrates the useful direct contact with the citizen that the committee provides.
In addition it is also true to say that a good collaboration with the national authorities and the organisation of fact-finding missions are definitely useful ingredients for your work.
Besides agreeing on the importance of working directly with citizens, the second thing I would like to pick up on is the general issue of fundamental rights.
They crop up in many places in your report, whether about nationality and related rights, individual and family rights or the right of property, and as you know it very often happens that people who petition Parliament about their fundamental rights end up being disappointed.
This is because such rights, more often than not, turn out to be outside the scope of Community law, as you have just rightly pointed out.
To use your own words, there is a lot to be done to separate the wheat from the chaff, those concerns which we can work on and those on which we cannot.
My wish, my very sincere wish, is that your report will help people to see this clearly and realistically.
With these two comments, which I am sure will be taken in the spirit in which they are intended, I would just like to say that I wish the rapporteur every success and thank her again for this report.
<D>
One who is another's property and a helpless victim of some dominating influence - you might be forgiven for thinking this is a definition of human trafficking.
In fact, it is a definition of slavery.
Trafficking is today's slavery.
Trafficking of people, be it women, men or children, is a criminal offence and on the increase in all Member States.
Extreme poverty, family breakdown and domestic violence contribute to some of the root causes of human trafficking.
In the UK, we estimate approximately 5 000 victims, of which 330 are children.
The ECR Group welcomes this debate.
National governments, law-enforcement agencies and border-control agencies need to work together.
Mechanisms for victim support need strengthening.
Initiatives must be robust, Member State-driven and EU-supported.
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (PL) Madam President, Commissioner, an unquestionable weakness of the current provisions of enforcement legislation is the situation in which, having verified enforceability of a court order in another Member State, enforcement remains the exclusive competence of national legislation.
Pursuant to Community legal acts currently in force there is no way of obtaining an order to attach a bank account that could be enforced across the territory of the entire European Union.
That is why a European system for an order allowing the attachment of bank accounts seems to be such an appropriate and necessary solution.
It would allow creditors to secure the sums due or the value of their claim by making it impossible to withdraw or transfer funds deposited in one or many bank accounts across the territory of the European Union.
Such a system should be created following the development of an additional independent procedure that would stand alongside national provisions with the proviso that it would only apply to cross-border issues.
It is worth emphasising that such an order would only have a preventive effect.
In other words, it would block the debtor's funds in the latter's bank account, without transferring them to the creditor's account.
The court must of course refrain from hearing or informing the debtor of the proceedings before attaching his or her bank account, otherwise the effect might be the opposite of what was intended.
The sum to be attached should be calculated on the basis of the creditor's claim.
It should be emphasised, however, that the debtor must have the right to appeal the order issued, and the competent institution to hear that appeal should be the court where the order was issued.
Provision should also be made for derogations from enforcement to allow the basic needs of the debtor and his or her family to be met.
Clearly, at that stage, additional comparative legal analysis would be required, as many aspects call for further investigation.
Nonetheless, the fact remains that the introduction of a Community legal procedure such as a European order for the attachment of bank accounts aimed at streamlining the implementation of monetary claims and improving effectiveness would be a milestone along the road to the creation of a European economic and judicial area.
In conclusion, I should like to congratulate Mr Lechner on an outstanding and well-prepared report.
The House must be well aware, of course, of how difficult it is to change Union provisions, particularly in this field.
<D>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, it gives me great pleasure to welcome Mr Toubon's report this morning, not just on behalf of my group, as coordinator, but also on behalf of my colleague, our Vice-Chairman Mrs Thyssen, who sadly is not able to be with us this morning because she has had to rush back to Belgium, where her parents are not at all well.
I welcome this report on behalf of all the Members of our group.
One of the most important aspects of Mr Toubon's excellent work is the way that he has taken a very all-embracing and very comprehensive view of the single market, as he identified in his speech.
In a real sense, the single market touches the lives of every citizen in the European Union.
The problem is, that single market and its success and its future development are far too often taken for granted.
As Mr Toubon said, it is absolutely right to issue a strong call to all of us and particularly to the Commission in its work on a new strategy to come up with some radical, new ideas and particularly to raise the whole political profile of the single market and its importance to all of us.
It needs the Member States and the Prime Ministers at their summit in March, when they will look at this document, really to take advantage of that.
The second point - and I am pleased that you reinforced this, Commissioner - is the whole global dimension.
It is absolutely clear that a fully functioning single market is a massive competitive advantage for Europe in the global economy.
It is the responsibility of all of us, all colleagues, to maintain that decisive competitive advantage on behalf of all our citizens.
We are only going to achieve that by clear, far-sighted advocacy of the benefits and of the policies to keep moving the single market forward on behalf of all our citizens, as is done so well in this report.
<D>
We can all agree with the intention of the European Commission to achieve a competitive social market economy.
The Commission's reports contain specific proposals on strengthening the single market.
We trust that they will be implemented.
According to Commissioner Barnier, we need to take advantage of single market opportunities that have not been exploited so far.
Indeed, many achievements can be listed which have simplified our life within the EU.
However, the changes taking place in the world demand further measures.
The single market can be made even more unified.
I value the notion that the markets must serve both the economy and the citizens of the EU at one and the same time.
The rights of citizens and economic issues are dealt with in separate documents.
Hopefully, the reason for this is to balance these two poles of the market.
The EU's role as initiator and coordinator in strengthening the single market is indisputable.
However, without the Member States' commitment to implementation, we will have to wait for a long time for a good social system, high education standards and competitive jobs.
Although some question the importance of open consultation, I believe that all stakeholders should have an opportunity to express their opinion.
Similarly, I believe that the initiative to debate matters concerning the single market in the framework of an annual forum is a positive one.
The participants of this debate are logically the institutions, Member States, enterprises and citizens, in other words, all those involved in the single market.
The forum will also help raise awareness of the single market being part of our everyday lives.

- Madam President, the European Parliament's priority today has to be to get the largest majority possible for the Commission proposal to extend and make permanent the option to lower VAT rates on labour-intensive services.
This is not an issue for political grandstanding or, indeed, promoting pet projects.
Thousands of low-skilled jobs are being lost every day in every Member State.
Low VAT rates have been shown to encourage employment in services, assist SMEs, and, indeed, make the informal economy less attractive.
Our responsibility here today is to deliver a strong message to our Member State governments to get on with it.
The construction sector badly needs a boost - renovations, repairs, and installations will help achieve energy efficiency, as well as helping employment.
Restaurants, childcare and care of the elderly would also benefit.
I support the rapporteur's approach and I hope that my own government, the Irish Government, will opt into this proposal, which unfortunately it has not done to date.
<D>
It is important for the European Parliament to engage in positive cooperation with the Commission and Council.
In this respect, I welcome today's debate on the conclusions of the European Council meeting (25-26 March 2010).
Particular attention was focused, among the topics discussed, on the 'Europe 2020' economic strategy, as well as on the preparation for the international climate change negotiations.
I think that we are all affected by the problems in the euro area, as the euro's stability is of paramount importance to the whole of the European Union.
The European Council will play a more important role in coordinating at national and European level instruments intended to boost Member States' economic performance.
Against this background, solutions relating only to budgetary problems are inadequate, as these problems are closely linked to economic problems.
I support the European Council's objectives of raising the level of employment, especially through policies aimed at supporting young people.
The conditions for increasing investments in research and innovation must be improved.
Realistic objectives must be set not only in this area, but also when it comes to setting climate change targets.
The European Commission must put forward as soon as possible specific measures intended to implement the projects aimed at reducing poverty across the whole European Union.
<D>
I welcome the role that Europe has played as the largest provider of development aid in the world.
Development aid has helped to alleviate poverty for millions of people in the developing world.
The number of people having to endure extreme poverty has fallen from 1.8 billion to 1.4 billion.
Almost 90% of poor children now attend school.
Great steps have been made in combating malaria and tuberculosis, and the infant mortality rate is falling dramatically.
However, the recent food and fuel crises and the global economic recession have cancelled out much of the progress made over the last decade.
The rich countries are responsible for the current financial, economic and climate crises, but the developing countries are the most affected by global warming.
This means that it is vital for us to step up all our measures for combating climate change, such as providing appropriate technology.
I would like to call for additional funds to be earmarked for developing countries.
These should be sustainable in the medium and long term and come from the private sector, the carbon market, and the public sector of industrialised countries or the most economically advanced developing countries.
<D>
Mr President, I am grateful to the Prime Minister for his statement this morning and, whilst I note the decisions of the Heads of Government, the British people and the British Conservative Party have been consistent in their concerns about the Constitution and the very similar Reform Treaty.
The British Prime Minister has said that the Reform Treaty is not the Constitution.
His fellow leaders have disagreed.
He told us that Britain's so-called 'red lines' have been secured.
Like most British people I really do not understand or believe our Prime Minister on this matter.
The issue is one of trust.
Our Prime Minister gave a commitment to hold a referendum - a commitment in an election manifesto two years ago.
A referendum on this Treaty is, therefore, not only politically necessary but also a moral imperative.
The Irish Prime Minister said at the weekend about possible referenda: 'Why not let your people have a say?
I think it's a bit upsetting to see so many countries running away from giving their people an opportunity'.
A few days ago, Gordon Brown said that this Treaty will mark the end of EU institutional reform for the next decade.
However, over the past 15 years we have had four treaties dealing with reform, and I doubt whether the urge to have further institutional change can be resisted.
The so-called 'ratchet clause', for example, would allow further national vetoes to be abolished.
On the other hand, the Conservative vision for Europe focuses on the three key areas of global competitiveness, global climate change and global poverty.
I congratulate President Barroso in particular for his determination, in any event, to pursue those aims.
However, they can be tackled with political will and do not require this Treaty.
We should remind ourselves of what the Laeken Declaration said.
It said the Union needs to become more democratic, more transparent and more efficient, but it called also for us to engage the citizens more and not just to communicate our decisions to them.
The question today is: does the Treaty respond to Laeken?
Laeken asked the right questions.
Have we given the right answers?
<D>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, speaking earlier, Mr Catania said that the European public was afraid that the rule of law was disintegrating.
The European public reads in today's newspapers of the arrest of terrorists in Denmark who had made definite plans for attacks.
The German public awoke today to the news that three terrorists had been planning an attack on Frankfurt am Main airport.
The public is afraid.
It is worried.
Terrorism in Europe has caused deaths and a great deal of suffering.
The public expects to be safe.
Tackling this is our task as European politicians.
What is the European response?
Hearing the President-in-Office of the Council today, I realised that stagnation and paralysis have taken hold here.
I am disappointed.
As we know, terrorism is networked across Europe.
The cells cooperate by means of the Internet and using various methods.
The Ministers of the Interior are doing their own thing at national level and believing that they have things under control.
I, too, am in favour of an evaluation and of our now putting to the test the measures we have implemented, but we also need new momentum.
Terrorism has not been defeated.
We need a fresh start.
That is why the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats supports the Commission's initiatives.
Terrorism is directed at our way of life, and therefore I should like to emphasise that combating it is a cultural challenge.
For example, Europe stands for gender equality, so we want no forced marriages in Europe.
Anyone forcing young girls into marriage must be punished.
Europe stands for tolerance, and so we want no preachers of hate, with their condemnation of other religions.
I am in favour of expelling such people from Europe.
I would say to all preachers: no god approves of murder.
I would ask that today's debate be used to give backing to the Council and, in particular, to our Commission, which has put forward good proposals, so as to generate new momentum.
<D>
. - (SV) Thank you, Mr President.
Schadenfreude is the only true joy, says the cynic.
However, even those of us who are not cynical naturally admit that Schadenfreude is a form of joy, and it is this sort of joy that I am feeling now.
Why?
Well, last year we in the June List and the Independence and Democracy Group started to request roll-call votes in all final votes.
I remember how President Pöttering scolded us, derided us and claimed that it cost the earth.
Now the committee is proposing that all final votes on legislative proposals be conducted as roll-call votes.
And quite rightly, too!
In order to be able to demand political responsibility from their MEPs, voters must be able to check how they voted.
How did Mr Hannan, Mrs Wallis or Mrs Svensson vote, to name just a few of my favourite Members?
This proposal constitutes an important step towards a democratic process and it strengthens voters' control of the 'yes-men' in this House.
I would like to thank Mr Corbett for this and to thank the President for allowing me to speak.
<D>
(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Turmes on his report and the Commission on its initiative.
Many of us believe that the European Union must consider support for renewable energies and energy efficiency as not just an integral part of its energy and climate change strategy, but also an integral part of its development policy.
Therefore, the proposal to create a Global Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Fund to mobilise private investment for developing countries and economies in transition is very interesting.
What is needed for ideal modest financing is the establishment of priorities and synergies with other existing programmes and with the World Bank and regional development banks, which are increasingly investing in renewable energies and in energy efficiency.
However, after the first few years of implementation of the new instrument the results will have to be assessed and efforts made to encourage substantial increases in the contributions from the actors concerned.
I agree that everything suggests at present that the support should principally target Africa and Latin America.
<D>
rapporteur. - Mr President, I welcome the general support we have heard this afternoon for the European Asylum Support Office and would very much like to thank colleagues for their cooperation and the work that we have been doing on this.
We hope that we can get this office up and running as soon as possible.
Its aim, of course, is to improve confidence between Member States as the delivery of asylum systems improves on the basis of the practical cooperation between experts, the training and everything else involved.
Maybe, as that confidence improves, we will see Member States less worried about the fact that they might have to cooperate in an obligatory way to fulfil obligations.
I welcome the Commissioner's clarity about the different missions of the Asylum Support Office and Frontex.
They are very different things with very different purposes, although of course the cooperation and the delivery are important within them.
One of the aspects that has been touched upon has been that of information about third countries - the countries of origin of those seeking international protection.
Of course this is one of the things that the Asylum Support Office will be looking at: how to pull together that information from a variety of sources in a more standard format and perhaps a format where people will have greater confidence that the information is not being used politically.
I think it is something of great wonder to many of us how one country will accept people from Chechnya as refugees with quite a high acceptance rate, whereas another country close by will not accept anybody from Chechnya.
Many of us find this absolutely impossible to believe when the same information is out there.
So confidence in the quality of information and the way in which it can then be used by Member States is also an extremely important part of the enhanced cooperation we will be seeing.
We look forward to seeing this coming into being.
<D>
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my first words will be to congratulate my fellow Member Mrs Hall, the rapporteur on this complex matter, for her willingness to cooperate with the rapporteurs from the political Groups.
I include in this my excellent colleague Mrs Niebler, Chair of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, the committee responsible, which does a superb job.
The compromise proposed is satisfactory.
It is the fruit of long discussions that we had with the Slovenian Presidency, which I congratulate on the quality of its work, and should enable us to reach an agreement at first reading so that mobile satellite services will be provided quickly.
This matter is a great European success, and well done, Commissioner, because in the future, systems supplying mobile satellite services, such as high-speed data transfer or mobile television, will be selected at European level.
This is evidence of efficiency, better economy and Community preference.
We are aware of the compromise.
We have come a long way, and I welcome the fact that the Commission has accepted an increase in the services provided to citizens, as each system will have to cover 60% of the territory of the Union from the start and the whole of the territory at the latest seven years after the launch.
I am pleased that the major criteria for the coverage required was territory and not solely population, which means that our rural and outlying areas can be served.
This is something that is close to my heart, as I come from a rural region that took a long time, and is still taking time, to benefit from the technological infrastructures as have the large urban areas, and it is about equal opportunities for citizens wherever they are in European Union territory.
Once the text has been adopted in Parliament and approved by the Council, I ask the Commission to do everything to quickly establish mobile satellite services according to reasonable pricing that needs to be monitored.
These services are major financial and technological challenges, but they mean that Europe has the opportunity to equip itself with an advanced sector in terms of satellite services.
Finally, I hope that the boldness and brilliance of our European manufacturers will enable them to submit to this political compromise, proving once again their huge capacity for technological adaptation.
